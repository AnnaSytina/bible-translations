 <a name="fn3" href="nah.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:2) <i>Heb </i>"jealous." The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aNq</FONT> ("jealous; zealous") refers to God's zealous protection of his people and his furious judgment against his enemies. The root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">anq </FONT>can denote jealous envy (Gen 26:14; 30:1; 37:11; Pss 37:1; 73:3; 106:16; Prov 3:31; 23:17; 24:1, 19; Ezek 31:9), jealous rivalry (Eccl 4:4; 9:6; Isa 11:13), marital jealousy (Num 5:14, 15, 18, 25, 30; Prov 6:34; 27:4), zealous loyalty (Num 11:29; 25:11, 13; 2 Sam 21:2; 1 Kgs 19:10, 14; 2 Kgs 10:16; Ps 69:10; Song 8:6; Isa 9:6; 37:32; 42:13; 59:17; 63:15; Zech 1:14; 8:2), jealous anger (Deut 32:16, 21; Ps 78:58), and zealous fury (Exod 34:14; Deut 5:9; 29:19; 1 Kgs 14:22; Job 5:2; Pss 79:5; 119:139; Prov 14:30; Isa 26:11; Ezek 5:13; 8:3; 16:38, 42; 23:25; 35:11; 36:5, 6; 38:19; Zeph 1:18). See BDB 888; <i>TDOT</i> 2:802-3.<br>
 <a name="fn4" href="nah.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  The syntax of this line has been understood in two ways: (1) as a single clause with the LORD as the subject: "A jealous and avenging God is the LORD" (NRSV; NASB) or "The LORD is a jealous and avenging God" (NIV); and (2) as two parallel clauses: "God is jealous, and the LORD avenges" (KJV). The LXX reflects the latter: "God is jealous, and the Lord avenges" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Qeov" zhlwthV" kaiv ejkdikw'n kuvrio"</FONT>). Masoretic accentuation and Hebrew syntax supports the former. Accentuation links <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;q@n{w+ aoNq^</FONT> ("jealous and avenging") together rather than dividing them into separate clauses. Normal word order suggests that<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> &lt;q@n{w+ awN{q^</FONT> ("jealous and avenging") are attributive adjectives modifying <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la@</FONT> ("God"). In verbless clauses such as this, the predicate normally precedes the subject; thus, "a jealous and avenging God" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;q@n{w+ awN{q^ la@</FONT>) is the predicate and "the LORD" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hw&#180;hy+</FONT>) is the subject.<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="nah.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:2) Or "very angry"; <i>Heb </i>"a lord of wrath." The idiom "lord of wrath" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*j@ lu^b^W</FONT>) means "wrathful" or "full of wrath" (Prov 22:24; 29:22). The noun "lord" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu^b^W</FONT>) is used in construct as an idiom to describe a person's outstanding characteristic or attribute (e.g., Gen 37:19; 1 Sam 28:7; 2 Kgs 1:8; Prov 1:17; 18:9; 22:24; 23:2; 24:8; Eccl 7:12; 8:8; 10:11, 20; Isa 41:15; 50:8; Dan 8:6, 20); see Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Hebrew Syntax,</i> &#167;9.5.3.b.<br>
 <a name="fn6" href="nah.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;qn</FONT> ("avenge, vengeance") is repeated three times in 1:2 for emphasis. The LORD will exact just retribution against his enemies (the Assyrians) to avenge their wickedness against his people (Judah).<br>
 <a name="fn7" href="nah.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  The verb "rage" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rfn</FONT>) is used elsewhere of keeping a vineyard (Song 1:6; 8:11-12) and guarding a secret (Dan 7:28). When used of anger, it does not so much mean "to control anger" or "to be slow to anger" (<i>HALOT</i> 695) but "to stay angry" (<i>TWOT</i> 2:576). It describes a person bearing a grudge, seeking revenge, and refusing to forgive (Lev 19:18). It is often used as a synonym of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rmv</FONT> ("to maintain wrath, stay angry") in collocation with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;loul</FONT> ("forever, always") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dul</FONT> ("continually") to picture God harboring rage against his enemies forever (Jer 3:5, 12; Amos 1:11; Ps 103:9). The long-term rage depicted by <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rfn</FONT> ("maintain rage") serves as an appropriate bridge to the following statement in Nahum that the LORD is slow to anger but furious in judgment. God seeks vengeance against his enemies; he continually rages and maintains his anger; he is slow to anger, but will eventually burst out with the full fury of his wrath.<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="nah.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:3) <i>Heb </i>"long of anger," i.e., slow of anger (Exod 34:6; Num 14:18; Joel 2:13; Jon 4:2; Pss 86:15; 103:8; 145:8; Prov 14:29; 15:18; 16:32; Neh 9:17) or restraining anger (Jer 15:15; Prov 25:15).<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="nah.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:3)  The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest emending MT "power" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jK</FONT>) to "mercy" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dsj</FONT>) as in Exod 34:6; Num 14:18; Joel 2:13; Jon 4:2; Ps 103:8; Neh 9:17. However, this is unnecessary, it has no textual support, and it misses the rhetorical point intended by Nahum's modification of the traditional expression.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:3)  This is an allusion to the well-known statement, "The LORD is slow to anger but great in mercy" (Exod 34:6; Num 14:18; Joel 2:13; Jon 4:2; Ps 103:8; Neh 9:17). Nahum subtly modifies this by substituting "great in mercy" with "great in power." God's patience at the time of Jonah (Jon 4:2) one century earlier (ca. 750 B.C.), had run out. Nineveh had exhausted the "great mercy" of God and now would experience the "great power" of God. <br>
 <a name="fn10" href="nah.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:3) Or "he will certainly not acquit [the wicked]." The root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hqn</FONT> ("to acquit") is repeated twice for emphasis. The phrase "he will certainly not allow the wicked to go unpunished" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hQ#n~y+ aO) hQ@n~w+</FONT>) is an emphatic construction (see GKC &#167;75.<i>hh</i>; Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Hebrew Syntax,</i> &#167;35.3.1).<br>
 <a name="fn11" href="nah.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:3) The words "the wicked" are not in the Hebrew text but are supplied in the translation; they are implied when this idiom is used (Exod 34:7; Num 14:18). In legal contexts the nuance "the guilty" is most appropriate; in non-legal contexts the nuance "the wicked" is used.<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="nah.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:3) <i>Heb </i>"His way is in the whirlwind." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">oKr+D~</FONT> ("his way") is nuanced here in a verbal sense. The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Er\D\</FONT> often denotes a "journey" (Gen 28:20; 30:36; 45:23; Num 9:10; Josh 9:13; 1 Sam 21:6; 1 Kgs 18:27). The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Er~D&#180; </FONT>often means "to tread a path" (Job 22:15) and "to march out" (Judg 5:21). The LORD is portrayed as the Divine Warrior marching out to battle (Exod 15:1-12; Deut 33:2; Judg 5:4-5; Pss 18:7-15; 68:4-10, 32-35; 77:16-19; Mic 1:3-4; Hab 3:3-15).<br>

 <a name="fn15" href="nah.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ruG</FONT> often denotes "reprimand" and "rebuke." When it is used in the context of a military attack, it denotes an angry battle cry shouted by a mighty warrior to strike fear into his enemies to drive them away (e.g., 2 Sam 23:16; Isa 30:17; Pss 18:15; 76:6; 80:17; 104:7). For example, the parallel Ugaritic term is used when Baal utters a battle cry against Yamm before they fight to the death. For further study see, A. A. MacIntosh, "A Consideration of Hebrew g&#180;r," <i>VT</i> 14 (1969): 474; P. J. van Zijl, "A Consideration of the root <i>ga&#180;ar</i> ("rebuke")," <i>OTWSA</i> 12 (1969): 56-63; A. Caquot, <i>TDOT</i> 3:49-53.<br>
 <a name="fn16" href="nah.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:4)  The "sea" is personified is an antagonistic enemy, representing the wicked forces of chaos (Pss 66:6; 72:8; 80:12; 89:26; 93:3-4; Isa 50:2; Mic 7:12; Hab 3:8; Zech 9:10).<br>
 <a name="fn17" href="nah.htm#fnB17"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  This somewhat unusual use of the preterite (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Whv@B=Y~w~</FONT>) follows a participle which depicts characteristic (present-time) action or imminent future action; the preterite depicts the subsequent present or future-time action (see Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Hebrew Syntax,</i> &#167;33.3.5.c).<br>
 <a name="fn18" href="nah.htm#fnB18"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:4)  The Assyrians waged war every spring after the Tigris and Euphrates rivers dried up, allowing them to cross. As the Mighty Warrior par excellence, the LORD is able to part the rivers to attack Assyria.<br>
 <a name="fn19" href="nah.htm#fnB19"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ll^m=a%</FONT> ("withers") occurs twice in this verse in MT. The repetition of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">llma</FONT> is also supported by the Dead Sea Scrolls (4QpNah). The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest emending the <i>first</i> occurrence of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ll^m=a%</FONT> ("withers") to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wll=D&#180;</FONT> ("languishes") to recover the letter <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">D</FONT> (<i>dalet</i>) in the partial acrostic. Several versions do, in fact, employ two different verbs in the line (LXX, Syr, Targum, and Vg). However, the <i>first</i> verb at the <i>beginning</i> of the line in all of the versions reflects a reading of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ll^m=a%</FONT>. Although several elements of an acrostic are present in Nahum 1, the acrostic is incomplete (only <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">a</FONT> [<i>alef</i>] to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">K</FONT> [<i>kaf</i>] in vv. 2-8) and broken (several elements are missing within vv. 2-8). There is no textual evidence for a complete, unbroken acrostic throughout the Book of Nahum in any ancient Hebrew MSS or other textual versions; it is most prudent simply to leave the MT as it stands.<br>
 <a name="fn20" href="nah.htm#fnB20"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  <i>Heb </i>"withers...withers..."<br>
 <a name="fn21" href="nah.htm#fnB21"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:5) Or "because of him." The Hebrew preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WNM#m! </FONT>is taken in a causal sense ("because of him") by NASB, NJPS; however, it is taken in a locative sense ("before him") by KJV, NKJV, NRSV, NIV. On the other hand, the LXX rendered it in a separative sense: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajp' aujtou' </FONT>("from him"). The parallelism between 1:5a and 1:5b seems to favor the locative nuance: "The mountains quake before him (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WNM#m!</FONT>), the earth is laid waste before him (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wyn&#180;P*m!</FONT>)."<br>
 <a name="fn22" href="nah.htm#fnB22"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:5) Traditionally, "the hills melt." Translations traditionally render <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wgg&#180;m)t=h! </FONT>as "melt" (KJV, NRSV, NIV, NJPS) or "dissolve" (NASB). The LXX renders it "are shaken" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejsaleuvqhsan</FONT>). The Hebrew root has a range of meanings: (1) "to melt," of courage (Ps 107:26) or troops retreating ("melting away" in fear) in battle (1 Sam 14:16); (2) "to dissolve," of mountains dissolving due to erosion (Amos 9:13); (3) "to quake, shake apart," of mountains quaking, swaying backwards and forwards, coming apart, and collapsing in an earthquake (Amos 9:5; Pss 46:6 [7]; 75:3 [4]). The latter fits the imagery of v. 5 (violent earthquakes): the earth trembles in fear at the approach of the Divine Warrior (e.g., Hab 3:6).<br>
 <a name="fn23" href="nah.htm#fnB23"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:5) Or "is upheaved"; or "heaves." There is debate whether the originally unpointed Hebrew verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">a?tw</FONT> should be vocalized as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aC*T!w+</FONT> (NASB "is upheaved"; NRSV, NJPS "heaves") from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">acn</FONT> ("to lift up") or as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aV*T!w~ </FONT> ("is devastated, laid waste") from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hav</FONT> ("to devastate, lay waste"). The vocalization <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aC*T!w+</FONT> is attested in the Masoretic tradition and the Greek versions: Origen ("was raised up"), Symmachus ("was moved"), and Aquilla ("shivered"). However, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aC*T!w+</FONT> demands an intransitive ("heaves") or passive ("is upheaved") sense which is not attested for the Qal stem. The vocalization <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aV*T!w~</FONT> ("is devastated, laid waste") is supported by the Syriac and Vulgate. The revocalization of the MT <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aC*T!w+</FONT> ("is lifted up") to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aV*T!w~</FONT> ("is devastated") is suggested by the <i>BHS</i> editors and several Hebrew lexicons (<i>HALOT</i> 726; BDB 670-71). The revocalization involves only the difference between the form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">c</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">v</FONT> and is followed in the present translation.<br>
 <a name="fn24" href="nah.htm#fnB24"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:5)  The phrase "the world and its inhabitants" is used to stress the universal dimensions of God's revelation of his glory and his acts of judgment (e.g., Pss 33:8; 98:7; Isa 18:3; 26:9, 18; Lam 4:12).<br>
 <a name="fn25" href="nah.htm#fnB25"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  The words "are laid waste" are not in the Hebrew text, but are an implied repetition from the previous line.<br>
 <a name="fn26" href="nah.htm#fnB26"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:6) <i>Heb</i> "stand before." The Hebrew verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dmu</FONT> ("stand") here denotes "to resist, withstand." It is used elsewhere of warriors taking a stand in battle to hold their ground against enemies (Judg 2:14; Josh 10:8; 21:44; 23:9; 2 Kgs 10:4; Dan 11:16; Amos 2:15). It is also used of people trying to protect their lives from enemy attack (Esth 8:11; 9:16). Like a mighty warrior, the LORD will attack his enemies, but none will be able to make a stand against him; none will be able to hold their ground against him; and none will be able to protect themselves from his onslaught (Pss 76:7[8]; 147:17; Mal 3:2). <br>
 <a name="fn27" href="nah.htm#fnB27"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:6) <i>Heb </i>"Who can stand before his indignation?" The rhetorical question expects a negative answer; it is translated here as an emphatic denial. The Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;uz</FONT> ("indignation; curse") connotes the angry wrath or indignant curse of God (Isa 10:5, 25; 13:5; 26:20; 30:27; Jer 10:10; 15:17; 50:25; Ezek 21:36; 22:24, 31; Hab 3:12; Zeph 3:8; Pss 38:4; 69:25; 78:49; 102:11; Lam 2:6; Dan 8:19; 11:36). It depicts anger expressed in the form of punishment (<i>HALOT</i> 276; <i>TWOT</i> 1:247).<br>
 <a name="fn28" href="nah.htm#fnB28"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:6) <i>Heb </i>"Who can rise up against...?" The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;Wqy&#180;</FONT> ("arise") is here a figurative expression connoting resistance. Although the adversative sense of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B</FONT> with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;Wqy&#180;</FONT> ("against him") is attested, denoting hostile action taken against one's enemy (Mic. 7:6; Ps. 27:12), the locative sense ("before him") is preferred due to the parallelism with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn}p=l!</FONT> ("before him").<br>
 <a name="fn29" href="nah.htm#fnB29"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:6) <i>Heb </i>"Who can rise up against the heat of his anger?" The rhetorical question expects a negative answer which is translated as an emphatic denial to clarify the point. <br>

The Niphal perfect <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WxT=n]</FONT> from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jtn</FONT> ("to break up, throw down") may denote "are broken up" or "are thrown down."

This merely involves the simple transposition of the second and third consonants. This emendation is supported by a few Hebrew MSS (cited in <i>BHS</i> apparatus). It is supported contextually by fire and heat motifs in 1:5-6. The same metathesis of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WxT=n] </FONT>and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WTX=n] </FONT>occurs in Jer 4:26.<br>
 <a name="fn31" href="nah.htm#fnB31"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  <i>Heb </i>"before him."<br>
 <a name="fn32" href="nah.htm#fnB32"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  The Masoretic disjunctive accent marker (<i>zaqeph parvum</i>) divides the lines here. Most English translations reflect this line division (KJV, RSV, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NKJV). Some extend the line: "Yahweh is better than a fortress" (NJB); "The LORD is good to those who hope in him" (NJPS); and "The LORD is good to those who trust him" (NEB). This issue is complicated by the textual problems in this verse.<br>
 <a name="fn33" href="nah.htm#fnB33"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l=</FONT> probably functions in an emphatic asseverative sense, suggested by D. L. Christensen, "The Acrostic of Nahum Reconsidered," <i>ZAW</i> 87 (1975): 22. This explains the preceding statement: the LORD is good to his people (1:7a) because--like a fortress--he protects them in time of distress (1:7b).<br>
 <a name="fn34" href="nah.htm#fnB34"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tc </b> (1:7) Some ancient versions read, "The LORD is good to those who trust him." The MT reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">zoum*l=</FONT> ("a fortress"): the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">zoum*</FONT> ("fortress") with the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l=</FONT> (see below). However, the LXX (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uJpomenouvsin aujtovn</FONT>, "to those who trust him") reflects the reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">zyu!ml=</FONT> ("to those who trust [him]"): the Hiphil participle from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">zWu </FONT>("seek refuge") with the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l=</FONT>. The variants involve only different vocalizations and the common confusion of <i>vav</i> with <i>yod</i>. Most English translations follow the traditional Hebrew reading (KJV, RSV, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NKJV); however, several others follow the alternate Greek reading (NEB, NJPS). The <i>BHS</i> editors and several other scholars favor the LXX tradition (Cathcart 1973; Roberts 1991; Rudolph 1975; Levenson 1975; Longman 1993); however, the Masoretic tradition has been defended by others (Maier 1959; Cathcart 1973, 1979; Smith 1984; Patterson 1991). The Masoretic tradition is supported by the Dead Sea Scrolls (4QpNah). The problem with the LXX reading is the absence of the direct object in the Hebrew text; the LXX is forced to supply the direct object <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aujtovn</FONT> ("him"). (For a similar addition of the direct object <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aujtovn </FONT>("him") by the LXX, see Amos 9:12.) The main objection to the MT reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">zoum*l=</FONT> ("a fortress") is that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l=</FONT> is hard to explain. However, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l=</FONT> may be taken in a comparative sense (Cathcart: "Yahweh is better than a fortress in time of distress") or an asseverative sense (Christensen: "Yahweh is good; indeed, a fortress in time of distress"). See K. J. Cathcart, <i>Nahum in the Light of Northwest Semitic Studies</i>, 55; idem, "More Philological Studies in Nahum," <i>JNSL</i> 7 (1979): 4; D. L. Christensen, "The Acrostic of Nahum Reconsidered," <i>ZAW</i> 87 (1975): 22. Elsewhere, the LORD is commonly portrayed as a "fortress" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">zoum*</FONT>) protecting his people (Pss 27:1; 28:8; 31:3, 5; 37:39; 43:2; 52:9; Isa 17:10; 25:4; 27:5; Joel 4:16; Jer 16:19; Neh 8:10; Prov 10:29).<br>
 <a name="fn35" href="nah.htm#fnB35"><sup>36</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:7)  The phrase "time of distress" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hr&#180;x* &lt;oyB=</FONT>) refers to situations in which God's people are oppressed by enemy armies (Isa 33:2; Jer 14:8; 15:11; 16:19; Obad 12; Pss 20:2; 37:39). Nahum may be alluding to recent Assyrian invasions of Judah, such as Sennacherib's devastating invasion in 701 B.C., in which the LORD protected the remnant within the fortress walls of Jerusalem (2 Kgs 18-19; 2 Chr 32; Isa 36-37).<br>
 <a name="fn36" href="nah.htm#fnB36"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:7) <i>Heb </i>"he knows" or "he recognizes." The basic meaning of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">udy</FONT> is "to know," but it may denotes "to take care of someone" or "to protect" (<i>HALOT</i> 391; see Gen 39:6; Job 9:21; Ps 31:8). Most translations render it as "know" here (KJV, RSV, NASB, NIV, NKJV) but at least one recognizes the nuance "protect" (NRSV). It often refers to God protecting and caring for his people (2 Sam 7:20; Ps 144:3). When the subject is a king (suzerain) and the object is a servant (vassal), it often has covenantal overtones. In several ancient Near Eastern languages this term depicts the king (suzerain) recognizing his treaty obligation to protect and rescue his servant (vassal) from its enemies. For example, a letter from Abdi-Ashirta governor of Ammuru to the Egyptian king Amenophis III ends with a plea for protection from the raids of the Mittani: "May the king my lord <i>know</i> [= protect] me" (<i>yi</i>-<i>da</i>-<i>an</i>-<i>ni</i>) (EA 60:30-32). Similarly, in the treaty between Muwattallis and Alaksandus, the Hittite suzerain assures his vassal that in case he was attacked, "As he is an enemy of you, even so he is an enemy to the Sun; I the Sun, will <i>know</i> [= "protect"] only you, Alaksandus" (see H. B. Huffmon, "The Treaty Background of Hebrew YADA&#180;," <i>BASOR</i> 181 (1966): 31-37; idem, "A Further Note on the Treaty Background of Hebrew YADA&#180;," <i>BASOR</i> 184 (1966): 36-38.<br>

However, others connect it with the following line: "But with an overwhelming flood he will make a complete end of its [Nineveh's] site." Tsumura suggests that it does double duty and should be read both lines: "he knows those who trust him in an overwhelming flood, / but with an overwhelming flood he will make a complete end of its [Nineveh's] site." Connecting it with the preceding line creates a tight parallelism and a balanced 5+5 metrical count. Connecting it with the following line harmonizes with Nah 2:9 [8] that the walls of Nineveh were destroyed by flood waters and with historical evidence (Diodorus Siculus, <i>Bibliotheca Historica</i>, 2.27.1-3; Xenophon, <i>Anabasis</i>, 3.4.12) and modern archaeological evidence (A. T. Olmstead, <i>History of Assyria</i>, 637; C. J. Gadd, <i>The Fall of Nineveh</i>, 18). This might be an example of intentional ambiguity: God will protect his people from the very calamity that he will use to destroy his enemies. For further study, see D. T.

Likewise, Tsumura suggests emending the MT because the text, as it stands, does not have a clear parallel word for "his enemies" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wybyaw</FONT>) --emending the MT's <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Hm*oqm=</FONT> ("her place") to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wymwqm </FONT>("his adversaries") would result in a parallel word (D.

The Masoretic vocalization makes sense and should be retained.

 <a name="fn46" href="nah.htm#fnB46"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WlK=a%</FONT> ("they will be consumed") is an example of the old Qal passive perfect 3cpl which was erroneously pointed by the Masoretes as Pual perfect 3cpl.

 <a name="fn47" href="nah.htm#fnB47"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">du^</FONT> is taken as a comparative of degree ("like") by many lexicographers (BDB 724 [3]; <i>HALOT</i> 787 [5]), translations (NASB, NRSV, NJPS), and scholars (W.

Although the comparative sense is rare (1 Sam 11:15; 2 Sam 23:19; 2 Kgs 24:20; 1 Chr 4:27), it is suggested by the similes in v. 10 (see Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;312). The comparative sense is reflected in Symmachus, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJvmoivw" stoibh/' sumpeplegmevnn </FONT>("like an intertwined plant"); Aquilla, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">wJvsper speivrh sumpeplegmevnn</FONT> ("like a thorn-bush intertwined"); and Theodotion, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">wJ" ajvkanqai sumpeplegmevnai</FONT> ("like thorn-bushes intertwined"). Although Origen took <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">du^</FONT> in its more common spatial sense ("up to"), his approach can be dismissed because he misunderstood the entire line: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJvti eJvw" qemelivou aujtou' xerswqhvsetai</FONT> ("up to his foundation he shall be laid bare"). The KJV takes <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">du^</FONT> in its rare temporal sense ("while"; see BDB 725 [2]). Longman suggests a locative sense: "by the entangled thorns they are like drunkards stinking of drink" (T. Longman, "Nahum," in <i>The Minor Prophets</i>, ed. T. E. McComiskey, 2:794, 796; see Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;310). Because of its difficulty, several scholars have resorted to conjectural emendations of the MT: (1) K. J. Cathcart (<i>Nahum in the Light of Northwest Semitic</i>, 61) suggests emending the MT's <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">du^</FONT> to the temporal particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dou</FONT> ("again"); (2) The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest emending the MT's <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">du^ yK!</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ryu! yoh</FONT> ("woe to the city!") which appears in Nah 3:1; (3) The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest the alternate conjectural emendation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">k= Wru&amp;b=y] </FONT>("they will burn like ..."); (4) H. Junker (<i>Die zwolf kleinen Propheten</i>, 175) suggests emending <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">du^ yK!</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">du^y~K=</FONT> ("like a forest"). Although the Masoretic reading is difficult, it is more plausible than any conjectural emendation.<br>

Benoit, et al., <i>Discoveries in the Judaean Desert</i>, 2:197). The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yr]ys!</FONT> ("thorn-bushes") is from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rys!</FONT> ("thorn, thorn-bush," BDB 696; <i>HALOT</i> 752), e.g., Isa 34:13; Hos 2:8; Eccl 7:6. The Qal passive participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yk!b%s==</FONT> is from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ebs</FONT> ("to interweave," BDB 687; <i>HALOT</i> 740), e.g., Job 8:17, which is related to Assyrian <i>sabaku</i> "to entwine" (<i>AHw</i> 999.a) and Arabic <i>sabaka</i> "to entwine" (Leslau, 51). The MT is supported by several LXX translators, e.g., Symmachus (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">stoibh/ sumpeplegmevn</FONT>, "an intertwined plant"); Aquilla (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">speivrh sumpeplegmevnh</FONT>, "a thorn-bush intertwined"); and Theodotion (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajvkanqai sumpeplegmevnai</FONT>, "thorn-bushes intertwined"). It is also reflected in Vulgate's <i>spinarum perplexi</i> ("thorn-bushes entangled"). On the other hand, the Syriac Peshitta reflects <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yr]r+os &lt;yr]s*</FONT> ("your princes are rebels") which points to orthographic confusion and a different vocalization. Similar textual confusion is apparent in Origen: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qemelivou aujtou' xerswqhvsetai </FONT>("his foundation shall be laid bare") seems to reflect <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">sBk^y+ &lt;d&#180;s)y+</FONT> ("their foundation shall be washed away") which was caused by orthographic confusion and transposition of consonants. The MT should be retained.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:10)  This simile compares the imminent destruction of Nineveh to the burning of a mass of entangled thorn-bushes (Job 8:17). When thorn-bushes are entangled they burn quickly and completely ( Eccl 7:6; Isa 34:13).<br>

Cathcart revocalizes as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ya!b%s= &lt;ya!b=s)k=W</FONT> ("and like drunkards sodden with drink") (K. J. Cathcart, <i>Nahum in the Light of Northwest Semitic</i>, 61). Haldar equates Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">abs</FONT> with Ugaritic <i>sp'</i> ("eat") due to an interchange between <i>b</i> and <i>p</i>, and produces "and as they consume a consuming" (A. Haldar, <i>Studies in the Book of Nahum</i>, 32). Barr argues that the <i>mem</i> on MT <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;abksw</FONT> is enclitic, and he translates the line as "and as the drunken are getting drunk" (J. Barr, <i>Comparative Philology</i>, 33). <br>
 <b>tn</b> (1:10)  The MT's <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;a*b=s*k=W </FONT>is a noun with masculine plural suffix from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">abs</FONT> ("drink, liquor"), meaning "their drink, liquor" (e.g., Hos 4:18). This is supported by Symmachus ("their drink") and is reflected in the Syriac ("in their drink"). The Masoretic <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ya!Wbs= </FONT>is the passive participle from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">abs </FONT>("to drink," BDB 685 [a]). This produces "and like their liquor/drink being drunken." This makes good sense with the following line in which <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WlK=a% </FONT>("they will be consumed") appears. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WlK=a% </FONT>is frequently used in comparisons of consuming liquor and being consumed like chaff.<br>

 <b>tn </b> (1:10) Or "They will be fully consumed like dried stumble."

The adverbial sense is rare, appearing elsewhere only in Jer 12:6; thus, the adjectival sense is more probable. The Hebrew word order also suggests the adjectival sense because <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">al@m*</FONT> follows <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vb@y&#180; vq^K=</FONT> rather than <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WlK=a%</FONT>.<br>

 <a name="fn54" href="nah.htm#fnB54"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:12)  The syntax of this line is complicated and difficult to translate. The first clause is the concessive protasis of a real condition, while the second is the logical apodosis of a comparative clause.

The first use of the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/k@w+</FONT> ("Even though") introduces a concessive or conditional protasis of a present-time or immediate future-time real condition (A. B. Davidson, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 151, remark 1; Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;515; Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Hebrew Syntax,</i> &#167;38.2.d). The second use of the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/k@w+</FONT> ("so much more...") introduces the apodosis of a logical resultative clause (see Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Hebrew Syntax,</i> &#167;38.5.a).<br>
 <a name="fn55" href="nah.htm#fnB55"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:12) Or "are strong"; or "are at full strength"; or "are intact." Alternately, "Even though they have allies."

It can connote "full strength" or "full number" of an object (Gen 15:16; Deut 25:15; Prov 11:1; Amos 1:6, 9). Most commentators view this as a reference to the strength or numbers of the Assyrian army: "strong" (R. Smith, 77-78), "full strength" (NASB, NRSV) or "intact" (T. Longman, <i>Nahum</i>, 798). On the other hand, NIV follows the lead of Wiseman who points out that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ym!l@v=</FONT> can refer to military allies: "Even though they will have allies and so be all the more numerous" (D. J. Wiseman, "Is It Peace? Covenant and Diplomacy," <i>VT</i> 32 [1982]: 311-26). Nahum refers to the allies of the Assyrians elsewhere (Nah 3:15-17).<br>
 <a name="fn56" href="nah.htm#fnB56"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:12)  The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/k@w+</FONT> ("and moreover") functions as an emphatic comparative adverb of degree (BDB 486; Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Hebrew Syntax,</i> &#167;39.3.4.c; 4.e). It draws a comparison between <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ym!l@v=</FONT> ("strong") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yB!r~</FONT> ("many") but goes one step further for emphasis.

The complicated syntax of this line led to textual confusion and several textual variants among the versions.

Similarly, the Syriac reflects <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ybr &lt;ym ylvm la</FONT> ("to the rulers of many waters"). The MT is the most difficult reading and therefore best explains the origin of these textual variants. Moreover, the LXX of Nahum is well-known for its unusual mistranslations of the Hebrew text of Nahum. The LXX butchers v. 12 in several other places (see below).

 <a name="fn59" href="nah.htm#fnB59"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:12) <i>Heb</i> "they will be sheared." The term "cut off" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">zzG</FONT>) is ordinarily used to describe the literal actions of "shearing" sheep (Gen 31:19; 38:12-13; Deut 15:19; 18:4; 1 Sam 25:2, 4, 7, 11; 2 Sam 13:23-24; Job 31:20; Isa 53:7) and "cutting" hair (Jer 7:29; Mic 1:16; Job 1:20). It is used figuratively here to describe the destruction of the Assyrian army (BDB 159; <i>HALOT</i> 186).<br>
 <b>sn</b> ()  The expression <i>they will be cut off</i> is an example of a hypocatastasis (implied comparison); Nahum intentionally chose this term to compare the destruction of the Assyrians to the shearing of sheep. This word-play has great rhetorical impact because the Assyrians frequently used sheep imagery when boasting of the ease and brutality with which they defeated their enemies (see D. Marcus, "Animal Similes in Assyrian Royal Inscriptions," <i>Or</i> 46 <sup></sup>: 92-93). For example, Sennacherib brags, "I cut their throats like lambs" (D. D. Luckenbill, <i>Ancient Records of Assyria and Babylon</i>, 2:254). Likewise, Tiglath-pileser boasts, "I butchered their troops like sheep" (A. K. Grayson, <i>Assyrian Royal Inscriptions</i>, 2:25, 37). It is both appropriate (poetic justice) and ironic (reversal of situation) that the Assyrians themselves should suffer a fate which they boasted of inflicting upon others. They will be an easy, helpless prey for the Divine Warrior. Their punishment will fit their crimes.<br>
 <a name="fn60" href="nah.htm#fnB60"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:12)  In v. 12 the MT preserves a string of plural forms followed by a seemingly anomalous singular form: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rb*u*w+</FONT>...<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WZg{n&#180;</FONT>...<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yB!r~</FONT>...<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ym!l@v=</FONT> ("Even though they are numerous...they are many...they will be cut off...and he [?] will pass away"). Several other versions (LXX, Syr, Targum) read the plural form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WrbuW</FONT> ("and they will pass away"). Several scholars emend the MT to the plural form (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WrbuW</FONT>), noting that the next word (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Etnuw</FONT>) begins with <i>vav</i>; they suggest that the plural ending of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WrbuW</FONT> dropped out due to haplography or faulty word division (W. Rudolph, 159; J. J. M. Roberts, 47; T. Longman, 798). Another scholar retains the consonantal text, but repoints the form as an infinitive absolute: "They will be cut off, passing away" (K. J. Cathcart). On the other hand, more conservative scholars defend the MT reading and try to solve the problem by suggesting a shift from a plural referent (the Assyrians) to a singular referent (God or the Assyrian king): "They shall be cut down, when he passes through" (KJV) and "They will be cut off and he will pass over" (R. L. Smith, 77). Still others suggest that the singular form functions as a collective: "They will be cut off and [they] will pass away" (W. A. Maier, 206; C. F. Keil, 15). However, rather than resorting to textual emendations or performing syntactical improbabilities, the best solution may be simply to posit the presence of a rhetorical, stylistic device. The shift from these plural forms to the concluding singular form may be an example of heterosis of the plural to the singular (see Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 525 [4.5]). This is a common poetic device used for emphasis, especially at the climactic point in a speech (e.g., Gen 29:27; Num 22:6; 32:25; Job 12:7; 18:2; Esth 9:23; Ps 73:7; Prov 14:1, 9; John 3:11; 1 Tim 2:15).<br>
 <b>tn </b> (1:12) Or "pass away." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rbu</FONT> ("to pass through") is a key word in Nahum 1; it occurs three times (Nah 1:8, 12, 15 [2:1 HT]). This verb is often used in reference to water, both the raging onset of flood waters (Nah 1:8) and the passive trickling or dwindling away of receding waters (Job 6:15; 11:16).<br>
 <b>sn</b> ()  The phrase <i>trickle away</i> is an example of a hypocatastasis (implied comparison); Nahum compares the destruction of the mighty Assyrians with the trickling away of once high waters. This imagery has strong rhetorical impact because the Assyrians often boasted that they overwhelmed their enemies like a flood (see D. D. Luckenbill, <i>Ancient Records of Assyria and Babylon</i>, 2:32-33, 39, 68, 133, 151, 158, 253-54, 317, 328, 339, 345, 522, 561, 563, 587, 644, 651, 859, 865, 869, 906, 926). It is ironic then that they would soon dwindle away to a mere trickle! This is also an appropriate image in the light of the historical destruction of Nineveh through the use of flood waters, as predicted by the prophet (Nah 2:7-9) and recorded by ancient historians (Diodorus Siculus, <i>Bibliotheca Historica</i> 2.26-27; Xenophon, <i>Anabasis</i> 3.4.12; also see P. Haupt, "Xenophon's Account of the Fall of Nineveh," <i>JAOS</i> 28 <sup></sup>: 99-107).<br>

The threat of breaking an enemy's scepter was a common ancient Near Eastern treaty curse (see D. Hillers, <i>Treaty-Curses and the Old Testament Prophets</i>, 61). This proposed revocalization has no external support.

 <b>sn</b> (1:13)  The terms <i>yoke bar</i> and <i>shackles</i> are figures of speech (hypocatastasis) for Assyrian subjugation of Judah. The imagery of the yoke bar draws an implied comparison between the yoking of a beast of burden to the subjugation of a nation under a foreign power, i.e., vassaldom (Lev 26:13; Jer 27:2; 28:14; Ezek 30:18; 34:27). This imagery also alludes to the Assyrian use of "yoke" imagery to describe their subjugation of foreign nations to the status of vassal. When describing their subjugation of nations, Assyrian rulers frequently spoke of causing them to "pull my yoke" (D. D. Luckenbill, <i>Ancient Records of Assyria and Babylon</i>, 2:238-39, 308, 331, 347, 516-17, 662, 780, 786, 798, 833, 970). Sennacherib subjugated Judah to the Assyrian "yoke" in 701 B.C. when he invaded Judah and forced Hezekiah into a position of Assyrian vassal: "I laid waste the large district of Judah and put the straps of my yoke upon Hezekiah, its king" ("Sennacherib: The Siege of Jerusalem," lines 13-15, in J. B. Pritchard, ed., <i>Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament</i>, 3d ed., 288).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (1:13)  The statement <i>I will break Assyria's yoke bar from your neck</i> draws an implied comparison (hypocatastasis) between breaking a plowing yoke off the neck of a farming animal and freeing a vassal from the tyranny of an oppressive suzerain through military conquest (Lev 26:13; Isa 58:6; Jer 30:8; Ezek 30:18; 34:27).<br>
 <a name="fn66" href="nah.htm#fnB66"><sup>67</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:13)  The phrase <i>the shackles that are on you</i> draws an implied comparison between the chains and stocks of prisoners or slaves with the burden of international vassaldom to a tyrannical suzerain who demands absolute obedience and requires annual tributary offerings (e.g., Ps 2:3; Isa 52:2; Jer 27:2; 30:8). "Shackles" were the agent of covenantal discipline (e.g., Deut 28:48). Isaiah stated that the Assyrian "yoke" was the LORD's instrument of discipline (Isa 28:22). The phrase <i>I will tear apart the shackles that are on you</i> draws an implied comparison (hypocatastasis) between removing the iron chains from a prisoner/slave and freeing a vassal from the oppression of a tyrannical suzerain through military conquest (Ps 2:3; Isa 52:2).<br>

The referent of the 2ms suffix ("you") probably refers to the Assyrian king rather than to the personified city of Nineveh (so NIV). Elsewhere in the Book of Nahum, the city of Nineveh is referred to by the feminine rather than masculine gender.

 <a name="fn70" href="nah.htm#fnB70"><sup>71</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:14)  The MT reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;r\b=q! &lt;yc!a*</FONT> ("I will make your grave") is usually understood as a figure of speech (metonymy of effect) meaning that the LORD will destroy/execute the Assyrian king. On the other hand, the Targum and Syriac treat this as a double-accusative construction--the implied second object of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yc!a*</FONT> being <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">y;h#Oa$ tyB@</FONT> ("the house [i.e., "temple"] of your gods"): "I will make it [the house (i.e., temple) of your gods] your grave." Cathcart suggests revocalizing the MT <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yc!a* </FONT>to a Hiphil imperfect <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;y]v!a*</FONT> from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;mv</FONT> ("to devastate"): "I will devastate your grave." Cathcart notes that the destruction of one's grave, like the threat of no burial, was a common ancient Near Eastern treaty-curse: "Tombs, especially royal tombs, were often protected by curses directed against persons who might violate and desecrate them, and the very curse kings used to have inscribed on their tombs were precisely the curse of no progeny and no resting-place" (K. J. Cathcart, "Treaty-Curses and the Book of Nahum," <i>CBQ</i> 35 [1973]: 180-81). This might reflect the background of the ancient Near Eastern <i>kudurru</i> curses which were made against those who might devastate a royal grave and which were put into effect by the gods of the king (see F. C. Fensham, "Common Trends in Curses of the Near Eastern Treaties and Kudurru-Inscriptions Compared with Maledictions of Amos and Isaiah," <i>ZAW</i> 75 [1963]: 157-59). Despite the fact the king's grave was allegedly protected by the Assyrian gods, the LORD would nevertheless successfully destroy it, and it would be the Assyrian king who would receive the curse. This approach respects the traditional consonantal text and only involves the revocalization of the MT's <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">c</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">v</FONT>.<br>

In this case, the perfect tense does not denote past-time action, but a future-time action that is pictured as complete (certain) and independent (not contingent upon other factors).

Maier (<i>The Book of Nahum</i>, 232) contends that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bv*</FONT> is derived from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bb^v*</FONT> I ("to cut off; to destroy; to smite") which is related to Arabic <i>sabba</i> ("to cut"), Aramaic <FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">sibba&aacute;</FONT> ("splinter"), and New Hebrew.

There are several problems with Maier's proposal. First, his support from Arabic, Aramaic (Targum) and New Hebrew is all late. Second, it creates a <i>hapax</i> <i>legomenon</i> (a word that occurs only once in the Hebrew Bible) for a well-known Hebrew word which frequently appears in climactic contexts in prophetic speeches, as here. Third, the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv</FONT> ("to turn; to return; to restore") makes perfectly good sense in this context. The meaning of this usage of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bv*</FONT> (from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv</FONT>) is debated. The LXX took it in the negative sense "has turned aside." On the other hand, it is nuanced in a positive, salvific sense by the Vulgate, Targum, and Syriac. The salvific nuance is best for the following reasons: (1) its direct object is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/oaG+</FONT> which should be understood in the positive sense of "majesty; exaltation; glory" (see following note on the word "majesty"); (2) the motive clause introduced by causative/explanatory <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> ("for") would make little sense, saying that the reason the LORD was about to destroy Nineveh was because he had turned away the pride of Judah; however, it makes good sense to say that the LORD would destroy Nineveh because he was about to deliver Judah; and (3) a reference to the LORD turning aside from Judah would be out of harmony with the rest of the book.<br>

 <b>tn</b> (2:3)  The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;D&#180;a*m=</FONT> ("reddened") from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;da</FONT> II ("red") refers to clothes made red with dye (Exod. 25:6; 26:14; 35:7, 23; 36:13; 39:34) or made red from bloodshed (Isa 63:2). The parallelism between <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;D&#180;a*m=</FONT> ("reddened") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yu!L*t%m=</FONT> ("clad in scarlet colored clothing") suggests that the shields were dyed prior to battle, like the scarlet dyed uniforms. Nah 2:1-10 unfolds the assault in chronological sequence; thus, the spattering of blood on the warrior's shields would be too early in the account (R. D. Patterson, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah</i>, 65).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:3)  As psychological warfare, warriors often wore uniforms colored blood-red, to strike fear into the hearts of their enemy (see Xenophon, <i>Cyropaedia</i> 6.4.1; J. Freeman, <i>Manners and Customs of the Bible</i>, 324; Ezek 23:5-6).<br>

The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest emending the MT's <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">todl*P=</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dodp!l^</FONT> ("torches") to create the simile <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dodP!l^ vaK=</FONT> ("like torches of fire" or "like flaming torches") which is reflected in the Syriac Peshitta and Symmachus (so KJV, RSV, NJPS). The problem with this is that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dpl</FONT> ("torch") is masculine in gender, so the plural form is not <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">todpl</FONT> but <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ydpl</FONT>--which appears in Nah 2:4 (BDB 542; <i>HALOT</i> 533). Others propose a complete reversal of the consonants to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twpld</FONT> from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[lD</FONT> ("to drip; to trickle; to leak; to weep") and translate <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twpld vak</FONT> as "like flickering fire" (NEB). Against this proposal is the fact that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[lD</FONT> is usually used in reference to water, but it is never used in reference to fire (<i>HALOT</i> 223; BDB 196).<br>
 <b>tn </b> (2:3) <i>Heb </i>"the steel." The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">todl*P=</FONT> is a <i>hapax</i> <i>legomenon</i>. The corresponding noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dlP</FONT> probably means "metal, steel" (BDB 811; <i>HALOT</i> 761), and it is probably related to Arabic <i>puladu</i> ("steel"), Syriac <FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">pld&aacute;</FONT> ("steel"), and early Persian <i>fulad</i> ("steel"). This rendering is followed by NIV, NASB, NRSV. The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">todl*P=</FONT> ("steel") probably refers to the metallic pole attachments for the chariot spears, the side armor of the chariots, or the steel scythes fastened to the axle of a chariot (J. Freeman, <i>Manners and Customs of the Bible</i>, 325). Xenophon described the army of Cyrus in a similar manner; the side armor of the chariots and the breastplates and thigh-pieces of the chariot-horses were "flashing with bronze" (Xenophon, <i>Cyropaedia</i> 6.4.1). On the other hand, Cathcart connects Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dlP</FONT> to Ugaritic <i>paladu</i> "a garment made of linen hair" (see C. Gordon, <i>Ugaritic Glossary</i>, 2045), and suggests that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bk#r\h* todl*P= </FONT>refers to the coverings, blankets, or caparisons of chariot horses (K. J. Cathcart, <i>Nahum in the Light of Northwest Semitic</i>, 88). This demands that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bk#r\h*</FONT> be nuanced "chariot horses"--a problem when it means "chariots" in Nah 2:4; 3:2.<br>
 <a name="fn99" href="nah.htm#fnB99"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:3)  The collective singular <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bk#r\ </FONT>("chariot") refers to all of the chariots in the army as a whole: "chariots; chariotry" (BDB 939 [1]; <i>HALOT</i> 891 [1]). The singular form rarely refers to a single chariot (BDB 939 [2]; <i>HALOT</i> 891 [3]). The collective use is indicated by the plural verb "they race back and forth" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wll=oht=y]</FONT>) in v. 5 (GKC &#167;145.<i>b</i>). The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bk#r\</FONT> usually refers to war chariots (Exod 14:7; Josh 11:4; 17:16, 18; 24:6; Judg 1:19; 4:3, 7, 13; 5:28; 1 Sam 13:5; 2 Sam 1:6; 8:4; 10:18; 1 Kgs 9:19, 22; 10:26; Jer 47:3; 50:37; 51:21; Ezek 23:24; Nah 2:3, 4, 13).<br>
 <a name="fn100" href="nah.htm#fnB100"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tc</b> (2:3)  The MT reads the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B=</FONT> ("are [like]"), but several Hebrew MSS read the comparative preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">K=</FONT> ("like"). This textual variant probably arose due to the visual similarity of the two letters (orthographic confusion) and the relatively rare use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B=</FONT> in metaphors--the comparative preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">K=</FONT> ("like") is much more common in metaphors. The MT is the more difficult reading and best explains the origin of the variant.<br>
 <b>tn </b> (1:2) <i>Heb </i>"The chariots are..." The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B=</FONT> on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">va@B=</FONT> denotes essence: "The chariots are..." (GKC &#167;133.<i>c</i>; <i>HALOT</i> 104 <sup>3</sup>). The use of this preposition creates a metaphor, comparing the steel fittings of the chariots to flashes of fire.<br>

 <a name="fn102" href="nah.htm#fnB102"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:3) <i>Heb </i>"on the day of its preparation." The Hiphil infinitive construct <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">onyk!h&amp;</FONT> (from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/WK</FONT>) means "to prepare; to make ready" (<i>HALOT</i> 465; BDB 466). The Hiphil verb is used of preparing weapons and military equipment for the day of battle (2 Chr 26:14; Ps 7:14; 57:7). The 3ms suffix ("<i>its</i> preparation") is a collective singular, referring to the chariotry as a whole.<br>

However, it is preferable to retain the MT for the noun, with the verb given its normal Hebrew meaning.<br>
 <b>tn </b> (2:3) <i>Heb </i>"the spears quiver"; or "the spears are made to quiver."<b> </b>Alternately, "the horses quiver" or "the horses shake [with excitement]." The Hophal perfect <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wlurh</FONT> ("are made to quiver") is from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lur</FONT> ("to quiver; to shake") which appears elsewhere only in Hab 2:16 (BDB 497; <i>HALOT</i> 900); the related noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lur </FONT>("reeling") appears only once (Zech 12:2). This Hebrew root is related to the Aramaic <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lur</FONT> ("to quiver; to shake"). The action of the spear-shafts quivering is metonymical (effect for cause) to the action of the spear-shafts being brandished by the warriors. In the translation the words "the soldiers" are supplied for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn104" href="nah.htm#fnB104"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tc</b> (2:3)  The MT reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yv!r)B=h^</FONT> ("the cypresses"). A variant textual tradition (preserved in several Hebrew MSS) reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yv!r)P=h^</FONT> ("spears, horses, horsemen") which is reflected in the LXX and Syriac. The variant noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yv!r)B=h^</FONT> is derived either from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vrP</FONT> IV ("horse; horseman"; see BDB 831; <i>HALOT</i> 783) or <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vrP </FONT>II ("spear; staff") which is related to Akkadian <i>parussu</i> ("spear-staff"; see BDB 831). The LXX connects <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yv!r)B=h^</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vrP</FONT> IV ("horsemen") as indicated by its translation <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oiJ iJppei&gt;"</FONT> ("the horsemen").

 <b>tn </b> (2:3) <i>Heb </i>"the cypresses"; alternately, "the horses." The Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yv!r)B=h^</FONT> ("the cypresses") is probably from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vorB</FONT> ("cypress; fir") and is a figure of speech (synecdoche of material) in which the thing made (spear-shafts) is intended by the use of term for the material out of which it is made (cypress wood).

 <a name="fn105" href="nah.htm#fnB105"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:4) <i>Heb </i>"the chariot." The Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bk#r\h*</FONT> ("the chariot") is a collective use of the singular, as indicated by the plural verb "[they] race madly" (see GKC &#167;145.<i>b</i>).<br>

When used in military contexts, it describes the wild, furious action of war-chariots charging forward to attack the enemy (Jer 46:9). The Hitpolel stem is the equivalent to the Hitpael stem for geminate verbs (see Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Hebrew Syntax,</i> &#167;26 [1.1.c]). The Hitpolel stem expresses energetic, intense, and rapid action; it gives special energy and movement to the verbal idea (J.

Most English translations render this usage as "torches" (KJV, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NJPS). However, the parallelism with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yqrBK </FONT>("like lightning flashes") suggests that in this context <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;dyPLK</FONT> may be nuanced "like lightning bolts."<br>
 <a name="fn110" href="nah.htm#fnB110"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:4) Or "they flash here and there." The Polel imperfect <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wxxory</FONT> ("they dash here and there") is from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">JWr</FONT> which means "to run quickly" in reference to men (Gen 18:2; 2 Kgs 23:12; Prov 4:12) and "to gallop" in reference to horsemen (Joel 2:14). The Hiphil stem denotes "to drive off with haste" (Jer 49:19; 50:44). The Polel stem, which is used here, means "to race about swiftly; to flash by speedily; to run to and fro" (<i>HALOT</i> 882; BDB 930).<br>
 <a name="fn111" href="nah.htm#fnB111"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:4) Or simply, "like lightning." The term "lightning flash" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qrB</FONT>) is often used to compare the brightness of an object to the flash of lightning: the glory of Yahweh (Ezek 1:13), the splendor of an angel (Dan 10:6), the glitter of swords (Deut 32:41; Ezek 21:15; Nah 3:3; Hab 3:11), and the gleam of arrowheads (Job 20:25). It is also used as a figure (hypocatastasis) for speed, such as the swift destruction of an enemy (Zech 9:14). Perhaps both images are suggested here: the bright glitter of the chariots ( v. 4b) and the speed of the chariots as suggested by the verb "they dash here and there" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wxxory</FONT>, v. 5b).<br>

The rarity of this homonymic root in Hebrew has led to textual variants and several proposed emendations.

 <b>tn</b> (2:5)  The Hebrew verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rK^z&#180;</FONT> II is related to Akkadian <i>zakartu</i> "to give an order" (<i>CAD </i>2:17). This is distinct from the more common root <i>zakar</i> I ("to remember") which is related to Akkadian <i>zakaru</i>. The translations are split between the two roots: "he commands" (NJPS) and "he summons" (NIV) versus "he recounts" (KJV), "he remembers" (NASB), and "he calls" (NRSV).<br>

G. R. Driver argues that the MT makes little sense in the portrayal of a successful assault; the motif of stumbling warriors usually connotes defeat (Isa 5:27; Jer. 46:6). Driver argues that MT's <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wlv=K*y]</FONT> ("they stumble") arose from metathesis (reversal of consonants) from an original <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wkl=V*y]</FONT> (Niphal from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Elv "</FONT>to cast forth") which also appears in 2 Kgs 13:24-25, 28 ("hurled himself," i.e., rushed headlong). Driver suggests that this is related to Arabic <i>salaka</i> VII ("to rush in"). He notes that the emendation would produce a tighter parallelism with the following noun: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wrh&amp;m^y+</FONT> ("they hasten"). See G. R. Driver,<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> "</FONT>Linguistic and Textual Problems: Minor Prophets II," <i>JTS</i> 39 (1938): 270. On the other hand, Armerding argues that the anomalous MT reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wlv=K*y]</FONT> ("they stumble") can be explained without recourse to textual emendation. The stumbling of the attacking army is caused, not by their weakness, but by the corpses of the Assyrians strewn in their path which obstructs their advance. Armerding suggests that this motif is suggested in Nah 3:3 (C. E. Armerding,<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> "</FONT>Nahum," in <i>Expositor's Bible Commentary</i> 7:475).<br>

The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkylh</FONT> ("procession; journey") is nuanced "march; advance" in a military context (BDB 237 [1.a]; <i>HALOT</i> 246 [1.a]). Similarly, the related verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Elh</FONT> means "to march; to advance" in battle contexts (Judg 1:10; Hab 1:6). This is related to the Assyrian noun <i>alaktu</i> ("to advance") which is often used of military advances (<i>CAD</i> 1.1.299), e.g., "you will always know of the movements (<i>al</i>-<i>ka</i>-<i>ka</i>-<i>at</i>) of your enemy" (YOS 10 46 2:20); "you will destroy the expeditionary force of the enemy, the advance (<i>a</i>-<i>lak</i>-<i>ti</i>) of the enemy will not [succeed]" (<i>CT</i> 20 49:9); "the advance (<i>a</i>-<i>la</i>-<i>ak</i>-<i>ti</i>) of the enemy will not succeed" (<i>KAR</i> 454:12). The related Assyrian noun <i>aliktu</i> means "detachment of soldiers" (<i>CAD</i> 1.1.346). <i>HALOT</i> suggests that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkylh</FONT> is related to an Assyrian noun which is a technical military term: "trenches; columns" (<i>HALOT</i> 246).

The directive sense is seen in the LXX <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejpiV taV teivxh aujth'"</FONT> ("to her wall"). Although the MT lacks the directive -<i>he</i> ending, it is possible that the MT's <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ht*m*oh </FONT>functions as an adverbial accusative of direction meaning "<i>to</i> her wall."

The Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Eks</FONT> ("mantelet") is a military technical term referring to a large movable shelter used as a protective cover for soldiers besieging a fortified city, designed to shield them from the arrows shot down from the city wall (<i>HALOT</i> 754; BDB 697). This noun is a <i>hapax</i> <i>legomenon</i> (a word that only occurs once in the Hebrew Bible) and is derived from the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Eks</FONT> III ("to cover; to protect"; <i>TWOT</i> 2:623-24). K. J. Cathcart  (<i>Nahum in the Light of Northwest Semitic</i>, 95) suggests that the translation "mantelet" is supported by the use of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Eks</FONT> III in Ps 140:7 [8]: "Yahweh, my Lord, my fortress of safety; shelter (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hT*K)s^</FONT>) my head in the day of arms." This is reflected in several recent translations: "wheeled shelters" (NJPS), "protective shield" (NIV), "covering used in a siege" (NASB margin), and "mantelet" (NRSV).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:5)  The Hebrew term translated <i>covered siege tower</i> probably does not refer to a battering ram, but to a movable protective tower, used to cover the soldiers and the siege machinery. These are frequently depicted in Neo-Assyrian bas-reliefs, such as the relief of Sennacherib's siege of Lachish. The Neo-Assyrians used both small, hut-like shelters that could be carried by a few men, as well as larger, tower-like structures rolled on wheels to the top of siege embankments. These mantelets protected the attackers while they build the embankments and undermined the foundations of the city walls to hasten their collapse. Siege towers were equipped with machines designed to hurl stones to smash the fortifications and firebrands to start conflagrations (see A. H. Layard, <i>Nineveh and Its Remains</i>, 2:281-86).<br>
 <a name="fn119" href="nah.htm#fnB119"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:6) Or "river dam gates." <br>
 <b>sn</b> ()  Nineveh employed a system of dams and <i>sluice gates</i> to control the waters of the Tebiltu and Khoser Rivers which flowed through the city (R. C. Thompson and R. W. Hutchinson, <i>A Century of Exploration at Nineveh</i>, 120-132). However, the Tebiltu often flooded its banks inside the city, undermining palace foundations and weakening other structures. To reduce this flooding, Sennacherib changed the course of the Tebiltu inside the city. Outside the city, he dammed up the Khoser and created a reservoir, regulating the flow of water into the city through an elaborate system of double sluice gates (D. D. Luckenbill, <i>Ancient Records of Assyria and Babylon</i>, 99-100; J. Reade, "Studies in Assyrian Geography, Part I: Sennacherib and the Waters of Nineveh," <i>RA</i> 72 <sup></sup>: 47-72; idem, "Studies in Assyrian Geography, Part II: The Northern Canal System," <i>RA</i> 72 [1978]: 157-80). According to classical tradition (Diodorus and Xenophon), just before Nineveh fell, a succession of very high rainfalls deluged the area. The Khoser River swelled and the reservoir was breached. The waters rushed through the overloaded canal system, breaking a hole twenty stadia (about 2.3 miles or 3.7 km) wide in the city wall and flooding the city. When the waters receded, the Babylonians stormed into Nineveh and conquered the city (Diodorus Siculus, <i>Bibliotheca Historica</i>, 2.26-27, especially 27.1-3; Xenophon, <i>Anabasis</i>, 3.4.12; P. Haupt, "Xenophon's Account of the Fall of Nineveh," <i>JAOS</i> 28 [1907]: 65-83). This scenario seems to be corroborated by the archaeological evidence (A. T. Olmstead, <i>History of Assyria</i>, 637; C. J. Gadd, <i>The Fall of Nineveh</i>, 18).<br>
 <a name="fn120" href="nah.htm#fnB120"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:6) <i>Heb "</i>and the palace melts." The Niphal perfect <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gomn&#180;</FONT> ("is undulated") from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gWm </FONT>("to melt; to soften; to dissolve") is sometimes used of material objects (earth, hills) being softened or eroded by water (Ps 65:11; Amos 9:13). Nahum pictures the river banks inside Nineveh overflowing in a torrent, crashing into the royal palace and eroding its limestone slab foundations.<br>
 <b>sn</b> ()  Ironically, a few decades earlier, Sennacherib engaged in a program of flood control because the Tebiltu River often flooded its banks inside Nineveh and undermined the palace foundations. Sennacherib also had to strengthen the foundations of his palace with "mighty slabs of limestone" so that "its foundation would not be weakened by the flood of high water" (D. D. Luckenbill, <i>Ancient Records of Assyria and Babylon</i>, 99-100). At the time of the fall of Nineveh, the Palace of Ashurbanipal was located on the edge of the sharpest bend of the Khoser River as it flowed through the city; when the Khoser overflowed its banks, the palace foundation was weakened (J. Reade, "Studies in Assyrian Geography, Part I: Sennacherib and the Waters of Nineveh," <i>RA</i> 72 <sup></sup>: 51).<br>

The Hophal perfect 3ms <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bX^h%w+</FONT> is from either <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bxn</FONT> I ("to stand," <i>HALOT</i> 715; BDB 662) or <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bxn </FONT>II ("to dissolve, weaken," <i>HALOT</i> 715). Many scholars who take <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bX^h%w+</FONT> from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bxn</FONT> I ("to stand") suggest that the meaning is "it is fixed; it is determined (?)" (BDB 662). This is followed by several English translations: "it is decreed" (NIV, NRSV) and "it is fixed" (NASB). This is a rather awkward idea and does not seem to fit the context of the description of the destruction of the palace or the exile of the Ninevites. On the other hand, several scholars suggest that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bX^h%w+</FONT> is derived from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bxn</FONT> II ("to be weak"; cf. Ps 39:6; Zech 11:16; <i>HALOT</i> 715) which is related to Arabic <i>nasiba</i> ("to be weak") or Arabic <i>nasaba</i> ("to suck out; to dissolve") and Assyrian <i>nasabu</i> ("to suck out"); see W. H. F. Saggs, "Nahum and the Fall of Nineveh," <i>JTS</i> 20 (1969): 220-21; R. D. Patterson, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah</i>, 69-70. As a parallel word to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gomn&#180;</FONT> ("is deluged" or "melts"), <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bX^h%w+</FONT> ("is weakened" or "is dissolved") describes the destructive effect of the flood waters on the limestone foundations of the palace. The verse divisions in the MT place <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bX^h%w+</FONT> at the beginning of v. 7 ET [v. 8 HT]; however, it probably should be placed at the end of v. 6 ET [v. 7 HT] and connected with the last two words of the line: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bX^h%w+ gomn&#180; lk*yh@h^w+</FONT> ("the palace is deluged and dissolved"; see R. D. Patterson, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah</i>, 69-70). This is supported by several factors: (1) the gender of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bX^h%w+</FONT> is masculine, while the verbs in v. 7 are feminine: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ht***l*u&amp;&amp;h) ht*L=G% </FONT>("she is led into exile and taken away"); (2) the gender of the final verb in v. 6 is masculine: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gomn&#180;</FONT> ("[the palace] is deluged"); (3) both <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bX^h%w+</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gomn&#180;</FONT> are passive verbs (Niphal and Hophal); (4) both <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gomn&#180;</FONT> ("is deluged") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bX^h%w+</FONT> ("is dissolved/weakened") are parallel in meaning, describing the effects of flood waters on the limestone foundation of the royal palace; (5) this redivision of the lines produces a balanced 3+3 and 2+2 colon count in these two lines; and (6) this produces a balance of two verbs each in each colon. The meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bX^h%w+</FONT> is notoriously difficult (for a list of options, see <i>Hebrew Bible Text Project</i>, 5:343-45). Scholars offer over a dozen different proposals but only the most important are summarized here: (1) Most scholars take <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bX^h%w+</FONT> as Hophal perfect 3ms with <i>vav</i>-conjunction from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bxn</FONT> I ("to stand"), meaning "it is fixed; it is determined (?)" (BDB 662). This is followed by several English translations: "it is decreed" (NIV, NRSV) and "it is fixed" (NASB). The LXX translation <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiV hJ uJpovstasi"</FONT> ("and the foundation") reflects a reading of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bX^h%w+ </FONT>with a meaning similar to its use in Gen 28:12 ("a stairway resting on the earth") or a reading of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bX*M^h^w+</FONT> from the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bX*m^</FONT> ("place of standing"; cf. BDB 662; <i>HALOT</i> 620). (2) The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest emending to Hophal perfect 3fs <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ha*x=h%w+</FONT> from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">axy</FONT> ("to go out"), meaning "she is led out into exile" or "she is led out to be executed" (<i>HALOT</i> 427; see, e.g., Gen 38:25; Jer 38:22; Ezek 14:22; 38:8; 44:5; Amos 4:3). (3) Early Jewish interpreters (Targum Jonathan, Kimchi, Rashi) and modern Christian interpreters (e.g., W. A. Maier, <i>The Book of Nahum</i>, 259-62) view <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bX^h%w+</FONT> as the proper name of an Assyrian queen, "Huzzab." This is adopted by several translations: "And Huzzab is exiled" (KJV, AV, RV, NJPS). However, this view has been severely criticized by several scholars because no queen in Assyrian history is known by this name (G. R. Driver, "Farewell to Queen Huzzab!" <i>JTS</i> 16 [1965]: 296-98; W. H. F. Saggs, "Nahum and the Fall of Nineveh," <i>JTS</i> 20 [1969]: 220). (4) Several scholars suggest that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bX^h%w+</FONT> is the Hophal perfect of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bxn</FONT> II which is related to Assyrian <i>nasabu</i> ("to suck out") and Arabic <i>nasaba</i> ("to suck out; to dissolve," Lane 2805), as in Ps 39:6 and Zech 11:16. Taking <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ht*L=G%</FONT> as the noun "column-base" (see translator's note on the word "exile" in this verse), Saggs translates the line as: "its column-base is dissolved" (W. H. F. Saggs, "Nahum and the Fall of Nineveh," <i>JTS</i> 20 [1969]: 220-21). Patterson connects it to the last two words of the previous line: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bX^h%w+ gomn&#180; lk*yh@h^w+</FONT> "The palace collapses and crumbles" (R. D. Patterson, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah</i>, 69-70). (5) Driver revocalizes it as the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bX)h^w+</FONT> ("and the [captive] train") which he relates to the Arabic noun <i>sub</i> ("train"): "the train of captives goes into exile" (so NEB). This is reflected in the Greek text of the Minor Prophets from Nahal Heber which took<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> bxhw</FONT> as "wagon; chariot." (6) Cathcart suggests that the MT's <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bX^h%w+</FONT> may be repointed as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bX^h^w+ </FONT>which is related to Assyrian <i>hassabu</i> ("goddess"). (7) Several scholars emend to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yb!X=h^w+</FONT> ("the Beauty") from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yb!x=</FONT> ("beauty") and take this as a reference to the statue of Ishtar in Nineveh (K. J. Cathcart, <i>Nahum in the Light of Northwest Semitics</i>, 96-98; M. Delcor, "Allusions a la deesse Istar en Nahum 2,8?" <i>Bib</i> 58 [1977]: 73-83; T. E. McComiskey, <i>The Minor Prophets</i>, 2:806). (8) Smith derives consonantal <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bxhw</FONT> from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">byx!n+</FONT> ("pillar," <i>HALOT</i> 716-17) which is related to Assyrian <i>nisibi</i> which refers to the statue of a goddess (R.

There are two basic views of the meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ht*L=G% </FONT>in this verse: (1) "She is stripped" (see R. L. Smith, <i>Micah-Malachi</i>, 81). This may describe the exposure of the foundation of a building (Ezek 13:14) or the uncovering of intimate parts of the body (Exod 20:26; Isa 47:3; Ezek 16:36, 57; 23:29; BDB 163; <i>HALOT</i> 192). This is reflected in the LXX reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajpekaluvfqh</FONT> ("she has been exposed"). This approach is followed by NASB ("she is stripped"). (2) "She is taken into exile" (KJV, NIV, NRSV, NJPS). The Qal stem of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlg</FONT> often means "to go into exile" (Judg 18:30; 2 Kgs 24:14; Isa 5:13; 49:21; Jer 1:3; Ezek 39:23; Amos 1:5; 5:5; 6:7; Lam 1:3); the Hiphil often means "to deport exiles" (2 Kgs 15:20; 16:9; 17:6, 11, 26, 28, 33; 18:11; 24:14-15; 25:11; Jer 20:4; 22:12; 24:1; 27:20; 29:1, 4, 7, 14; 39:9; 43:3; 52:15, 28, 30; Ezek 39:28; Amos 1:6; 5:27; Lam 4:22; Esth 2:6; Ezra 2:1; Neh 7:6; 1 Chr 5:6, 26, 41; 8:6; 2 Chr 36:20); and the Hophal stem always means "to be deported; to be taken into exile" (Jer 40:1, 7; Esth 2:6; 1 Chr 9:1). This makes the best sense in the light of the parallel verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">htluh </FONT>("she is led away") in v. 7 [8 HT] and the description of the fleeing Ninevites in v. 8 [9 HT]. The <i>BHS</i> editors and <i>HALOT</i> 191 suggest that consonantal <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">htlg</FONT> be vocalized as Qal perfect 3fs <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ht*l=G&#180;</FONT> ("she goes into exile") from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlg </FONT>(Qal: "go into exile"). Patterson suggests vocalizing consonantal <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">htlg</FONT> as the noun with 3fs suffix <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ht*l=G&#180;</FONT> for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ht*l=oG</FONT> ("her exiles/captives") and taking the singular form as collective in meaning: "her exiles/captives are carried away" (R. D. Patterson, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah</i>, 70). Saggs suggests that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">htlg</FONT> is the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ht*L*G|</FONT> ("column-base") as in 1 Kgs 7:41-42; 2 Chr 4:12-13 (BDB 165 [2.b]; <i>HALOT</i> 192 [1.b]) which is related to Assyrian <i>gullatu</i> "column-base" (<i>CAD</i> 5:128). He renders the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">htlg bxhw</FONT> as "its column-base[s] is/are dissolved" (see above). He suggests that this provides an excellent parallel to "the palace begins to melt" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gomn&#180; lk*yh@h^w+</FONT>). Saggs also proposes that the LXX reflects this picture: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiV hJ uJpostasi" ajpekaluvfqh </FONT>("and the palace-foundation has been exposed") See W. H. F. Saggs, "Nahum and the Fall of Nineveh," <i>JTS</i> 20 (1969): 220-25.<br>

The MT reads the Hophal perfect 3fs <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ht*l*u&amp;h)</FONT> ("she is carried away") from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlu </FONT>("to go up"). The Hiphil stem of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlu</FONT> often describes a military commander leading a group of forced workers out of a town (1 Kgs 5:27; 9:15, 21; 2 Chr 8:8); likewise, the Hophal stem may denote "to be led away into exile" (<i>HALOT</i> 830; BDB 748).<br>

This root is related to Assyrian <i>nagagu</i> "to cry" (<i>AHw</i> 709.b). This harmonizes well with the following cola: "Her maidservants moan like doves, they beat upon their breasts." This is adopted by several English translations (NASB, NIV, NRSV). On the other hand, an alternate vocalization tradition (represented by several Hebrew MSS, Targum Jonathan, LXX, and Vulgate) reads the Pual participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">togh&amp;n{m=</FONT> ("forcibly removed") from the more common root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ghn </FONT>I ("to drive away; to lead away"; <i>HALOT</i> 675). This root is often used of conquerors leading away exiles or prisoners of war (Gen 31:26; Deut 4:27; 28:37; Isa 20:4; Lam 3:2). This picture is clearly seen in the LXX reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiV aiJ dou'lai aujth'" hjvgonto </FONT>("and her maidservants were led away"). This textual tradition harmonizes with the imagery of exile in the preceding colon (see translator's note on the word "exile" in this verse).

Elsewhere it is used of beating timbrels (Ps 68:26; 1 Sam 21:14 cj). The participle describes a circumstance accompanying the main action ("her maidservants moan") and functions in a continual, repetitive manner (see Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Hebrew Syntax,</i> &#167;37 [6.d]; Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;221).<br>

 <b>tn </b> (1:3) <i>Heb </i>"upon their heart." The term "their heart" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/hbbl</FONT>) is a figure of speech (synecdoche of the inner organ for the outer body part) representing their breasts/chests (e.g., Dan 4:16 <sup>13</sup>; see <i>HALOT</i> 516; BDB 523 [1]). The singular noun is used collectively for all the maidservants as a whole, as the plural suffix indicates (see Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Hebrew Syntax,</i> &#167;7 [2.1.b]; Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;2).<br>
 <a name="fn129" href="nah.htm#fnB129"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:8)  The term "pool" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkrb</FONT> II) usually refers to a man-made artificial water reservoir fed by water aqueducts rather than to a natural pond (<i>HALOT</i> 161). For example, it is used in reference to man-made water reservoirs for the royal gardens (Eccl 2:6; Neh 2:14); man-made water reservoirs in Jerusalem, some of which were fed by aqueducts (2 Kgs 18:17; 20:20; Isa 7:3; 22:9, 11; 36:2; Neh 3:15, 16); the pool of Gibeon (2 Sam 2:13); the pool of Hebron (2 Sam 4:12); the pool of Samaria (1 Kgs 22:38); and the pools of Heshbon (Song 7:5).

The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m!</FONT> is used temporally, marking the beginning of a continuous period ("since, from"; see <i>HALOT</i> 597 [2]; BDB 581 [4.a]). Several scholars suggest that the third-person independent pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ayh</FONT> functions as a possessive genitive ("her"), a usage attested in Ugaritic, Akkadian, and elsewhere in Hebrew (2 Kgs 9:18; Isa 18:2; Nah 2:12). See K. J. Cathcart, <i>Nahum in the Light of Northwest Semitic</i>, 100-101; Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Hebrew Syntax,</i> &#167;16 (2.a) and n. 9; T. E. McComiskey, ed. <i>The Minor Prophets</i>, 2:807. The plural of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;oy</FONT> ("day") here denotes "lifetime" (<i>HALOT</i> 400 [6.c]). The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ayh ymym</FONT> probably means "from the beginning of her days" or "throughout her days" or "during her lifetime." This is similar to "from the beginning of your days" or "since your days began" or "as long as you live" (1 Sam 25:28; Job 38:12; see <i>HALOT</i> 400 [6.c]; 597 [2.a]; BDB 581 [4a]). Several translations adopt this: "throughout her days" (NASB), "from earliest times" (NJPS), and "[Nineveh] of old" (KJV). In contrast to the Masoretic vocalization, the consonantal text <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ayh ymym</FONT> is rendered "her waters" by the LXX and critical scholars.

The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rWrap* WxB=q!</FONT> is very difficult; it occurs only here and in Joel 2:6 which also describes the fearful facial reaction to an invading army. It probably means: (1) to grow red in fear; (2) to grow pale in fear; or (3) to turn ashen in fear. This difficult phrase may be translated by the modern English idioms: "every face grows pale" or "every face flushes red in fear." <br>

The meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rWraP*</FONT> is debated and numerous etymologies have been suggested: (1) From <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rWrP*</FONT> ("cooking pot" KBL 777): LXX <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">toV provswpon ptvntwn wJ" provskauma xuvtra"</FONT> ("all their faces are like a blackened/burned pot"); Vulgate <i>et</i> <i>facies</i> <i>omnium</i> <i>sicut</i> <i>nigredo</i> <i>ollae</i> ("all their faces are like a black pot"); Targum Jonathan ("covered with black like a pot"). This approach is adopted by the KJV and AV: "the faces of them all gather blackness." (2) From <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">raP</FONT> ("beauty"). Taking <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jbq</FONT> in a private sense ("gather in"), several scholars propose: "to draw in beauty, withdraw color," hence: "their faces grow pale" (NASB, NIV); see S. R. Driver, <i>The Books of Joel and Amos</i>, 53; C. F. Keil, <i>The Minor Prophets</i>, 1:192-93; A. Haldar, <i>Studies in the Book of Nahum</i>, 59.

It is also reflected in the LXX reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJ nomhv</FONT> ("the pasture"). The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest emending to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hr&#180;u*m=W </FONT>("the cave"), which involves the metathesis of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">r</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">u</FONT>. This proposed emendation is designed to create a tighter parallelism with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/oum=</FONT> ("the den") in the preceding line. However, this emendation has no textual support and conflicts with the grammar of the rest of the line: the feminine noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hr&#180;u*m=W</FONT> ("the cave") would demand a feminine independent pronoun instead of the masculine independent pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aWh</FONT> which follows. Nevertheless, several English translations adopt the emendation (NJB, NEB, RSV, NRSV), while others follow the reading of the MT (KJV, NASB, NIV, NJPS).<br>
 <a name="fn147" href="nah.htm#fnB147"><sup>66</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:11) Alternately, "the lion...[once] prowled there." The construction <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v*</FONT>...<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rv#a&amp;</FONT> denotes "where...there" (BDB 81 [2]). This locative construction is approximately reflected in the LXX interrogative <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pou'</FONT> ("where?").<br>
 <a name="fn148" href="nah.htm#fnB148"><sup>67</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:11)  The meaning of the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ayb!l*</FONT> is debated. There are three basic approaches: (1) The MT reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ayb!l*</FONT>, which is supported by the Dead Sea Scrolls (4QpNah) which preserves the consonantal form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aybl</FONT> (see J. M. Allegro, <i>Discoveries in the Judaean Desert</i>, 5:38). Most English translations render <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ayb!l*</FONT> as "lioness," the parallel term for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hyra</FONT> ("lion"); so RSV, NASB, NIV, NJPS; in contrast, KJV has "old lion." Indeed, the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ayb!l*</FONT> ("lioness" or "lion"; BDB 522) occurs frequently in poetic texts (Gen 49:9; Num 23:24; 24:9; Deut 33:20; Isa 5:29; 30:6; Joel 1:6; Job 4:11; 38:39). The problem is the absence of a <i>vav</i> conjunction between the two nouns and the presence of a singular rather than plural verb: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aybl hyra ilh</FONT> ("lion [and] lioness prowled"). Furthermore, the term for "lioness" in the following verse is not <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ayb!l*</FONT> but <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ha*b=l!</FONT> (<i>HALOT</i> 515; BDB 522). (2) Due to the grammatical, syntactical, and lexical difficulties of the previous approach, several scholars propose that the MT's <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ayb!l*</FONT> is a Hiphil infinitive construct form shortened from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ayb!h*l=</FONT> ("to bring"); cf. Jer 27:7; 39:7; 2 Chr 31:10; <i>HALOT</i> 114. Because the Hiphil of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">awb</FONT> can depict an animal bringing food to its dependents (cf. 1 Kgs 17:6), they treat the line thus: "where the lion prowled to bring [food]" (Ehrlich, Haldar, Maier). The Dead Sea Scrolls (4QpNah) reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aybl</FONT> does not solve the problem because the <i>pesher</i> to this line uses <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">awbl</FONT> ("to enter"), and it is not clear whether this is a literal translation or creative word-play: "Its <i>pesher</i> concerns Demetrius, king of Greece, who sought to enter (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">awbl</FONT>) Jerusalem" (col. 1, line 4). (3) The LXX translation <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tou' eijselqei'n</FONT> ("would enter") seems to have confused the consonantal form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aybl</FONT> with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">awbl</FONT> which it viewed as Qal infinitive construct <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aobl*</FONT> from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aWB</FONT> ("to enter"). This approach is followed by at least one modern translation: "where the lion goes" (NRSV).<br>
 <a name="fn149" href="nah.htm#fnB149"><sup>68</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:11)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Elh</FONT> ("to go; to walk") is occasionally used of animals (1 Sam 6:12). Here it is nuanced "prowled" in the light of the hunting or stalking imagery in vv. 12-13.<br>
 <a name="fn150" href="nah.htm#fnB150"><sup>69</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:11) Or "and no one frightened [them]." Alternately, reflecting a different division of the lines, "Where the lion [and] lioness [once] prowled // the lion-cub--and no one disturbed [them]."<br>
 <a name="fn151" href="nah.htm#fnB151"><sup>70</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:12)  <i>Heb</i> "as much as he needs."

The title pictures God as the sovereign king who has at his disposal a multitude of attendants, messengers, and warriors to do his bidding.

 <a name="fn156" href="nah.htm#fnB156"><sup>75</sup></a><b>tc</b> (2:13)  The MT reads the 3fs suffix on a singular noun: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">HB*k=r]</FONT> ("her chariot"). However, the <i>BHS</i> editors suggest emending to the 2fs suffix on a plural noun: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">EBkr </FONT>("your chariots") due to the use of 2fs suffixes throughout this verse and the anomaly of the singular noun. On the other hand, the Dead Sea Scrolls (4QpNah) read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkbwr</FONT> ("your abundance") which is the <i>plene</i> spelling of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkbr</FONT> ("your abundance"). This reflects the transposition (metathesis) of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">k</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">b </FONT>in the consonantal forms <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbkr</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkbr</FONT>. The textual tradition attested at Qumran is reflected in the LXX's <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">plh'qo" sou</FONT> ("your abundance") which reflects a reading of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkbr</FONT> ("your abundance") as well. It should be noted that the <i>plene</i> form of the 2fs suffix appears elsewhere in the MT of this verse: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkkalm </FONT>("your messenger"). Although there is good evidence for the alternate traditions, the MT reading may be retained for three reasons: (1) The burning of enemy chariots was a common threat in ancient Near Eastern warfare (see D. R. Hillers, <i>Treaty-Curses and the Old Testament Prophets</i>, 60; K. J. Cathcart, "Treaty-Curses and the Book of Nahum," <i>CBQ</i> 35 [1973]: 182). (2) The singular <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bk#r\</FONT> ("chariot") is often used collectively to refer to all the chariots of a nation (Exod 14:7; Josh 11:4; 24:6; Judg 4:7, 13; 5:28). (3) The abrupt shift from the 2fs suffix on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ey]l^a@</FONT> ("I am against you!") to the 3fs suffix on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">HB*k=r]</FONT> ("her chariot") is an example of a common poetic/stylistic device: heterosis of second to third person (see Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 525 [4.5]). The 2fs suffix in the translation above is used simply for smooth literary style. This is a good example of how sensitivity to figures of speech, ancient Near Eastern backgrounds, and syntax can prevent unnecessary textual emendations.<br>
 <a name="fn157" href="nah.htm#fnB157"><sup>76</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:13) <i>Heb</i> "with smoke." The term "smoke" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/vu</FONT>) is a figure of speech (metonymy of effect for the cause) representing the fire which produces the smoke (Josh 8:19-20; Isa 65:5; cf. Rev 14:11). In the translation this has been replaced with "fire" since most English readers would find the expression "to burn [something] with smoke" unfamiliar.<br>
 <a name="fn158" href="nah.htm#fnB158"><sup>77</sup></a><b>tc</b> (2:13)  The MT reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ey]r~yp!k=W</FONT> ("and your young lions"), as reflected by the LXX's <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiV touV" levontav" sou</FONT> ("and your lions").

 <a name="fn160" href="nah.htm#fnB160"><sup>79</sup></a><b>tc</b> (2:13)  The MT reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkkalm</FONT> ("your messengers") has a very unusual ending: the plural ending of the noun is spelled defectively (short spelling), while the 2fs pronominal suffix is spelled <i>plene</i> (long spelling); see GKC &#167;91.<i>l</i>. It is possible that the final <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">h</FONT> is due to dittography with the first letter of the first word of the next verse, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yoh</FONT> ("Woe!"). On the other hand, the LXX reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">taV ejvrga sou</FONT> ("your deeds") which reflects <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ey]k^a&amp;l=m^</FONT> ("your deeds")--a confusion of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ealm</FONT> ("messenger") for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkalm</FONT> ("deed") due to the unusual Hebrew ending here.<br>
 <a name="fn161" href="nah.htm#fnB161"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:1) <i>Heb</i> "of bloods." The plural noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ymD</FONT> ("bloods") connotes "bloodshed" or "blood guilt" (BDB 196-97 [2]; <i>HALOT</i> 224-25 [5]; <i>DCH</i> 2:443-47). Human blood in its natural state in the body is generally designated by the singular form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;D</FONT> ("blood"); after it has been spilled, the plural form is used to denote the abundance of blood in quantity (Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Hebrew Syntax,</i> &#167;7 [4.1.b]; BDB 196 [2.f]). The plural is often used with the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Epv</FONT> ("to spill; to shed") to connote bloodshed (Gen 9:6; 37:22; Lev 17:4; Num 35:33; Deut 21:7; 1 Sam 25:31; 1 Kgs 18:28; 2 Kgs 21:16; 24:4; 1 Chr 22:8; Ezek 16:38; 22:4, 6, 9, 12, 27; 23:45; 33:25; 36:18; Prov 1:16). The plural often denotes bloodshed (Gen 4:10; 2 Sam 3:27, 28; 16:8; 20:12; 1 Kgs 2:5; 2 Kgs 9:7, 26, 33; 2 Chr 24:25; Job 16:18; Isa 1:15; 4:4; 9:4; 26:21; 33:15; 34:3, 6, 7; Ezek 7:23; 16:6, 9, 36; 21:37; 22:13; 24:8; Hos 1:4; 4:2; Hab 2:8, 12, 17; Mic 3:10; Zech 9:7) or blood-guilt (Exod 22:1; Lev 20:9; Num 35:27; Deut 19:10; 22:8; Judg 9:24; 1 Sam 25:26, 33; 2 Sam 21:1; Isa 33:15; Ezek 9:9). The term can refer to murder (2 Sam 16:7, 8; Pss 5:7; 26:9; 55:24; 59:3; 139:10; Prov 29:10) or more generally, connote social injustice, cruelty, and oppression (Deut 21:8, 9; 1 Sam 19:5; 2 Kgs 21:6; 24:4; Pss 94:21; 106:38; Prov 6:17; Isa 59:7; Jer 7:6; 22:3; Joel 4:19; Jon 1:14). The term may refer to blood that has been shed in war (1 Kgs 2:5) and the unnecessary shedding of blood of one's enemy (1 Kgs 2:31), which is probably the intended meaning here. The phrase "city of bloodshed" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ymD ryu</FONT>, "city of bloods") is used elsewhere to describe a city held guilty before God of blood-guilt and about to be judged by God (Ezek 22:2; 24:6).<br>

In related Semitic languages (Akkadian, Ugaritic, and Arabic) the root <i>raqad</i> means "to dance; to skip about."

 <a name="fn181" href="nah.htm#fnB181"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:4) <i>Heb</i> "Because of the many harlotries of the harlot." The MT connects v. 4 with vv. 5-6; however, the LXX connects v. 4 with vv. 1-3. The Masoretic division is followed by NRSV and NJPS; the LXX division is followed by KJV and NIV; and the NASB division equivocates on the issue. It is best to connect v. 4 with vv. 5-6 (following the MT) because: (1) vv. 1-3 constitute a self-contained woe-oracle; and (2) the theme of the harlot unifies vv. 4-6: the accusation against the harlot (v. 4) and the stereotypical punishment of the harlot (vv. 5-6).<br>

Dahood repoints the MT as a Hophal participle, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tr\K#M%h^</FONT>, from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rkn</FONT> ("to know; to recognize"): "the one who is known [by the nations for her harlotries]" (M. Dahood, "Causal Beth and the Root NKR in Nahum 3.4," <i>Bib</i> 52 [1971]: 395-96). The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest emending the MT due to metathesis to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tr\m#K)h^</FONT> from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rmk</FONT> II ("to ensnare"; <i>HALOT</i> 482) which is related to Assyrian <i>kamaru</i> [A] ("to ensnare"): "The one who ensnares [nations]." The related nouns "snare; net" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rmkm</FONT>) and "net" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">trmkm</FONT>) are used as metaphors of the wicked destroying their victims (Ps 141:10; Isa 51:20; Hab 1:15, 16). This approach is adopted by NJPS: "who ensnared nations." Others suggest emending to the Qal participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tr\m#K)h^</FONT> from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rmk</FONT> III ("to destroy; to overthrow"; BDB 485) related to Assyrian <i>kamaru</i> [B] ("to destroy; to annihilate"): "the one who destroys nations."

 <b>tn </b> () <i>Heb</i> "sells." Alternately, "enslaves"; or perhaps "deceives." Most scholars derive the Qal participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tr\k#M)h^</FONT> from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rkm</FONT> ("to sell; to betray"): "who sells nations." When used in reference to people, this verb may denote three things: (1) to sell slaves or prisoners of war (Exod 21:8; Deut 21:14; 24:7; Joel 4:3, 6); (2) to sell off someone into the hands of the enemy, that is, to give someone entirely into their power (Exod 21:7; 22:2; Deut 32:30; Judg 2:14; 3:8; 4:2; 10:7; 1 Sam 12:9; Isa 50:1; Joel 4:8; Ps 44:13); and (3) to betray someone (possibly the meaning here in Nah 3:4?); see <i>HALOT</i> 581-82; BDB 569. This is related to Assyrian <i>makara</i> ("to carry out trade; to make merchandise of"). Some translations nuance <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tr\k#M)h^</FONT> as "who sells nations" (KJV, NASB); others nuance it metonymically, "who enslaves nations" (NIV, NRSV). Thomas derives <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tr\k#M)h^ </FONT>from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rkm</FONT> II ("to deceive; to beguile; to betray") which is related to Arabic <i>makara</i> ("to betray"; see <i>HALOT</i> 581-82): "who deceives the nations" (D.

The MT reading is preferred for several reasons: (1) it is supported by the scrolls from Wadi Murabba'at; (2) it is the most difficult reading; and (3) it explains the origin of the LXX which probably harmonized this with the preceding 3 feminine singular pronoun. Abrupt switches from third to second person are commonly found in poetic and prophetic literature (e.g., Deut 32:15; Isa 5:8; Jer. 29:19; Job 16:7) as well as in Northwest Semitic curses (see S.

The past-time sense is supported by the Syriac and Vulgate. The LXX, however, misunderstood the form as an imperfect: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejdafiou'sin</FONT> ("they shall dash"). Not recognizing that the form is a preterite, the <i>BHS</i> editors suggest emending to Pual perfect <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WvF=r%</FONT> ("they were dashed in pieces").

The textual variant arose due to orthographic confusion between <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">d</FONT> (<i>dalet</i>) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">r</FONT> (<i>resh</i>)--two Hebrew letters very similar in appearance. The root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ddy</FONT> is relatively rare--it occurs only two other times (Obad 11; Jon 4:3)--therefore, it might have been confused with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hry</FONT> which appears more frequently.<br>

Several scholars suggest nuancing the Niphal in a passive sense: "you will be concealed" or "you will be obscured" (BDB 761 [2]).

 <a name="fn209" href="nah.htm#fnB209"><sup>49</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:12)  This extended simile compares the siege of Nineveh with reapers shaking a tree to harvest the "first-ripe fruit." Fruit that matured quickly and ripened early in the season dropped from the trees more easily than the later crop which developed more slowly (Isa 28:4). To harvest the later crop the worker had to climb the tree (sixteen to twenty feet tall) and pick the figs by hand from each branch. On the other hand, the fruit from the early harvest could be gathered quickly and with a minimum of effort by simply shaking the trunk of the tree (G. Dalman, <i>Arbeit und Sitte in Palestina</i>, 1:378-80). The point of this simile is that Nineveh would fall easily and quickly.<br>

The imperfect tense verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wuwny</FONT> ("they are shaken") depicts a future-time action conceived as a real situation expected to occur (see Jo&uuml;on-Muraoka, <i>Grammar</i>, &#167;167; Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Hebrew Syntax,</i> &#167;31 [6.1]).<br>

However, this is not necessary; the infinitive absolute is used for stylistic variation and often precedes imperatives to add urgency. The MT makes sense as it stands.<br>
 <a name="fn223" href="nah.htm#fnB223"><sup>63</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:16) Or "Increase!" or "You have increased." The form and meaning of the MT perfect tense verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tbrh</FONT> (from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">brh</FONT>, "to increase") is debated. The LXX translated it as a simple past meaning: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejplhvquna"</FONT> ("you have multiplied"). However, some scholars argue for an imperatival form or an imperatival nuance due to the presence of the two preceding volitive forms: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dB@K^t=h!</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yd]B=K^t=h!</FONT> ("Multiply...multiply!"). For example, the editors of <i>BHS</i> propose emending the perfect tense <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tbrh</FONT> to the imperative form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ybrh</FONT> ("multiply!"). K. J. Cathcart (<i>Nahum in the Light of Northwest Semitic</i>, 145) retains the MT perfect form, but classifies it as a precative perfect with an imperatival nuance ("increase!"). Note: Some scholars deny the existence of the precative perfect in Hebrew (G.R. Driver, <i>Hebrew Tenses</i>, 25-26; Kautsch, <i>Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar</i>, 106 n. 2); however, others argue for its existence (A. B. Davidson, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 41, remark 5; Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Hebrew Syntax,</i> &#167;30 [5.4.c, d]).<br>
 <a name="fn224" href="nah.htm#fnB224"><sup>64</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:16)  The words "they are like" are not in the Hebrew text, but are supplied in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn225" href="nah.htm#fnB225"><sup>65</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:16)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">fvP</FONT> ("to strip off") refers to the action of the locust shedding its outer layer of skin or sheaths of wings while in the larval stage (BDB 833). In a similar sense, this verb is normally used of a person stripping off garments (Gen 37:23; Lev 6:4; 16:23; Num 20:26, 28; 1 Sam 18:4; 19:24; 31:8, 9; 2 Sam 23:10; 1 Chr 10:8, 9; Neh 4:17; Job 19:9; 22:6; Ezek 16:39; 23:26; 26:16; 44:19; Hos 2:5; Mic 2:8; 3:3).<br>
 <a name="fn226" href="nah.htm#fnB226"><sup>66</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:17) Or "your guards." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ey]r~z&#180;G+m!</FONT> ("your courtiers") is related to Assyrian <i>manzazu</i> ("courtier"; <i>AHw</i> 639.a) or <i>massaru</i> ("guard"; <i>AHw</i> 621.a); see <i>HALOT</i> 601). The nuance "princes," suggested by older lexicographers (BDB 634), is obsolete.<br>
 <a name="fn227" href="nah.htm#fnB227"><sup>67</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:17)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ey]r~p=s=f^</FONT> ("your scribes") from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rspf</FONT> ("scribe; marshal") is a loanword from Assyrian <i>tupsarru </i>and Sumerian <i>DUB.SAR</i> ("tablet-writer; scribe; official"); see BDB 381; <i>HALOT</i> 379. This term is also attested in Ugaritic <i>tupsarru</i> (<i>PRU</i> 3:236) and in Phoenician <i>dpsr</i> (<i>DISO</i> 102). As in Jer 51:27, it is used of military and administrative officials (<i>HALOT</i> 379). This term designated military officials who recorded the names of recruits and the military activities of Assyrian kings (see P. Machinist, "Assyria and its Image in the First Isaiah," <i>JAOS</i> 103 [1983]: 736).<br>
 <a name="fn228" href="nah.htm#fnB228"><sup>68</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:17) <i>Heb</i> "it flees."<br>
 <a name="fn229" href="nah.htm#fnB229"><sup>69</sup></a><b>tc</b> (3:17)  The <i>BHS</i> editors propose redividing the singular MT reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ddonw</FONT> ("and it flees") to the plural <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wddonw</FONT> ("and they flee") due to the difficulty of a singular verb. However, the LXX supports the singular MT reading. The subject is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwg</FONT> ("swarm"), not individual locusts.<br>
 <a name="fn230" href="nah.htm#fnB230"><sup>70</sup></a><b>tc</b> (3:17)  The MT reads the noun with 3ms suffix <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">omoqm=</FONT> ("its place"). The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest emending to 3mpl suffix <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;m*oqm=</FONT> ("their place"). The MT is supported by the LXX reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tovn tovpon aujth'"</FONT> ("its place"), which has a singular suffix. The 3ms suffix is not as awkward as the <i>BHS</i> editors claim--its antecedent is the singular <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbra</FONT> ("locust") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ybg bwg</FONT> ("a swarm of locusts"), as reflected by the 3ms verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ddonw</FONT> ("it flies away").<br>
 <a name="fn231" href="nah.htm#fnB231"><sup>71</sup></a><b>tc</b> (3:17)  The MT reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;Y&#180;a^</FONT> ("Where are they?"); see, e.g., Isa 19:12; <i>DCH</i> 1:202; <i>HALOT</i> 40). On the other hand, the LXX's <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oujaiv aujtoi'"</FONT> ("Woe to them!") seems to reflect a reading of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;Y&#180;a#</FONT> ("Alas to them!"). The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest emending to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hk*ya@</FONT> ("Alas!" or "How?") and join it to v. 18, or <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm^ yoa</FONT> ("Woe! Why...?") joined to v. 18 (<i>DCH</i> 1:202). <i>HALOT</i> 40 suggests the emendation <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">y;a</FONT> ("Alas to you!").<br>
 <b>tn </b> (3:17) <i>Heb</i> "Its place is not known--where are they?" The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;Y&#180;a^</FONT> has been taken in various ways: (1) an interrogative adverb with 3mpl suffix ("where are they?"; GKC &#167;100.<i>o</i>; BDB 32 [b]); (2) an interrogative particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ya </FONT>("where?") lengthened to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hYa</FONT> and written with the enclitic particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;-</FONT> (GKC &#167;100.<i>g</i>), similar to <i>ayyami</i> ("where?") in Assyrian (<i>CAD</i> 1.1.220); see W. A. Maier, <i>The Book of Nahum</i>, 356; R. D. Patterson, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah</i>, 111; T. E. McComiskey, ed., <i>The Minor Prophets</i>, 2:826.<br>
 <a name="fn232" href="nah.htm#fnB232"><sup>72</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:18)  The term <i>shepherd</i> was frequently used in the ancient Near East in reference to kings and other leaders (royal, political, military). Here, the expression <i>your shepherds</i> is an implied comparison (hypocatastasis) referring to the royal/military leadership of Assyria.<br>
 <a name="fn233" href="nah.htm#fnB233"><sup>73</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:18)  The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">y;r\yD]a^</FONT> ("your officers") from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ryDa</FONT> ("high, noble, majestic one") designates "prominent people" in society (Judg 5:13, 25; Jer 14:3; Ps 16:3; Neh 3:5; 10:30; 2 Chr 23:20) and prominent "officers" in the military (Nah 2:6; 3:18); see <i>HALOT</i> 14; BDB 12. This is related to Assyrian <i>adaru</i> ("high noble official").<br>
 <a name="fn234" href="nah.htm#fnB234"><sup>74</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:18)  The MT reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WnK=v=y]</FONT> ("they are settling down; they are lying down") from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/kv </FONT>("to settle down; to lie down"). The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest emending to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wnv=y&#180;</FONT> ("they are slumbering") in order to produce a tighter parallelism with the parallel verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wmn&#180;</FONT> ("they are sleeping"). However, the MT has an adequate parallelism because the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/kv</FONT> ("to lie down") is often used in reference to the dead lying down in the grave (Job 4:19; 26:5; Ps 94:17; Isa 26:19); see BDB 1015 (2.b). This is a figurative expression (hypocatastasis) for someone dying. Although the LXX misunderstood the syntax of this line, the LXX translation <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejkoivmise</FONT> ("he has laid low") points to a form of the Masoretic verbal root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/kv</FONT> ("to lie down; to settle down").<br>
 <a name="fn235" href="nah.htm#fnB235"><sup>75</sup></a><b>tc</b> (3:19)  The MT reads the <i>hapax</i> <i>legomenon</i> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hhK</FONT> ("relief; alleviation"). On the other hand, the LXX reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ijvasi"</FONT> ("healing") which seems to reflect a reading of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hhG</FONT> ("cure; healing"). In the light of the LXX, the <i>BHS</i> editors suggest emending the MT to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hhG</FONT>--which occurs only once elsewhere (Prov 17:22)--on the basis of orthographic and phonological confusion between Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">k</FONT> (<i>kaf</i>) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">g</FONT> (<i>gimel</i>). This emendation would produce the common ancient Near Eastern treaty-curse: "there is no cure for your wound" (e.g., Hos 5:13); see <i>HALOT</i> 461; K. J. Cathcart, "Treaty-Curses and the Book of Nahum," <i>CBQ</i> 35 (1973): 186; D. Hillers, <i>Treaty-Curses and the Old Testament Prophets</i>, 64-66.<br>
