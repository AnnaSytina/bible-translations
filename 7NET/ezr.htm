He disseminated<a name="fnB4" href="ezr_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> a proclamation<a name="fnB5" href="ezr_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> throughout all his kingdom, announcing in a written edict the following:<a name="fnB6" href="ezr_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 2>2  "So says King Cyrus of Persia: <p>
"`The LORD God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth. He has instructed me to build a temple<a name="fnB7" href="ezr_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> for him in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.

<bqverse 4>4  Let anyone who survives in any of those places where he is a resident foreigner be helped by his neighbors<a name="fnB9" href="ezr_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> with silver, gold, equipment, and animals, along with voluntary offerings for the temple of God which is in Jerusalem.'"<a name="_Toc494012176"></a></p>
<p><i>The Exiles Prepare for Returning to Jerusalem</i>
<p>
<bqverse 5>5  Then the leaders<a name="fnB10" href="ezr_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> of Judah and Benjamin, along with the priests and the Levites--all those whose mind God had stirred--got ready to go up in order to build the temple of the LORD in Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 6>6  All their neighbors assisted<a name="fnB11" href="ezr_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> them with silver utensils,<a name="fnB12" href="ezr_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> gold, equipment, animals, and expensive gifts, not to mention all the voluntary offerings.<p>

<bqverse 7>7  Then King Cyrus brought out the vessels of the LORD's temple which Nebuchadnezzar had brought from Jerusalem and had displayed<a name="fnB13" href="ezr_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> in the temple of his gods.

<bqverse 9>9  The inventory<a name="fnB17" href="ezr_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> of these items was as follows:</p>

<bqverse 11>11  All these gold and silver vessels totaled 5,400. Sheshbazzar brought them all along when the captives were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem.

<bqverse 63>63 The governor<a name="fnB42" href="ezr_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> instructed them not to eat any of the sacred food until there was a priest who could consult<a name="fnB43" href="ezr_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> the Urim and Thummim.<p>

<bqverse 64>64  The entire group numbered 42,360, 
<bqverse 65>65  not counting their male and female servants, who numbered 7,337. They also had 200 male and female singers

<bqverse 68>68  When they came to the LORD's temple in Jerusalem, some of the family leaders<a name="fnB44" href="ezr_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> offered voluntary offerings for the temple of God in order to rebuild<a name="fnB45" href="ezr_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> it on its site. 
<bqverse 69>69  As they were able,<a name="fnB46" href="ezr_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> they gave to the treasury for this work 61,000 drachmas<a name="fnB47" href="ezr_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> of gold, 5,000 minas<a name="fnB48" href="ezr_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> of silver, and 100 priestly robes.<a name="fnB49" href="ezr_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<p><i>The Altar is Rebuilt</i>
<p><A NAME="3"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> When the seventh month arrived and the Israelites<a name="fnB50" href="ezr_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> were living<a name="fnB51" href="ezr_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> in their<a name="fnB52" href="ezr_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> towns, the people assembled<a name="fnB53" href="ezr_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> in<a name="fnB54" href="ezr_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 2>2  Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak<a name="fnB55" href="ezr_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> and his priestly<b> </b>colleagues<a name="fnB56" href="ezr_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and his colleagues<a name="fnB57" href="ezr_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> started to build<a name="fnB58" href="ezr_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> the altar of the God of Israel so they could offer burnt offerings on it as required by<a name="fnB59" href="ezr_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> the law of Moses the man of God. 
<bqverse 3>3  They established the altar on its foundations, for they were in terror of the local peoples,<a name="fnB60" href="ezr_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> and they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD, both the morning and the evening offerings. 
<bqverse 4>4 They observed the Festival of Temporary Shelters<a name="fnB61" href="ezr_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> as required and offered the proper number of<a name="fnB62" href="ezr_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> daily burnt offerings according to the requirement for each day. 
<bqverse 5>5 Afterwards they offered the continual burnt offerings and those for the new moons and those for all the holy assemblies of the LORD and all those that were being voluntarily offered to the LORD. 
<bqverse 6>6  From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD. But the LORD's temple was not at that time established.<a name="fnB63" href="ezr_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494012179"></a></p>
<p><i>Preparations for Rebuilding the Temple</i>
<p>
<bqverse 7>7  So they provided money for the masons and carpenters, and food, beverages, and olive oil for the people of Sidon and Tyre, so that they would bring cedar timber from Lebanon to the seaport<a name="fnB64" href="ezr_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> at Joppa, in accord with the edict of King Cyrus of Persia. 
<bqverse 8>8  In the second year after they had come to the temple of God in Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak initiated the work,<a name="fnB65" href="ezr_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> along with the rest of their associates,<a name="fnB66" href="ezr_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> the priests and the Levites, and all those who were coming to Jerusalem from the exile. They appointed<a name="fnB67" href="ezr_note.htm#fn67"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> the Levites who were at least twenty years old<a name="fnB68" href="ezr_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> to take charge of the work on the LORD's temple. 
<bqverse 9>9  So Jeshua appointed both his sons and his relatives,<a name="fnB69" href="ezr_note.htm#fn69"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> Kadmiel and his sons (the sons of Yehudah<a name="fnB70" href="ezr_note.htm#fn70"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a>), to take charge of the workers in the temple of God, along with the sons of Henadad, their sons, and their relatives<a name="fnB71" href="ezr_note.htm#fn71"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> the Levites. 
<bqverse 10>10  When the builders established the LORD's temple, the priests, ceremonially attired and with their clarions, and the Levites (the sons of Asaph) with their cymbals, stood to praise the LORD according to the instructions left by<a name="fnB72" href="ezr_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> King David of Israel. 
<bqverse 11>11  With antiphonal response they sang,<a name="fnB73" href="ezr_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> praising and glorifying the LORD: </p>
<br>"For he is good;<br>
his loving kindness toward Israel is forever." </ul><p>All the people gave a loud<a name="fnB74" href="ezr_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> shout as they praised the LORD when the temple of the LORD was established. 
<bqverse 12>12  Many of the priests, the Levites, and the leaders<a name="fnB75" href="ezr_note.htm#fn75"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a>--older people who had seen with their own eyes the former temple while it was still established--were weeping loudly,<a name="fnB76" href="ezr_note.htm#fn76"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> and many others raised their voice in a joyous shout. 
<bqverse 13>13  People were unable to tell the difference between the sound of joyous shouting and the sound of the people's weeping, for the people were shouting so loudly that the sound was heard a long way off.

<p><i>Opposition to Their Building Efforts</i>
<p><A NAME="4"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin learned that the former exiles<a name="fnB77" href="ezr_note.htm#fn77"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> were building a temple for the LORD God of Israel, 
<bqverse 2>2  they came to Zerubbabel and the leaders<a name="fnB78" href="ezr_note.htm#fn78"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> and said to them, "Let us help you build, for like you we seek your God and we have been sacrificing to him<a name="fnB79" href="ezr_note.htm#fn79"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> from the time of King Esarhaddon of Assyria, who brought us here." 
<bqverse 3>3  But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the leaders of Israel said to them, "You have no right<a name="fnB80" href="ezr_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> to help us build the temple of our God, for we will build it by ourselves for the LORD God of Israel, just as King Cyrus, the king of Persia, has commanded us." 
<bqverse 4>4  Then the local people<a name="fnB81" href="ezr_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> began to discourage<a name="fnB82" href="ezr_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> the people of Judah and to dishearten them from building. 
<bqverse 5>5  They were hiring advisors to oppose them, so as to frustrate their plans, throughout the time<a name="fnB83" href="ezr_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> of King Cyrus of Persia until the reign of King Darius<a name="fnB84" href="ezr_note.htm#fn84"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> of Persia.<a name="_Toc494012181"></a></p>

<bqverse 8>8  Rehum the commander<a name="fnB90" href="ezr_note.htm#fn90"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter concerning Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows: 
<bqverse 9>9  Then Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their colleagues--the judges, rulers, officials, secretaries of the Erechites, Babylonians, people of Susa (that is, the Elamites), 
<bqverse 10>10  and the rest of nations whom the great and noble Ashurbanipal<a name="fnB91" href="ezr_note.htm#fn91"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> deported and settled in the cities<a name="fnB92" href="ezr_note.htm#fn92"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> of Samaria and other places in the Trans-Euphrates. 
<bqverse 11>11  This is a copy of the letter they sent to him:<p>
"To Artaxerxes the king, from your servants in<a name="fnB93" href="ezr_note.htm#fn93"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> the Trans-Euphrates. 
<bqverse 12>12  Now<a name="fnB94" href="ezr_note.htm#fn94"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> let the king be aware that the Jews who came up to us from you have gone to Jerusalem. They are rebuilding that rebellious and odious city. They are completing its walls and repairing its foundations. 
<bqverse 13>13  Let the king also be aware that if this city is built and its walls are completed, no more tax, custom, or toll will be paid, and the royal<a name="fnB95" href="ezr_note.htm#fn95"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> treasury will suffer loss. 
<bqverse 14>14 In light of the fact that we are loyal to the king,<a name="fnB96" href="ezr_note.htm#fn96"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> and since it does not seem appropriate to us that the king should sustain damage, we are sending the king this information<a name="fnB97" href="ezr_note.htm#fn97"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  so that he may initiate a search of the records<a name="fnB98" href="ezr_note.htm#fn98"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> of his predecessors<a name="fnB99" href="ezr_note.htm#fn99"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> and discover in those records<a name="fnB100" href="ezr_note.htm#fn100"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> that this city is rebellious<a name="fnB101" href="ezr_note.htm#fn101"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> and injurious to both kings and provinces, producing internal revolts from long ago.<a name="fnB102" href="ezr_note.htm#fn102"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> It is for this very reason that this city was destroyed. 
<bqverse 16>16  We therefore are informing the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed, you will not retain control<a name="fnB103" href="ezr_note.htm#fn103"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> of this portion of Trans-Euphrates."<p>

<bqverse 17>17  The king sent the following response:<p>
"To Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their colleagues who live in Samaria and other parts of the Trans-Euphrates: Greetings!<a name="fnB104" href="ezr_note.htm#fn104"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18 The letter you sent to us has been translated and read in my presence. 
<bqverse 19>19  So<b> </b>I gave orders, and it was determined<a name="fnB105" href="ezr_note.htm#fn105"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> that this city from long ago has been engaging in insurrection against kings. It has continually engaged in rebellion and revolt. 
<bqverse 20>20 Powerful kings have been over Jerusalem who ruled throughout the entire Trans-Euphrates and who were the beneficiaries of tribute, custom, and toll. 
<bqverse 21>21  Now give orders that these men cease their work and that this city not be rebuilt until such time as I so instruct.<a name="fnB106" href="ezr_note.htm#fn106"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  Exercise appropriate caution so that there is no negligence in this matter. Why should danger increase to the point that kings sustain damage?"<p>

<bqverse 23>23  Then, as soon as the copy of the letter from King Artaxerxes was read in the presence of Rehum, Shishai the scribe, and their colleagues, they proceeded promptly to the Jews in Jerusalem<a name="fnB107" href="ezr_note.htm#fn107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> and stopped them with threat of armed force.<a name="fnB108" href="ezr_note.htm#fn108"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 24>24  So the work on the temple of God in Jerusalem came to a halt. It remained halted until the second year of the reign of King Darius of Persia.

<p><i>Tattenai Appeals to Darius</i>
<p><A NAME="5"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Then Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo prophesied concerning the Jews who were in Judah and in Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel who was over them. 
<bqverse 2>2  Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak began<a name="fnB109" href="ezr_note.htm#fn109"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> to rebuild the temple of God in Jerusalem. The prophets of God were with them, supporting them.<p>

<bqverse 3>3 At that time Tattenai governor of the Trans-Euphrates, Shethar-Bozenai, and their colleagues came to them and asked, "Who gave you authority<a name="fnB110" href="ezr_note.htm#fn110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> to rebuild this temple and to complete its walls?"<a name="fnB111" href="ezr_note.htm#fn111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4 They<a name="fnB112" href="ezr_note.htm#fn112"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> also asked them, "What are the names of the men who are building this structure?" 
<bqverse 5>5 But God was watching over<a name="fnB113" href="ezr_note.htm#fn113"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> the elders of Judah, and they were not stopped<a name="fnB114" href="ezr_note.htm#fn114"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> until a report could be dispatched<a name="fnB115" href="ezr_note.htm#fn115"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> to Darius and a letter could be sent back concerning this.<p>

<bqverse 6>6 This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai governor of the Trans-Euphrates, Shethar-Bozenai, and his colleagues who were the officials of the Trans-Euphrates sent to King Darius. 
<bqverse 7>7 The report they sent to him was written as follows:<p>
"To Darius the king: All greetings!<a name="fnB116" href="ezr_note.htm#fn116"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8 Let it be known to the king that we have gone to the province of Judah, to the temple of the great God. It is being built with large stones and timbers are being placed in the walls. This work is being done with all diligence and is prospering in their hands. 
<bqverse 9>9 We inquired of those elders, asking them, `Who gave you the authority to rebuild this temple and to complete its walls?' 
<bqverse 10>10 We also inquired of their names in order to inform you, so that we might write the names of the men who were their leaders. 
<bqverse 11>11 They responded to us in the following way: `We are servants of the God of heaven and earth. We are rebuilding the temple which was previously built many years ago. A great king<a name="fnB117" href="ezr_note.htm#fn117"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> of Israel built it and completed it. 
<bqverse 12>12 But after our ancestors<a name="fnB118" href="ezr_note.htm#fn118"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> angered the God of heaven, he delivered them into the hands<a name="fnB119" href="ezr_note.htm#fn119"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this temple and exiled the people to Babylon. 
<bqverse 13>13  But in the first year of King Cyrus of Babylon, King Cyrus enacted a decree to rebuild this temple of God. 
<bqverse 14>14  Even the gold and silver vessels of the temple of God that Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem and had brought to the palace of Babylon--even those things King Cyrus brought from the palace of Babylon and presented<a name="fnB120" href="ezr_note.htm#fn120"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> to a man by the name of Sheshbazzar whom he had appointed as governor. 
<bqverse 15>15  He said to him, "Take these vessels and go deposit them in the temple in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt in its proper location."<a name="fnB121" href="ezr_note.htm#fn121"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  Then this Sheshbazzar went and laid the foundations of the temple of God in Jerusalem. From that time to the present moment<a name="fnB122" href="ezr_note.htm#fn122"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> it has been in the process of being rebuilt, although it is not yet finished.'<p>

<bqverse 17>17  "Now if the king is so inclined, let a search be conducted in the royal archives there in Babylon, in order to determine whether King Cyrus did in fact issue orders for this temple of God to be rebuilt in Jerusalem. Then let the king send to us a decision concerning this matter."

<p><i>Darius Issues a Decree</i>
<p><A NAME="6"><b>

<bqverse 5>5  Furthermore, let the gold and silver vessels of the temple of God, which Nebuchadnezzar brought from the temple in Jerusalem and carried to Babylon, be returned and brought to their proper place in the temple in Jerusalem. Let them be deposited in the temple of God.' <p>

<bqverse 6>6  "Now Tattenai governor of Trans-Euphrates, Shethar Bozenai, and their colleagues, the officials of the Trans-Euphrates--all of you stay far away from there!

<bqverse 8>8  "I also hereby issue orders as to what you are to do with those elders of the Jews in order to rebuild this temple of God. From the royal treasury, from the taxes of Trans-Euphrates the complete costs will be given to these men, so that there may be no halt.

<p><i>The Temple Is Finally Dedicated</i>
<p>
<bqverse 13>13  Then Tattenai governor of the Trans-Euphrates, Shethar-Bozenai, and their colleagues acted accordingly--with precision, just as Darius the king had given instructions.<a name="fnB136" href="ezr_note.htm#fn136"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14 The elders of the Jews continued building and prospering, while at the same time<a name="fnB137" href="ezr_note.htm#fn137"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> Haggai the prophet and Zachariah the son of Iddo continued prophesying. They built and brought it to completion by the command of the God of Israel and by the command of Cyrus and Darius and Artaxerxes (king of Persia). 
<bqverse 15>15  They finished this temple on the third day of the month Adar, which is the sixth<a name="fnB138" href="ezr_note.htm#fn138"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> year of the reign of King Darius.<p>

<bqverse 17>17  For the dedication of this temple of God they offered one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and twelve male goats for the sin of all Israel, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. 
<bqverse 18>18  They appointed the priests by their divisions and the Levites by their divisions over the worship of God at Jerusalem, in accord with the book of Moses. 
<bqverse 19>19 <a name="fnB141" href="ezr_note.htm#fn141"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> The exiles observed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.

<bqverse 21>21  The Israelites who were returning from the exile ate it, along with all those who had separated themselves from the uncleanness of the nations of the land to seek the LORD God of Israel. 
<bqverse 22>22  They observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with joy, for the LORD had given them joy and had changed the opinion<a name="fnB143" href="ezr_note.htm#fn143"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> of the king of Assyria toward them, so that he assisted<a name="fnB144" href="ezr_note.htm#fn144"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> them in the work on the temple of God, the God of Israel.

<p><i>The Arrival of Ezra</i>
<p><A NAME="7"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Now after these things had happened, during the reign of King Artaxerxes<a name="fnB145" href="ezr_note.htm#fn145"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah came up from Babylon.<a name="fnB146" href="ezr_note.htm#fn146"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> Ezra was the son of Azariah, who was the son of Hilkiah, 
<bqverse 2>2  who was the son of Shallum, who was the son of Zadok, who was the son of Ahitub, 
<bqverse 3>3  who was the son of Amariah, who was the son of Azariah, who was the son of Meraioth, 
<bqverse 4>4  who was the son of Zerahiah, who was the son of Uzzi, who was the son of Bukki, 
<bqverse 5>5  who was the son of Abishua, who was the son of Phinehas, who was the son of Eleazar, who was the son of Aaron the chief priest. 
<bqverse 6>6  This Ezra is the one who came up from Babylon. He was a scribe who was skilled in the law of Moses which the LORD God of Israel had given. The king supplied him with everything he requested, for the hand of the LORD his God was on him. 
<bqverse 7>7  In the seventh year of King Artaxerxes, Ezra brought<a name="fnB147" href="ezr_note.htm#fn147"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> up to Jerusalem some of the Israelites and some of the priests, the Levites, the attendants, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants. 
<bqverse 8>8  He entered Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king. 
<bqverse 9>9  On the first day of the first month he had determined<a name="fnB148" href="ezr_note.htm#fn148"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> the ascent from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month he arrived at Jerusalem, for the good hand of his God was on him. 
<bqverse 10>10  Now Ezra had given himself<a name="fnB149" href="ezr_note.htm#fn149"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> to the study of the law of the LORD, to its observance, and to teaching its statutes and judgments in Israel.<a name="_Toc494012186"></a></p>

<bqverse 13>13  I have now issued a decree that anyone in my kingdom from the people of Israel--even the priests and Levites--who wishes to do so may go up with you to Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 14>14  You are authorized<a name="fnB153" href="ezr_note.htm#fn153"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> by the king and his seven advisors to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of your God which is in your possession,<a name="fnB154" href="ezr_note.htm#fn154"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15 and to bring silver and gold which the king and his advisors have freely contributed to the God of Israel, who resides in Jerusalem,

<bqverse 17>17  With this money you should be sure to purchase bulls, rams, and lambs, along with their meal offerings and their libations. You should bring them to the altar of the temple of your God which is in Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 18>18  You may do whatever seems appropriate to you and your colleagues with the rest of the silver and the gold, in keeping with the will of your God. 
<bqverse 19>19  Deliver to the God of Jerusalem the vessels that are given to you for the service of the temple of your God. 
<bqverse 20>20  The rest of the needs for the temple of your God that you may have to supply, you may do so from the royal treasury.<p>

<bqverse 21>21  "I, Artaxerxes the king, hereby issue orders to all the treasurers of Trans-Euphrates, that you precisely execute all that Ezra the priestly scribe of the law of the God of heaven may request of you--

<bqverse 23>23  Everything that the God of heaven has required should be precisely done for the temple of the God of heaven. Why should there be wrath against the empire of the king and his sons? 
<bqverse 24>24  Furthermore, be aware of the fact that you have no authority to impose tax, tribute, or toll on any of the priests, the Levites, the musicians, the doorkeepers, the temple servants, or the attendants at the temple of this God.<p>

<bqverse 25>25  "Now you, Ezra, in keeping with the wisdom of your God which you possess,<a name="fnB157" href="ezr_note.htm#fn157"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> appoint judges<a name="fnB158" href="ezr_note.htm#fn158"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> and court officials who know the laws of your God and who can arbitrate cases on behalf of all the people who are in Trans-Euphrates.

<bqverse 26>26  Everyone who does not observe both the law of your God and the law of the king will immediately be liable to the appropriate penalty, whether by death or banishment or confiscation of property or detainment in prison."<p>

<bqverse 27>27  Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, who so moved in the heart of the king to so honor the temple of the LORD which is in Jerusalem! 
<bqverse 28>28  He has also conferred his favor on me before the king, his advisors, and all the influential leaders of the king.

<p><i>The Exiles Travel to Jerusalem</i>
<p>
<bqverse 15>15 I had them assemble<a name="fnB166" href="ezr_note.htm#fn166"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> at the canal<a name="fnB167" href="ezr_note.htm#fn167"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> that flows toward Ahava, and we camped there for three days. I observed that the people and the priests were present, but I found no Levites there. 
<bqverse 16>16 So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan,<a name="fnB168" href="ezr_note.htm#fn168"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were leaders, and Joiarib and Elnathan, who were teachers. 
<bqverse 17>17 I sent them to Iddo, who was the leader in the place called Casiphia. I told them<a name="fnB169" href="ezr_note.htm#fn169"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> what to say to Iddo and his brethren,<a name="fnB170" href="ezr_note.htm#fn170"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> who were the temple servants in<a name="fnB171" href="ezr_note.htm#fn171"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> Casiphia, so they would bring us attendants for the temple of our God.<p>

<bqverse 18>18 Due to the fact that the good hand of our God was on us, they brought us a skilled man, from the descendants of Mahli the son of Levi son of Israel. This Sherebiah came,<a name="fnB172" href="ezr_note.htm#fn172"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> along with his sons and relatives,<a name="fnB173" href="ezr_note.htm#fn173"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 18 men, 
<bqverse 19>19 and Hashabiah, along with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, with his brothers and their sons, 20 men, 
<bqverse 20>20 and some of the temple servants that David and his chiefs had established for the work of the Levites--220 of them.They were all designated by name.<p>

<bqverse 21>21 I called for a fast there by the Ahava Canal, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and seek from him a safe journey for us, our children, and all our property. 
<bqverse 22>22 I was embarrassed to request soldiers and horsemen from the king to protect us from the enemy<a name="fnB174" href="ezr_note.htm#fn174"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> along the way, because we had said to the king, "The good hand of our God is on everyone who is seeking him, but his great anger<a name="fnB175" href="ezr_note.htm#fn175"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> is on everyone who forsakes him." 
<bqverse 23>23 So we fasted and prayed to our God about this, and he answered us. <p>

<bqverse 24>24 Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, together with<a name="fnB176" href="ezr_note.htm#fn176"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers, 
<bqverse 25>25 and I weighed out to them the silver, the gold, and the vessels intended for the temple of our God--items that the king, his advisers, his officials, and all Israel who were present had contributed. 
<bqverse 26>26 I weighed out to them<a name="fnB177" href="ezr_note.htm#fn177"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 650 talents of silver, silver vessels worth 100 talents,<a name="fnB178" href="ezr_note.htm#fn178"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 100 talents of gold, 
<bqverse 27>27 20 gold bowls worth 1,000 darics, and two exquisite vessels of gleaming bronze, as valuable as gold. 
<bqverse 28>28 Then<b> </b>I said to them, "You are holy to the LORD, just as these vessels are holy. The silver and the gold are a voluntary offering to the LORD, the God of your fathers. 
<bqverse 29>29  Be careful with them and protect them,<b> </b>until you weigh them out before the head priests and the Levites and the family leaders of Israel in Jerusalem, in the storerooms of the temple of the LORD."<p>

<bqverse 30>30 Then the priests and the Levites took charge of<a name="fnB179" href="ezr_note.htm#fn179"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> the silver, the gold, and the vessels that had been weighed out, to transport them to Jerusalem to the temple of our God. <p>

<bqverse 31>31  On the twelfth day of the first month we began traveling from the Ahava Canal to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from our enemy and from bandits<a name="fnB180" href="ezr_note.htm#fn180"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> along the way. 
<bqverse 32>32  So we came to Jerusalem, and we stayed there for three days. 
<bqverse 33>33  On the fourth day we weighed out the silver, the gold, and the vessels in the house of our God into the care<a name="fnB181" href="ezr_note.htm#fn181"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest, and Eleazar son of Phinehas, who were accompanied by Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui, who were Levites. 
<bqverse 34>34 Everything was verified by number and by weight, and the total weight was written down at that time. <p>

<bqverse 35>35 The exiles who were returning from the captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel--twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven male lambs, along with twelve male goats as a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering to the LORD. 
<bqverse 36>36  Then they presented the decrees of the king to the king's satraps and to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, who gave help to the people and to the temple of God.

<p><i>A Prayer of Ezra</i>
<p><A NAME="9"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Now when these things had been completed, the leaders approached me and said, "The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites have not separated themselves from the local residents<a name="fnB182" href="ezr_note.htm#fn182"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> who practice detestable things similar to those of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. 
<bqverse 2>2  Indeed, they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and for their sons and have intermingled the holy seed with the local residents. Worse still, the leaders and the Levites have been at the forefront of all of this!"<p>

<bqverse 3>3  When I heard this account, I tore my tunic and my robe and ripped out some of the hair of my head and beard. Then I sat down, quite devastated. 
<bqverse 4>4  Everyone who held the words of the God of Israel in awe<a name="fnB183" href="ezr_note.htm#fn183"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> gathered around me because of the unfaithful acts of the people of the exile.<a name="fnB184" href="ezr_note.htm#fn184"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> Devastated, I continued to sit there until the evening offering.<p>

<bqverse 5>5  At the time of the evening offering I got up from my self-abasement, with my torn tunic and robe, and then dropped to my knees and spread my hands to the LORD my God. 
<bqverse 6>6  I prayed,<a name="fnB185" href="ezr_note.htm#fn185"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> <p>
"O my God, I am ashamed and embarrassed, my God, to lift my face to you. For our iniquities have climbed higher than our head, and our guilt extends to the heavens. 
<bqverse 7>7 From the days of our fathers until this very day our guilt has been great. Because of our iniquities we, along with our kings and<a name="fnB186" href="ezr_note.htm#fn186"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> priests, have been delivered over by the local kings<a name="fnB187" href="ezr_note.htm#fn187"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> to sword, captivity, plunder, and embarrassment--right up to the present time. <p>

<bqverse 8>8 "But now briefly<a name="fnB188" href="ezr_note.htm#fn188"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> we have received mercy from the LORD our God, in that he has left us a remnant and has given us a secure position<a name="fnB189" href="ezr_note.htm#fn189"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a>in his holy place. Thus our God has enlightened our eyes and has given us a little relief in our time of servitude. 
<bqverse 9>9  Although we are slaves, our God has not abandoned us in our servitude. He has extended kindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, in that he has revived us<a name="fnB190" href="ezr_note.htm#fn190"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> to restore the temple of our God and to raise<a name="fnB191" href="ezr_note.htm#fn191"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> up its ruins and to give us a protective wall in Judah and Jerusalem.<p>

<bqverse 10>10 "And now what are we able to say after this, our God? For we have forsaken your commandments 
<bqverse 11>11  which you commanded us through your servants the prophets with the words:<a name="fnB192" href="ezr_note.htm#fn192"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> `The land that you are entering to possess is a land defiled by the impurities of the local residents.<a name="fnB193" href="ezr_note.htm#fn193"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> With their abominations they have filled it from one end to the other with their filthiness. 
<bqverse 12>12  Therefore do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons, and do not take their daughters in marriage for your sons. Do not ever seek their peace or welfare, so that you may be strong and may eat the good of the land and may leave it as an inheritance for your sons forever.'<p>

<bqverse 13>13  "Everything that has happened to us has come about because of our wicked actions and our great guilt. Even so, our God, you have exercised restraint<a name="fnB194" href="ezr_note.htm#fn194"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> toward our iniquities and have given us a remnant such as this. 
<bqverse 14>14  Shall we once again break your commandments and intermarry with these abominable peoples? Would you not be so angered by us as to wipe us out, with no survivor or remnant? 
<bqverse 15>15  O LORD God of Israel, you are righteous, for we are left as a remnant this day. Indeed, we stand before you in our guilt. However, because of this guilt<a name="fnB195" href="ezr_note.htm#fn195"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> no one can really stand before you."
<bqchapter 10>
<a name="_Toc494012190"></a></p>
<p><i>The People Confess Their Sins</i>
<p><A NAME="10"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself to the ground before the temple of God, a very large crowd of Israelites--men, women, and children alike--gathered around him. The people wept loudly. 
<bqverse 2>2 Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, from the descendants of Elam,<a name="fnB196" href="ezr_note.htm#fn196"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> addressed Ezra: <p>
"We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying<a name="fnB197" href="ezr_note.htm#fn197"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> foreign women from the local peoples.<a name="fnB198" href="ezr_note.htm#fn198"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> Nonetheless, there is still hope for Israel in this regard.<a name="fnB199" href="ezr_note.htm#fn199"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3 Therefore let us enact<a name="fnB200" href="ezr_note.htm#fn200"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> a covenant with our God to send away all these women and their offspring, in keeping with the counsel of my lord and of those who have regard for<a name="fnB201" href="ezr_note.htm#fn201"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> the commandments of our God. And let it be done according to the law. 
<bqverse 4>4 Get up, for this matter concerns you. We are with you, so be strong and act decisively."<p>

<bqverse 5>5 So Ezra got up and made the leading priests and Levites and all Israel take an oath to carry out this plan. And they all took a solemn oath. 
<bqverse 6>6 Then Ezra got up from before the temple of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he stayed<a name="fnB202" href="ezr_note.htm#fn202"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> there, he did not eat food, nor did he drink water, for he was in mourning over the infidelity of the exiles.<p>

<bqverse 7>7 A proclamation<a name="fnB203" href="ezr_note.htm#fn203"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> was circulated<a name="fnB204" href="ezr_note.htm#fn204"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> throughout Judah and Jerusalem that all the exiles were to be assembled in Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 8>8 Everyone who did not come within three days would thereby forfeit all his property, in keeping with the counsel of the officials and the elders. Furthermore, he himself would be excluded from the assembly of the exiles.<p>

<bqverse 9>9 All the men of Judah and Benjamin were gathered in Jerusalem within the three days. (It was in the ninth month, on the twentieth day of that month.) All the people sat in the square at the temple of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the rains.<p>

<bqverse 10>10 Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, "You have behaved in an unfaithful manner by taking foreign wives! This has contributed to the guilt of Israel. 
<bqverse 11>11 Now give praise to the LORD God of your fathers, and do his will. Separate yourselves from the local residents<a name="fnB205" href="ezr_note.htm#fn205"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and from these foreign wives." <p>

<bqverse 12>12 All the assembly replied in a loud voice: "We will do just as you have said!<a name="fnB206" href="ezr_note.htm#fn206"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13 However, the people are numerous and it is the rainy season.<a name="fnB207" href="ezr_note.htm#fn207"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> We are unable to stand here outside. Furthermore, this business cannot be resolved in a day or two, for we have sinned greatly in this matter. 
<bqverse 14>14 Let our leaders take steps on behalf of all the assembly. Let all those in our towns who have married foreign women come at an appointed time, and with them the elders of each town and its judges, until the hot anger of our God is turned away from us in this matter." <p>

<bqverse 15>15 Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah were against this, assisted by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite. 
<bqverse 16>16 So the exiles proceeded accordingly. Ezra the priest separated out<a name="fnB208" href="ezr_note.htm#fn208"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> by name men who were leaders in their family groups.<a name="fnB209" href="ezr_note.htm#fn209"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> They sat down to consider this matter on the first day of the tenth month, 
<bqverse 17>17 and on the first day of the first month they finished considering all the men who had married foreign wives. <a name="_Toc494012191"></a></p>
<p><i>Those Who Had Taken Foreign Wives</i>
<p>
<bqverse 18>18 It was determined that from the descendants of the priests, the following had taken foreign wives: from the descendants of Jeshua son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah. 
<bqverse 19>19 (They gave their word<a name="fnB210" href="ezr_note.htm#fn210"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> to send away their wives; their guilt offering was a ram from the flock for their guilt.) <p>
