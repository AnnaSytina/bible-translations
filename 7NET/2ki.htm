<a name="_Toc494012005"></a><p><i>Elijah Confronts the King and His Commanders</i>
<p><A NAME="1"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> After Ahab died, Moab rebelled against Israel.<a name="fnB0" href="2ki_note.htm#fn0"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  Ahaziah fell through a window lattice in his upper chamber in Samaria and was injured. He sent messengers with these orders,<a name="fnB1" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> "Go, ask<a name="fnB2" href="2ki_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> Baal Zebub,<a name="fnB3" href="2ki_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> the god of Ekron, if I will survive this injury."<p>

<bqverse 3>3  Now the LORD's angelic messenger told Elijah the Tishbite, "Arise and go up to meet the messengers from the king of Samaria. Say this to them: `You must think there is no God in Israel! That explains why you are on your way to seek an oracle from Baal Zebub the god of Ekron.<a name="fnB4" href="2ki_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  Therefore this is what the LORD says, "You will not leave the bed on which you lie, for you will certainly die."'" So Elijah went on his way.<p>

<bqverse 5>5  When the messengers returned to the king,<a name="fnB5" href="2ki_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> he asked them, "Why have you returned?" 
<bqverse 6>6  They said to him, "A man came up to meet us. He told us, "Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, `This is what the LORD says, "You must think there is no God in Israel! That explains why you are sending for an oracle from Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron.<a name="fnB6" href="2ki_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> Therefore you will not leave the bed on which you lie, for you will certainly die."'' 
<bqverse 7>7  The king<a name="fnB7" href="2ki_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> asked them, "Describe the appearance<a name="fnB8" href="2ki_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> of this man who came up to meet you and told you these things." 
<bqverse 8>8  They said to him, "He was a hairy man<a name="fnB9" href="2ki_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and had a leather belt<a name="fnB10" href="2ki_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> tied around his waist." The king<a name="fnB11" href="2ki_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> said, "He is Elijah the Tishbite."<p>

<bqverse 9>9  The king<a name="fnB12" href="2ki_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> sent a captain and his fifty soldiers<a name="fnB13" href="2ki_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> to retrieve Elijah.<a name="fnB14" href="2ki_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> The captain<a name="fnB15" href="2ki_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> went up to him, while he was sitting on the top of a hill.<a name="fnB16" href="2ki_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> He told him, "Prophet,<a name="fnB17" href="2ki_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> the king says, `Come down!'" 
<bqverse 10>10  Elijah replied to the captain,<a name="fnB18" href="2ki_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> "If I am indeed a prophet, may fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty soldiers!" Fire then came down<a name="fnB19" href="2ki_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> from the sky and consumed him and his fifty soldiers.<p>

<bqverse 11>11  The king<a name="fnB20" href="2ki_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> sent another captain and his fifty soldiers to retrieve Elijah. He went up and told him,<a name="fnB21" href="2ki_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> "Prophet, this is what the king says, `Come down at once!'"<a name="fnB22" href="2ki_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  Elijah replied to them,<a name="fnB23" href="2ki_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> "If I am indeed a prophet, may fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty soldiers!" Fire from God<a name="fnB24" href="2ki_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> came down from the sky and consumed him and his fifty soldiers.<p>

<bqverse 13>13  The king<a name="fnB25" href="2ki_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> sent a third captain and his fifty soldiers. This third captain went up and fell<a name="fnB26" href="2ki_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> on his knees before Elijah. He begged for mercy, "Prophet, please have respect for my life and for the lives of these fifty servants of yours. 
<bqverse 14>14  Indeed,<a name="fnB27" href="2ki_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> fire came down from the sky and consumed the two captains who came before me, along with their men.<a name="fnB28" href="2ki_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> So now, please have respect for my life." 
<bqverse 15>15  The LORD's angelic messenger said to Elijah, "Go down with him. Don't be afraid of him." So he got up and went down<a name="fnB29" href="2ki_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> with him to the king.<p>

<bqverse 16>16  Elijah<a name="fnB30" href="2ki_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> said to the king,<a name="fnB31" href="2ki_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> "This is what the LORD says, `You sent messengers to seek an oracle from Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron. You must think there is no God in Israel from whom you can seek an oracle.<a name="fnB32" href="2ki_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> Therefore you will not leave the bed on which you lie, for you will certainly die.'"<a name="fnB33" href="2ki_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 17>17  He died just as the LORD had prophesied through Elijah.<a name="fnB34" href="2ki_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> In the second year of the reign of King Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, over Judah, Ahaziah's brother Jehoram replaced him as king of Israel, because he had no son.<a name="fnB35" href="2ki_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  The rest of the events of Ahaziah's reign, including his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.<a name="fnB36" href="2ki_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Elijah Makes a Swift Departure</i>
<p><A NAME="2"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Just before<a name="fnB37" href="2ki_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD took Elijah up to heaven in a windstorm, Elijah and Elisha were traveling from Gilgal. 
<bqverse 2>2  Elijah told Elisha, "Stay here, for the LORD has sent me to Bethel." But Elisha said, "As certainly as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So they went down to Bethel. 
<bqverse 3>3  Some members of the prophetic guild<a name="fnB38" href="2ki_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> in Bethel came out to Elisha and said, "Do you know that today the LORD is going to take your master from you?"<a name="fnB39" href="2ki_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> He answered, "Yes, I know. Be quiet."<p>

<bqverse 4>4  Elijah said to him, "Elisha, stay here, for the LORD has sent me to Jericho." But he replied, "As certainly as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So they went to Jericho. 
<bqverse 5>5  Some members of the prophetic guild in Jericho approached Elisha and said, "Do you know that today the LORD is going to take your master from you?" He answered, "Yes, I know. Be quiet."<p>

<bqverse 6>6  Elijah said to him, "Stay here, for the LORD has sent me to the Jordan." But he replied, "As certainly as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So they traveled on together. 
<bqverse 7>7  The fifty members of the prophetic guild went and stood opposite them at a distance, while Elijah and Elisha<a name="fnB40" href="2ki_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> stood by the Jordan. 
<bqverse 8>8  Elijah took his robe, folded it up, and hit the water with it. The water divided, and the two of them crossed over on dry ground. <p>

<bqverse 9>9  When they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, "What can I do for you,<a name="fnB41" href="2ki_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> before I am taken away from you?" Elisha answered, "May I receive a double portion of the prophetic spirit that energizes you."<a name="fnB42" href="2ki_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  Elijah<a name="fnB43" href="2ki_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> replied, "That's a tall order.<a name="fnB44" href="2ki_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> If you see me taken from you, may it be so, but if you don't, it will not happen."<p>

<bqverse 11>11  As they were walking along and talking, suddenly a fiery chariot<a name="fnB45" href="2ki_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> pulled by fiery horses appeared.<a name="fnB46" href="2ki_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> They went between Elijah and Elisha,<a name="fnB47" href="2ki_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> and Elijah went up to heaven in a windstorm. 
<bqverse 12>12  While Elisha was watching, he was crying out, "My father, my father! The chariot and horsemen of Israel!"<a name="fnB48" href="2ki_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> Then he could no longer see him. He grabbed his clothes and tore them in two. 
<bqverse 13>13  He picked up Elijah's robe, which had fallen off him, and went back and stood on the shore of the Jordan. 
<bqverse 14>14  He took the robe that had fallen off Elijah,<a name="fnB49" href="2ki_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> hit the water with it, and said, "Where is the LORD God of Elijah?" When he hit the water, it divided and Elisha crossed over.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  When the members of the prophetic guild in Jericho, who were standing at a distance,<a name="fnB50" href="2ki_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> saw him do this, they said, "The spirit that energized Elijah<a name="fnB51" href="2ki_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> rests upon Elisha." They went to meet him and bowed down to the ground before him. 
<bqverse 16>16  They said to him, "Look, there are fifty capable men with your servants. Let them go and look for your master, for the wind sent from the LORD<a name="fnB52" href="2ki_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> may have carried him away and dropped him on one of the hills or in one of the valleys." But he replied, "Don't send them out." 
<bqverse 17>17  But they were so insistent, he became embarrassed. So he said, "Send them out." They sent the fifty men out and they looked for three days, but could not find him. 
<bqverse 18>18  When they came back, he was staying in Jericho. He said to them, "Didn't I tell you, `Don't go'?"<a name="_Toc494012007"></a></p>
<p><i>Elisha Demonstrates His Authority</i>
<p>
<bqverse 19>19  The men of the city said to Elisha, "Look, the city has a good location, as our<a name="fnB53" href="2ki_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> master can see. But the water is bad and the land doesn't produce crops."<a name="fnB54" href="2ki_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  Elisha<a name="fnB55" href="2ki_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> said, "Get me a new jar and put some salt in it." So they got it. 
<bqverse 21>21  He went out to the spring and threw the salt in. Then he said, "This is what the LORD says, `I have purified<a name="fnB56" href="2ki_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> this water. It will no longer cause death or fail to produce crops."<a name="fnB57" href="2ki_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  The water has been pure to this very day, just as Elisha prophesied.<a name="fnB58" href="2ki_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 23>23  He went up from there to Bethel. As he was traveling up the road, some young boys<a name="fnB59" href="2ki_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> came out of the city and made fun of him, saying, "Go on up, baldy! Go on up, baldy!" 
<bqverse 24>24  When he turned around and saw them, he called God's judgment down on them.<a name="fnB60" href="2ki_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> Two female bears came out of the woods and ripped forty-two of the boys to pieces. 
<bqverse 25>25  From there he traveled to Mount Carmel and then back to Samaria.<a name="fnB61" href="2ki_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqchapter 3>
<a name="_Toc494012008"></a></p>
<p><i>Moab Fights with Israel </i>
<p><A NAME="3"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> In the eighteenth year of King Jehoshaphat's reign over Judah, Ahab's son Jehoram became king over Israel in Samaria; he ruled for twelve years. 
<bqverse 2>2  He did evil before<a name="fnB62" href="2ki_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD, but not to the same degree as his father and mother. He did remove the sacred pillar of Baal that his father had made. 
<bqverse 3>3  Yet he persisted in<a name="fnB63" href="2ki_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who encouraged Israel to sin; he did not turn from them.<a name="fnB64" href="2ki_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 4>4  Now King Mesha of Moab was a sheep-breeder.<a name="fnB65" href="2ki_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> He would send as tribute<a name="fnB66" href="2ki_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> to the king of Israel one hundred thousand male lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand rams. 
<bqverse 5>5  When Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. 
<bqverse 6>6  At that time King Jehoram left Samaria and assembled all Israel for war. 
<bqverse 7>7  He sent<a name="fnB67" href="2ki_note.htm#fn67"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> this message to King Jehoshaphat of Judah: "The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you fight with me against Moab?" Jehoshaphat<a name="fnB68" href="2ki_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> replied, "I will join you in the campaign; my army and horses are at your disposal."<a name="fnB69" href="2ki_note.htm#fn69"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  He then asked, "Which invasion route are we going to take?"<a name="fnB70" href="2ki_note.htm#fn70"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> Jehoram<a name="fnB71" href="2ki_note.htm#fn71"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> answered, "By the road through the Desert of Edom." 
<bqverse 9>9  So the kings of Israel, Judah, and Edom<a name="fnB72" href="2ki_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> set out together. They wandered around on the road for seven days and finally ran out of water for the men and animals they had with them. 
<bqverse 10>10  The king of Israel said, "Oh no!<a name="fnB73" href="2ki_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> Certainly the LORD has summoned these three kings so that he can hand them over to the king of Moab!" 
<bqverse 11>11  Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there no prophet of the LORD here that we might seek the LORD's direction?"<a name="fnB74" href="2ki_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> One of the servants of the king of Israel answered, "Elisha son of Shapat is here; he used to be Elijah's servant."<a name="fnB75" href="2ki_note.htm#fn75"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  Jehoshaphat said, "The LORD speaks through him."<a name="fnB76" href="2ki_note.htm#fn76"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> So the king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went down to visit him. <p>

<bqverse 13>13  Elisha said to the king of Israel, "Why are you here?<a name="fnB77" href="2ki_note.htm#fn77"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> Go to your father's prophets or your mother's prophets!" The king of Israel replied to him, "No, for the LORD is the one who summoned these three kings so that he can hand them over to Moab." 
<bqverse 14>14  Elisha said, "As certainly as the sovereign LORD<a name="fnB78" href="2ki_note.htm#fn78"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> lives (whom I serve),<a name="fnB79" href="2ki_note.htm#fn79"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> if I did not respect King Jehoshaphat of Judah,<a name="fnB80" href="2ki_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> I would not pay attention to you or acknowledge you."<a name="fnB81" href="2ki_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  But now, get me a musician."<a name="fnB82" href="2ki_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> When the musician played, the LORD energized him,<a name="fnB83" href="2ki_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  and he said, "This is what the LORD says, `Make many cisterns in this valley,'<a name="fnB84" href="2ki_note.htm#fn84"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  for this is what the LORD says, `You will not feel<a name="fnB85" href="2ki_note.htm#fn85"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> any wind or see any rain, but this valley will be full of water and you and your cattle and animals will drink.' 
<bqverse 18>18  This is an easy task for the LORD;<a name="fnB86" href="2ki_note.htm#fn86"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> he will also hand Moab over to you. 
<bqverse 19>19  You will defeat every fortified and every important<a name="fnB87" href="2ki_note.htm#fn87"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> city. You must chop down<a name="fnB88" href="2ki_note.htm#fn88"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> every productive<a name="fnB89" href="2ki_note.htm#fn89"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> tree, stop up all the springs, and cover all the cultivated land with stones."<a name="fnB90" href="2ki_note.htm#fn90"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 20>20  Sure enough, the next morning, at the time of the morning sacrifice, water came flowing down from Edom and filled the land.<a name="fnB91" href="2ki_note.htm#fn91"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  Now all Moab had heard that the kings were attacking,<a name="fnB92" href="2ki_note.htm#fn92"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> so everyone old enough to fight was mustered and placed at the border.<a name="fnB93" href="2ki_note.htm#fn93"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  When they got up early the next morning, the sun was shining on the water. To the Moabites, who were some distance away, the water looked red like blood. 
<bqverse 23>23  The Moabites<a name="fnB94" href="2ki_note.htm#fn94"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> said, "It's blood! The kings are totally destroyed.<a name="fnB95" href="2ki_note.htm#fn95"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> They have struck one another down. Now, Moab, grab the plunder!" 
<bqverse 24>24  When they approached the Israelite camp, the Israelites rose up and struck down the Moabites, who then ran from them. The Israelites<a name="fnB96" href="2ki_note.htm#fn96"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> thoroughly defeated<a name="fnB97" href="2ki_note.htm#fn97"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> Moab. 
<bqverse 25>25  They tore down the cities and each man threw a stone into every cultivated field until they were covered.<a name="fnB98" href="2ki_note.htm#fn98"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> They stopped up every spring and chopped down every productive tree. <p>
Only Kir Hareseth was left intact,<a name="fnB99" href="2ki_note.htm#fn99"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> but the slingers surrounded it and attacked it. 
<bqverse 26>26  When the king of Moab realized he was losing the battle,<a name="fnB100" href="2ki_note.htm#fn100"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> he and seven hundred swordsmen tried to break through and attack<a name="fnB101" href="2ki_note.htm#fn101"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> the king of Edom, but they failed. 
<bqverse 27>27  So he took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him up as a burnt sacrifice on the wall. There was an outburst of divine anger against Israel,<a name="fnB102" href="2ki_note.htm#fn102"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> so they broke off the attack<a name="fnB103" href="2ki_note.htm#fn103"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> and returned to their homeland.

<p><i>Elisha Helps a Widow and Her Sons</i>
<p><A NAME="4"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Now a wife of one of the prophets<a name="fnB104" href="2ki_note.htm#fn104"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> appealed<a name="fnB105" href="2ki_note.htm#fn105"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> to Elisha for help, saying, "Your servant, my husband is dead. You know that your servant was a loyal follower of the LORD.<a name="fnB106" href="2ki_note.htm#fn106"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> Now the creditor is coming to take away my two boys to be his servants." 
<bqverse 2>2  Elisha said to her, "What can I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?" She answered, "Your servant has nothing in the house except a small jar of oil." 
<bqverse 3>3  He said, "Go and ask all your neighbors for empty containers.<a name="fnB107" href="2ki_note.htm#fn107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> Get as many as you can.<a name="fnB108" href="2ki_note.htm#fn108"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  Go and close the door behind you and your sons. Pour the oil into all the containers;<a name="fnB109" href="2ki_note.htm#fn109"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> set aside each one when you have filled it." 
<bqverse 5>5  So she left him and closed the door behind her and her sons. As they were bringing the containers to her, she was pouring the oil. 
<bqverse 6>6  When the containers were full, she said to one of her sons,<a name="fnB110" href="2ki_note.htm#fn110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> "Bring me another container." But he answered her, "There are no more." Then the oil stopped flowing. 
<bqverse 7>7  She went and told the prophet.<a name="fnB111" href="2ki_note.htm#fn111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> He said, "Go, sell the oil. Repay your creditor, and then you and your sons can live off the rest of the profit."<a name="_Toc494012010"></a></p>
<p><i>Elisha Gives Life to a Boy</i>
<p>
<bqverse 8>8  One day Elisha traveled to Shunem, where a respected<a name="fnB112" href="2ki_note.htm#fn112"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> woman lived. She insisted that he stop for a meal.<a name="fnB113" href="2ki_note.htm#fn113"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> So whenever he was passing through, he would stop in there for a meal.<a name="fnB114" href="2ki_note.htm#fn114"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  She said to her husband, "Look, I'm sure<a name="fnB115" href="2ki_note.htm#fn115"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> that the man who regularly passes through here is a very special prophet.<a name="fnB116" href="2ki_note.htm#fn116"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  Let's make a small private upper room<a name="fnB117" href="2ki_note.htm#fn117"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> and furnish it with<a name="fnB118" href="2ki_note.htm#fn118"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> a bed, table, chair and lamp. When he visits us, he can stay there."<p>

<bqverse 11>11  One day Elisha<a name="fnB119" href="2ki_note.htm#fn119"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> came for a visit; he went<a name="fnB120" href="2ki_note.htm#fn120"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> into the upper room and rested.<a name="fnB121" href="2ki_note.htm#fn121"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  He told his servant Gehazi, "Ask the Shunammite woman to come here."<a name="fnB122" href="2ki_note.htm#fn122"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> So he did so and she came to him.<a name="fnB123" href="2ki_note.htm#fn123"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  Elisha said to Gehazi,<a name="fnB124" href="2ki_note.htm#fn124"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> "Tell her, `Look, you have treated us with such great respect.<a name="fnB125" href="2ki_note.htm#fn125"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> What can I do for you? Can I put in a good word for you with the king or the commander of the army?'" She replied, "I'm quite secure."<a name="fnB126" href="2ki_note.htm#fn126"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  So he asked Gehazi,<a name="fnB127" href="2ki_note.htm#fn127"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> "What can I do for her?" Gehazi replied, "She has no son, and her husband is old." 
<bqverse 15>15  Elisha told him, "Ask her to come here."<a name="fnB128" href="2ki_note.htm#fn128"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> So he did so<a name="fnB129" href="2ki_note.htm#fn129"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> and she came and stood in the doorway.<a name="fnB130" href="2ki_note.htm#fn130"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  He said, "About this time next year<a name="fnB131" href="2ki_note.htm#fn131"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> you will be holding a son." She said, "No, my master! O prophet, do not lie to your servant!" 
<bqverse 17>17  The woman did conceive, and at the specified time the next year she gave birth to a son, just as Elisha had told her.<p>

<bqverse 18>18  The boy grew and one day he went out to see his father who was with the harvesters.<a name="fnB132" href="2ki_note.htm#fn132"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  He said to his father, "My head! My head!" His father<a name="fnB133" href="2ki_note.htm#fn133"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> told a servant, "Carry him to his mother." 
<bqverse 20>20  So he picked him up and took him to his mother. He sat on her lap<a name="fnB134" href="2ki_note.htm#fn134"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> until noon and then died. 
<bqverse 21>21  She went up and laid him down on the prophet's<a name="fnB135" href="2ki_note.htm#fn135"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> bed. She shut the door behind her and left. 
<bqverse 22>22  She called to her husband, "Send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, so I can go see the prophet quickly and then return." 
<bqverse 23>23  He said, "Why do you want to go see him today? It is not the new moon<a name="fnB136" href="2ki_note.htm#fn136"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> or the Sabbath." She said, "Everything's fine."<a name="fnB137" href="2ki_note.htm#fn137"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  She saddled the donkey and told her servant, "Lead on.<a name="fnB138" href="2ki_note.htm#fn138"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> Do not stop unless I say so."<a name="fnB139" href="2ki_note.htm#fn139"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 25>25  So she went to visit<a name="fnB140" href="2ki_note.htm#fn140"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> the prophet at Mount Carmel. When he<a name="fnB141" href="2ki_note.htm#fn141"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> saw her at a distance, he said to his servant Gehazi, "Look, it's the Shunammite woman. 
<bqverse 26>26  Now, run to meet her and ask her, `Are you well? Are your husband and the boy well?'" She told Gehazi,<a name="fnB142" href="2ki_note.htm#fn142"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> "Everything's fine." 
<bqverse 27>27  But when she reached the prophet on the mountain, she grabbed hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to push her away, but the prophet said, "Leave her alone, for she is very upset.<a name="fnB143" href="2ki_note.htm#fn143"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> The LORD has kept the matter hidden from me; he didn't tell me about it.<sup>"</sup> 
<bqverse 28>28  She said, "Did I ask my master for a son? Didn't I say, `Don't mislead me?'" 
<bqverse 29>29  Elisha<a name="fnB144" href="2ki_note.htm#fn144"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> told Gehazi, "Tuck your robes into your belt, grab my staff,<a name="fnB145" href="2ki_note.htm#fn145"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> and go. Don't stop to exchange greetings with anyone.<a name="fnB146" href="2ki_note.htm#fn146"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> Place my staff on the child's face." 
<bqverse 30>30  The mother of the child said, "As certainly as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So he got up and followed her back. <p>

<bqverse 31>31  Now Gehazi went on ahead of them. He placed the staff on the child's face, but there was no sound or response. When he came back to Elisha<a name="fnB147" href="2ki_note.htm#fn147"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> he told him, "The child did not wake up." 
<bqverse 32>32  When Elisha arrived at the house, there was<a name="fnB148" href="2ki_note.htm#fn148"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> the child lying dead on his bed. 
<bqverse 33>33  He went in by himself and closed the door.<a name="fnB149" href="2ki_note.htm#fn149"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> Then he prayed to the LORD. 
<bqverse 34>34  He got up on the bed and spread his body out over<a name="fnB150" href="2ki_note.htm#fn150"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> the boy; he put his mouth on the boy's<a name="fnB151" href="2ki_note.htm#fn151"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> mouth, his eyes over the boy's eyes, and the palms of his hands against the boy's palms. He bent down over him, and the boy's skin<a name="fnB152" href="2ki_note.htm#fn152"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> grew warm. 
<bqverse 35>35  Elisha<a name="fnB153" href="2ki_note.htm#fn153"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> went back and walked around in the house.<a name="fnB154" href="2ki_note.htm#fn154"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> Then he got up on the bed again<a name="fnB155" href="2ki_note.htm#fn155"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> and bent down over him. The child sneezed seven times and opened his eyes. 
<bqverse 36>36  Elisha<a name="fnB156" href="2ki_note.htm#fn156"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> called to Gehazi and said, "Get the Shunammite woman." So he did so<a name="fnB157" href="2ki_note.htm#fn157"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> and she came to him. He said to her, "Pick up your son." 
<bqverse 37>37  She came in, fell at his feet, and bowed down. Then she picked up her son and left.<a name="_Toc494012011"></a></p>
<p><i>Elisha Makes a Meal Edible</i>
<p>
<bqverse 38>38  Now Elisha went back to Gilgal, while there was famine in the land. Some of the prophets were visiting him<a name="fnB158" href="2ki_note.htm#fn158"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> and he told his servant, "Put the big pot on the fire<a name="fnB159" href="2ki_note.htm#fn159"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> and boil some stew for the prophets."<a name="fnB160" href="2ki_note.htm#fn160"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 39>39  Someone went out to the field to gather some herbs and found a wild vine.<a name="fnB161" href="2ki_note.htm#fn161"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> He picked some of its fruit,<a name="fnB162" href="2ki_note.htm#fn162"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> enough to fill up the fold of his robe. He came back, cut it up, and threw the slices<a name="fnB163" href="2ki_note.htm#fn163"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> into the stew pot, not knowing they were harmful.<a name="fnB164" href="2ki_note.htm#fn164"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 40>40  The stew was poured out<a name="fnB165" href="2ki_note.htm#fn165"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> for the men to eat. When they ate some of the stew, they cried out, "Death is in the pot, O prophet!" They could not eat it. 
<bqverse 41>41  He said, "Get some flour." Then he threw it into the pot and said, "Now pour some out for the men so they may eat."<a name="fnB166" href="2ki_note.htm#fn166"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> There was no longer anything harmful in the pot.<a name="_Toc494012012"></a></p>
<p><i>Elisha Miraculously Feeds a Hundred People</i>
<p>
<bqverse 42>42  Now a man from Baal Shalisha brought some food for the prophet<a name="fnB167" href="2ki_note.htm#fn167"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a>--twenty loaves of bread made from the firstfruits of the barley harvest, as well as fresh ears of grain.<a name="fnB168" href="2ki_note.htm#fn168"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> Elisha<a name="fnB169" href="2ki_note.htm#fn169"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a> said, "Set it before the people so they may eat." 
<bqverse 43>43  But his attendant said, "How can I feed a hundred men with this?"<a name="fnB170" href="2ki_note.htm#fn170"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> He replied, "Set it before the people so they may eat, for this is what the LORD says, `They will eat and have some left over.'"<a name="fnB171" href="2ki_note.htm#fn171"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 44>44  So he set it before them; they ate and had some left over, just as the LORD predicted.<a name="fnB172" href="2ki_note.htm#fn172"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>69</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqchapter 5>
<a name="_Toc494012013"></a></p>
<p><i>Elisha Heals a Syrian General </i>
<p><A NAME="5"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Now Naaman, the commander of the army of the king of Syria, was esteemed and respected by his master,<a name="fnB173" href="2ki_note.htm#fn173"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> for through him the LORD had given Syria military victories. But this great warrior had a skin disease.<a name="fnB174" href="2ki_note.htm#fn174"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  Raiding parties went out from Syria and took captive from the land of Israel a young girl, who became a servant to Naaman's wife. 
<bqverse 3>3  She told her mistress, "If only my master were in the presence of the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would cure him of his skin disease."<p>

<bqverse 4>4  Naaman<a name="fnB175" href="2ki_note.htm#fn175"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> went and told his master what the girl from the land of Israel had said. 
<bqverse 5>5  The king of Syria said, "Go! I will send a letter to the king of Israel." So he went, taking with him ten units<a name="fnB176" href="2ki_note.htm#fn176"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> of silver, six thousand shekels of gold,<a name="fnB177" href="2ki_note.htm#fn177"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and ten suits of clothes. 
<bqverse 6>6  He brought the letter to king of Israel. It said, "This is a letter of introduction for my servant Naaman,<a name="fnB178" href="2ki_note.htm#fn178"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> whom I have sent to be cured of his skin disease." 
<bqverse 7>7  When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, "Am I God? Can I kill or restore life? Why does he ask me to cure a man of his skin disease?<a name="fnB179" href="2ki_note.htm#fn179"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> Certainly you must see that he is looking for an excuse to fight me."<a name="fnB180" href="2ki_note.htm#fn180"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 8>8  When Elisha the prophet<a name="fnB181" href="2ki_note.htm#fn181"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> heard that the king had torn his clothes, he sent this message to the king, "Why did you tear your clothes? Send him<a name="fnB182" href="2ki_note.htm#fn182"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> to me so he may know there is a prophet in Israel." 
<bqverse 9>9  So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stood in the doorway of Elisha's house. 
<bqverse 10>10  Elisha sent out a messenger who told him, "Go and wash seven times in the Jordan; your skin will be restored<a name="fnB183" href="2ki_note.htm#fn183"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> and you will be healed." 
<bqverse 11>11  Naaman went away angry. He said: "Look, I thought for sure he would come out, stand there, invoke the name of the LORD his God, wave his hand over the area, and cure the skin disease. 
<bqverse 12>12  The rivers of Damascus, the Abana and Pharpar, are better than any of the waters of Israel.<a name="fnB184" href="2ki_note.htm#fn184"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> Could I not wash in them and be healed?" So he turned around and went away angry. 
<bqverse 13>13  His servants approached and said to him, "O master,<a name="fnB185" href="2ki_note.htm#fn185"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> if the prophet had told you to do some difficult task,<a name="fnB186" href="2ki_note.htm#fn186"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> you would have been willing to do it.<a name="fnB187" href="2ki_note.htm#fn187"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> It seems you would be happy that he simply said, "Wash and you will be healed."<a name="fnB188" href="2ki_note.htm#fn188"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  So he went down and dipped in the Jordan seven times, as the prophet had instructed.<a name="fnB189" href="2ki_note.htm#fn189"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> His skin became as smooth as a young child's<a name="fnB190" href="2ki_note.htm#fn190"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and he was healed.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  He and his entire entourage returned to the prophet. Naaman<a name="fnB191" href="2ki_note.htm#fn191"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> came and stood before him. He said, "For sure<a name="fnB192" href="2ki_note.htm#fn192"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> I know that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel. Now, please accept a gift from your servant." 
<bqverse 16>16  But Elisha<a name="fnB193" href="2ki_note.htm#fn193"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> replied, "As certainly as the LORD lives (whom I serve),<a name="fnB194" href="2ki_note.htm#fn194"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> I will take nothing from you." Naaman<a name="fnB195" href="2ki_note.htm#fn195"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> insisted that he take it, but he refused. 
<bqverse 17>17  Naaman said, "If not, then please give your servant a load of dirt, enough for a pair of mules to carry,<a name="fnB196" href="2ki_note.htm#fn196"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> for your servant will never again offer a burnt offering or sacrifice to a god other than the LORD.<a name="fnB197" href="2ki_note.htm#fn197"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  May the LORD forgive your servant for this: When my master enters the temple of Rimmon to worship, and he leans on my arm and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the LORD forgive your servant for this."<a name="fnB198" href="2ki_note.htm#fn198"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  Elisha<a name="fnB199" href="2ki_note.htm#fn199"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> said to him, "Go in peace." <p>

<bqverse 20>20  Gehazi, the prophet Elisha's servant, thought,<a name="fnB201" href="2ki_note.htm#fn201"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> "Look, my master did not accept what this Syrian Naaman offered him.<a name="fnB202" href="2ki_note.htm#fn202"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> As certainly as the LORD lives, I will run after him and accept something from him." 
<bqverse 21>21  So Gehazi ran after Naaman. When Naaman saw someone running after him, he got down from his chariot to meet him and asked, "Is everything okay?"<a name="fnB203" href="2ki_note.htm#fn203"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  He answered, "Everything is fine.<a name="fnB204" href="2ki_note.htm#fn204"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> My master sent me with this message, `Look, two servants of the prophets just arrived from the Ephraimite hill country.<a name="fnB205" href="2ki_note.htm#fn205"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> Please give them a unit<a name="fnB206" href="2ki_note.htm#fn206"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> of silver and two suits of clothes.'" 
<bqverse 23>23  Naaman said, "Please accept two units of silver.<a name="fnB207" href="2ki_note.htm#fn207"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> He insisted and tied up two units of silver in two bags, along with two suits of clothes. He gave them to two of his servants and they carried them for Gehazi.<a name="fnB208" href="2ki_note.htm#fn208"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  When he arrived at the hill, he took them from the servants<a name="fnB209" href="2ki_note.htm#fn209"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> and put them in the house. Then he sent the men on their way.<a name="fnB210" href="2ki_note.htm#fn210"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 25>25  When he came and stood before his master, Elisha asked him, "Where have you been, Gehazi?" He answered, "Your servant hasn't been anywhere." 
<bqverse 26>26  Elisha<a name="fnB211" href="2ki_note.htm#fn211"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> replied, "I was there in spirit when a man turned and got down from his chariot to meet you.<a name="fnB212" href="2ki_note.htm#fn212"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> This is not the proper time to accept silver or to accept clothes, olive groves, vineyards, sheep, cattle, and male and female servants.<a name="fnB213" href="2ki_note.htm#fn213"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  Therefore Naaman's skin disease will afflict<a name="fnB214" href="2ki_note.htm#fn214"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> you and your offspring forever." When Gehazi<a name="fnB215" href="2ki_note.htm#fn215"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> went out from his presence, his skin was as white as snow.<a name="fnB216" href="2ki_note.htm#fn216"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Elisha Makes an Ax Head Float</i>
<p><A NAME="6"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Some of the prophets<a name="fnB217" href="2ki_note.htm#fn217"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> said to Elisha, "Look, the place where we meet with you<a name="fnB218" href="2ki_note.htm#fn218"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> is too cramped<a name="fnB219" href="2ki_note.htm#fn219"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> for us. 
<bqverse 2>2  Let's go to the Jordan. Each of us will grab a log from there and we will build a meeting place for ourselves there." He said, "Go." 
<bqverse 3>3  One of them said, "Please come along with your servants." He replied, "All right, I'll come." 
<bqverse 4>4  So he went with them. When they arrived at the Jordan, they started cutting down trees. 
<bqverse 5>5  As one of them was felling a log, the ax head<a name="fnB220" href="2ki_note.htm#fn220"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> dropped into the water. He yelled out, "Oh no,<a name="fnB221" href="2ki_note.htm#fn221"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> my master! It was borrowed." 
<bqverse 6>6  The prophet<a name="fnB222" href="2ki_note.htm#fn222"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> asked, "Where did it drop in?" When he showed him the spot, Elisha<a name="fnB223" href="2ki_note.htm#fn223"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> cut off a branch, threw it in at that spot, and made the ax head float. 
<bqverse 7>7  He said, "Lift it out." So he reached out his hand and grabbed it.<a name="_Toc494012015"></a></p>
<p><i>Elisha Defeats an Army</i>
<p>
<bqverse 8>8  Now the king of Syria was at war with Israel. He consulted his advisers, who said, "Invade<a name="fnB224" href="2ki_note.htm#fn224"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> at such and such<a name="fnB225" href="2ki_note.htm#fn225"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> a place." 
<bqverse 9>9  But the prophet sent this message to the king of Israel, "Make sure you don't pass through this place because Syria is invading there." 
<bqverse 10>10  So the king of Israel sent a message to the place the prophet had pointed out, warning it<a name="fnB226" href="2ki_note.htm#fn226"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> to be on its guard. This happened on several occasions.<a name="fnB227" href="2ki_note.htm#fn227"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  This made the king of Syria upset.<a name="fnB228" href="2ki_note.htm#fn228"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> So he summoned his advisers<a name="fnB229" href="2ki_note.htm#fn229"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> and said to them, "One of us must be helping the king of Israel."<a name="fnB230" href="2ki_note.htm#fn230"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  One of his advisers said, "No, my master, O king. The prophet Elisha who lives in Israel keeps telling the king of Israel the things you say in your bedroom." 
<bqverse 13>13  The king<a name="fnB231" href="2ki_note.htm#fn231"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> ordered, "Go, find out where he is, so I can send some men to capture him."<a name="fnB232" href="2ki_note.htm#fn232"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> The king was told, "He is in Dothan." 
<bqverse 14>14  So he sent horses and chariots there, along with a good-sized army.<a name="fnB233" href="2ki_note.htm#fn233"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> They arrived during the night and surrounded the city.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  The prophet's<a name="fnB234" href="2ki_note.htm#fn234"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> attendant got up early in the morning. When he went outside there was an army surrounding the city, along with horses and chariots. He said to Elisha,<a name="fnB235" href="2ki_note.htm#fn235"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> "Oh no, my master! What will we do?" 
<bqverse 16>16  He replied, "Don't be afraid, for our side outnumbers them."<a name="fnB236" href="2ki_note.htm#fn236"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  Then Elisha prayed, "O LORD, open his eyes so he can see." The LORD opened the servant's eyes and he saw that<a name="fnB237" href="2ki_note.htm#fn237"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> the hill was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha. 
<bqverse 18>18  As they approached him,<a name="fnB238" href="2ki_note.htm#fn238"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> Elisha prayed to the LORD, "Strike these people<a name="fnB239" href="2ki_note.htm#fn239"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> with blindness."<a name="fnB240" href="2ki_note.htm#fn240"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> The LORD<a name="fnB241" href="2ki_note.htm#fn241"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> struck them with blindness as Elisha requested.<a name="fnB242" href="2ki_note.htm#fn242"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  Then Elisha said to them, "This is not the right road or city. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you're looking for." He led them to Samaria. <p>

<bqverse 20>20  When they had entered Samaria, Elisha said, "O LORD, open their eyes, so they can see." The LORD opened their eyes and they saw that they were in the middle of Samaria.<a name="fnB243" href="2ki_note.htm#fn243"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  When the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, "Should I strike them down,<a name="fnB244" href="2ki_note.htm#fn244"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> my master?"<a name="fnB245" href="2ki_note.htm#fn245"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  He replied, "Do not strike them down. You did not capture them with your sword or bow, so what gives you the freedom to strike them down?<a name="fnB246" href="2ki_note.htm#fn246"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> Give them some food and water, so they can eat and drink and then go back to their master." 
<bqverse 23>23  So he threw a big banquet<a name="fnB247" href="2ki_note.htm#fn247"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> for them and they ate and drank. Then he sent them back<a name="fnB248" href="2ki_note.htm#fn248"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> to their master. After that no Syrian raiding parties again invaded the land of Israel.<a name="_Toc494012016"></a></p>
<p><i>The Lord Saves Samaria</i>
<p>
<bqverse 24>24  Later King Ben Hadad of Syria assembled his entire army and attacked<a name="fnB249" href="2ki_note.htm#fn249"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> and besieged Samaria. 
<bqverse 25>25  Samaria's food supply ran out.<a name="fnB250" href="2ki_note.htm#fn250"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> They laid siege to it so long that<a name="fnB251" href="2ki_note.htm#fn251"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> a donkey's head was selling for eighty shekels of silver<a name="fnB252" href="2ki_note.htm#fn252"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> and a quarter of a kab<a name="fnB253" href="2ki_note.htm#fn253"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> of dove's manure<a name="fnB254" href="2ki_note.htm#fn254"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> for five shekels of silver.<a name="fnB255" href="2ki_note.htm#fn255"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 26>26  While the king of Israel was passing by on the city wall, a woman yelled to him, "Help us, my master, O king!" 
<bqverse 27>27  He replied, "No, let the LORD help you. How can I help you? The threshing floor and winepress are empty."<a name="fnB256" href="2ki_note.htm#fn256"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  Then the king asked her, "What's your problem?" She answered, "This woman said to me, `Hand over your son; we'll eat him today and then eat my son tomorrow.' 
<bqverse 29>29  So we boiled my son and ate him. Then I said to her the next day, `Hand over your son and we'll eat him.' But she hid her son." 
<bqverse 30>30  When the king heard what the woman said, he tore his clothes. As he was passing by on the wall, the people could see he was wearing sackcloth under his clothes.<a name="fnB257" href="2ki_note.htm#fn257"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 31>31  Then he said, "May God judge me severely<a name="fnB258" href="2ki_note.htm#fn258"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> if Elisha son of Shaphat still has his head by the end of the day."<a name="fnB259" href="2ki_note.htm#fn259"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 32>32  Now Elisha was sitting in his house with the community leaders.<a name="fnB260" href="2ki_note.htm#fn260"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> The king<a name="fnB261" href="2ki_note.htm#fn261"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> sent a messenger on ahead, but before he arrived,<a name="fnB262" href="2ki_note.htm#fn262"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> Elisha<a name="fnB263" href="2ki_note.htm#fn263"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> said to the leaders,<a name="fnB264" href="2ki_note.htm#fn264"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> "Do you realize this assassin intends to cut off my head?"<a name="fnB265" href="2ki_note.htm#fn265"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> Look, when the messenger arrives, shut the door and lean against it.

<bqverse 33>33  He was still talking to them when<a name="fnB267" href="2ki_note.htm#fn267"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> the messenger approached<a name="fnB268" href="2ki_note.htm#fn268"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> and said, "Look, the LORD is responsible for this disaster.<a name="fnB269" href="2ki_note.htm#fn269"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> Why should I continue to wait for the LORD to help?" 
<bqchapter 7><A NAME="7"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Elisha replied, "Hear the word of the LORD!

<bqverse 2>2  An officer who was the king's right hand man<a name="fnB271" href="2ki_note.htm#fn271"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> responded to the prophet,<a name="fnB272" href="2ki_note.htm#fn272"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> "Look, even if the LORD made it rain by opening holes in the sky, could this happen so soon?"<a name="fnB273" href="2ki_note.htm#fn273"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> Elisha<a name="fnB274" href="2ki_note.htm#fn274"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> said, "Look, you will see it happen with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of the food."<a name="fnB275" href="2ki_note.htm#fn275"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 3>3  Now four men with a skin disease<a name="fnB276" href="2ki_note.htm#fn276"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> were sitting at the entrance of the gate. They said to one another, "Why are we just sitting here waiting to die?<a name="fnB277" href="2ki_note.htm#fn277"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  If we go into the city, we'll die of starvation,<a name="fnB278" href="2ki_note.htm#fn278"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> and if we stay here we'll die.

<bqverse 5>5  So they started toward<a name="fnB282" href="2ki_note.htm#fn282"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> the Syrian camp at dusk. When they reached the edge of the Syrian camp, there was no one there. 
<bqverse 6>6  The LORD had caused the Syrian camp to hear the sound of chariots and horses and a large army. Then they said to one another, "Look, the king of Israel has paid the kings of the Hittites and Egypt to attack us." 
<bqverse 7>7  So they got up and fled at dusk, leaving behind their tents, horses and donkeys. They left the camp as it was and ran for their lives. 
<bqverse 8>8  When the men with a skin disease reached the edge of the camp, they entered a tent and had a meal.<a name="fnB283" href="2ki_note.htm#fn283"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> They also took some silver, gold, and clothes and went and hid it all.<a name="fnB284" href="2ki_note.htm#fn284"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> Then they went back and entered another tent. They looted it<a name="fnB285" href="2ki_note.htm#fn285"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> and went and hid what they had taken. 
<bqverse 9>9  Then they said to one another, "It's not right what we're doing. This is a day to celebrate, but we haven't told anyone.<a name="fnB286" href="2ki_note.htm#fn286"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> If we wait until dawn,<a name="fnB287" href="2ki_note.htm#fn287"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> we'll be punished.<a name="fnB288" href="2ki_note.htm#fn288"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> So come on, let's go and inform the royal palace." 
<bqverse 10>10  So they went and called out to the gatekeepers<a name="fnB289" href="2ki_note.htm#fn289"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> of the city. They told them, "We entered the Syrian camp and there was no one there.

<bqverse 12>12  The king got up in the night and said to his advisers,<a name="fnB293" href="2ki_note.htm#fn293"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> "I will tell you what the Syrians have done to us.

<bqverse 13>13  One of his advisers replied, "Pick some men and have them take five of the horses that are left in the city.

<bqverse 15>15  So they tracked them<a name="fnB298" href="2ki_note.htm#fn298"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> as far as the Jordan.

<bqverse 16>16  Then the people went out and looted the Syrian camp. A seah<a name="fnB301" href="2ki_note.htm#fn301"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> of finely milled flour sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, just as the LORD had said they would.<a name="fnB302" href="2ki_note.htm#fn302"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 17>17  Now the king had placed the officer who was his right hand man<a name="fnB303" href="2ki_note.htm#fn303"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> at the gate.

<bqverse 18>18  The prophet told the king, "Two seahs of barley will sell for a shekel, and a seah of finely milled flour for a seah; this will happen about this time tomorrow in the gate of Samaria." 
<bqverse 19>19  But the officer replied to the prophet, "Look, even if the LORD made it rain by opening holes in the sky, could this happen so soon?"<a name="fnB306" href="2ki_note.htm#fn306"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> Elisha<a name="fnB307" href="2ki_note.htm#fn307"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> said, "Look, you will see it happen with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of the food."<a name="fnB308" href="2ki_note.htm#fn308"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  This is exactly what happened to him. The people trampled him to death in the gate.

<p><i>Elisha Again Helps the Shunammite Woman</i>
<p><A NAME="8"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Now Elisha advised the woman whose son he had brought back to life, "You and your family should go and live somewhere else for awhile,<a name="fnB309" href="2ki_note.htm#fn309"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> for the LORD has decreed that a famine will overtake the land for seven years." 
<bqverse 2>2  So the woman did as the prophet said.<a name="fnB310" href="2ki_note.htm#fn310"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> She and her family went and lived in the land of the Philistines for seven years. 
<bqverse 3>3  After seven years the woman returned from the land of the Philistines and went to ask the king to give her back her house and field.<a name="fnB311" href="2ki_note.htm#fn311"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  Now the king was talking to Gehazi, the prophet's<a name="fnB312" href="2ki_note.htm#fn312"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> servant, and said, "Tell me all the great things which Elisha has done." 
<bqverse 5>5  While Gehazi<a name="fnB313" href="2ki_note.htm#fn313"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> was telling the king how Elisha<a name="fnB314" href="2ki_note.htm#fn314"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> had brought the dead back to life, the woman whose son he had brought back to life came to ask the king for her house and field.<a name="fnB315" href="2ki_note.htm#fn315"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> Gehazi said, "My master, O king, this is the very woman and this is her son whom Elisha brought back to life."

<p><i>Elisha Meets with Hazael</i>
<p>
<bqverse 7>7  Elisha traveled to Damascus while King Ben Hadad of Syria was sick. The king<a name="fnB318" href="2ki_note.htm#fn318"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> was told, "The prophet<a name="fnB319" href="2ki_note.htm#fn319"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> has come here." 
<bqverse 8>8  So the king told Hazael, "Take a gift<a name="fnB320" href="2ki_note.htm#fn320"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> and go visit the prophet. Request from him an oracle from the LORD. Ask him,<a name="fnB321" href="2ki_note.htm#fn321"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> `Will I recover from this sickness?'" 
<bqverse 9>9  So Hazael went to visit him. He took along a gift,<a name="fnB322" href="2ki_note.htm#fn322"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> as well as<a name="fnB323" href="2ki_note.htm#fn323"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> forty camel loads of all the fine things of Damascus. When he arrived, he stood before him and said, "Your son,<a name="fnB324" href="2ki_note.htm#fn324"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> King Ben Hadad of Syria, has sent me to you with this question,<a name="fnB325" href="2ki_note.htm#fn325"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> `Will I recover from this sickness?'" 
<bqverse 10>10  Elisha said to him, "Go and tell him, `You will surely recover,'<a name="fnB326" href="2ki_note.htm#fn326"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> but the LORD has revealed to me that he will surely die." 
<bqverse 11>11  He just stared at him until Hazael became uncomfortable.<a name="fnB327" href="2ki_note.htm#fn327"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> Then the prophet started crying. 
<bqverse 12>12  Hazael asked, "Why are you crying, my master?" He replied, "Because I know the trouble you will cause the Israelites. You will set fire to their fortresses, kill their young men with the sword, smash their children to bits, and rip open their pregnant women." 
<bqverse 13>13  Hazael said, "How could your servant, who is as insignificant as a dog, accomplish this great military victory?"<a name="fnB328" href="2ki_note.htm#fn328"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> Elisha answered, "The LORD has revealed to me that you will be the king of Syria."<a name="fnB329" href="2ki_note.htm#fn329"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  He left Elisha and went to his master.

Hazael<a name="fnB331" href="2ki_note.htm#fn331"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> replied, "He told me you would surely recover." 
<bqverse 15>15  The next day he took a piece of cloth, dipped it in water, and spread it over his face until he died. Then Hazael replaced him as king.<a name="_Toc494012019"></a></p>
<p><i>Jehoram's Reign over Judah</i>
<p>
<bqverse 16>16  In the fifth year of the reign of Israel's King Joram, son of Ahab, Jehoshaphat's son Jehoram became king over Judah.<a name="fnB332" href="2ki_note.htm#fn332"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  He was thirty-two years old when he became king and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 18>18  He followed in the footsteps of the kings of Israel, just as the Ahab's dynasty had done, for he married Ahab's daughter.<a name="fnB333" href="2ki_note.htm#fn333"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> He did evil before<a name="fnB334" href="2ki_note.htm#fn334"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD. 
<bqverse 19>19  But the LORD was unwilling to destroy Judah. He preserved Judah for the sake of<a name="fnB335" href="2ki_note.htm#fn335"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> his servant David to whom he had promised a perpetual dynasty.<a name="fnB336" href="2ki_note.htm#fn336"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 20>20  During his reign Edom freed themselves from Judah's control and set up their own king.<a name="fnB337" href="2ki_note.htm#fn337"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  Joram<a name="fnB338" href="2ki_note.htm#fn338"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> crossed over to Zair with all his chariots. The Edomites, who had surrounded him, attacked at night and defeated him and his chariot officers.<a name="fnB339" href="2ki_note.htm#fn339"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> The Israelite army retreated to their homeland.<a name="fnB340" href="2ki_note.htm#fn340"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  So Edom has remained free from Judah's control to this very day.<a name="fnB341" href="2ki_note.htm#fn341"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> At that same time Libnah also rebelled. <p>

<bqverse 23>23  The rest of the events of Joram's reign, including a record of his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah.<a name="fnB342" href="2ki_note.htm#fn342"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  Joram passed away<a name="fnB343" href="2ki_note.htm#fn343"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David. His son Ahaziah replaced him as king.<a name="_Toc494012020"></a></p>
<p><i>Ahaziah Takes the Throne of Judah</i>
<p>
<bqverse 25>25  In the twelfth year of the reign of Israel's King Joram, son of Ahab, Jehoram's son Ahaziah became king over Judah. 
<bqverse 26>26  Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. His mother was Athaliah, the granddaughter<a name="fnB344" href="2ki_note.htm#fn344"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> of King Omri of Israel. 
<bqverse 27>27  He followed in the footsteps of Ahab's dynasty and did evil before the LORD, like Ahab's dynasty, for he was related to Ahab's family.<a name="fnB345" href="2ki_note.htm#fn345"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 28>28  He joined Ahab's son Joram in a battle against King Hazael of Syria at Ramoth Gilead in which the Syrians defeated Joram. 
<bqverse 29>29  King Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he received from the Syrians<a name="fnB346" href="2ki_note.htm#fn346"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> in Ramah when he fought against King Hazael of Syria. King Ahaziah son of Jehoram of Judah went down to visit<a name="fnB347" href="2ki_note.htm#fn347"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> Joram son of Ahab in Jezreel, for he was ill.

<p><i>Jehu Becomes King</i>
<p><A NAME="9"><b>

<bqverse 2>2  When you arrive there, look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat son of Nimshi and take him aside into an inner room.<a name="fnB350" href="2ki_note.htm#fn350"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  Take the container of oil, pour it over his head, and say, `This is what the LORD says, "I have designated<a name="fnB351" href="2ki_note.htm#fn351"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> you as king over Israel."' Then leave and run away quickly."<a name="fnB352" href="2ki_note.htm#fn352"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 4>4  So the young prophet<a name="fnB353" href="2ki_note.htm#fn353"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> went to Ramoth Gilead. 
<bqverse 5>5  When he arrived, the officers of the army sitting there.<a name="fnB354" href="2ki_note.htm#fn354"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> So he said, "I have a message for you, O officer."<a name="fnB355" href="2ki_note.htm#fn355"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> Jehu asked, "For which one of us?"<a name="fnB356" href="2ki_note.htm#fn356"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> He replied, "For you, O officer." 
<bqverse 6>6  So Jehu<a name="fnB357" href="2ki_note.htm#fn357"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> got up and went inside. Then the prophet<a name="fnB358" href="2ki_note.htm#fn358"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> poured the oil on his head and said to him, "This is what the LORD God of Israel says, `I have designated you as king over the LORD's people Israel.

<bqverse 9>9  I will make Ahab's dynasty<a name="fnB363" href="2ki_note.htm#fn363"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> like those of Jeroboam son of Nebat and Baasha son of Ahijah.

<bqverse 11>11  When Jehu rejoined<a name="fnB366" href="2ki_note.htm#fn366"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> his master's servants, they<a name="fnB367" href="2ki_note.htm#fn367"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> asked him, "Is everything okay?<a name="fnB368" href="2ki_note.htm#fn368"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> Why did this madman visit you?"

<bqverse 12>12  But they said, "You're lying. Tell us what he said." So he told them what he had said.

<bqverse 13>13  Each of them quickly took off his robe and they spread them out at his feet on the steps.<a name="fnB371" href="2ki_note.htm#fn371"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> The trumpet was blown<a name="fnB372" href="2ki_note.htm#fn372"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> and they shouted, "Jehu is<a name="fnB373" href="2ki_note.htm#fn373"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> king!" 
<bqverse 14>14  Then Jehu son of Jehoshaphat son of Nimshi conspired against Joram.<a name="_Toc494012022"></a></p>
<p><i>Jehu the Assassin</i>

<bqverse 15>15  But King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he received from the Syrians<a name="fnB375" href="2ki_note.htm#fn375"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> when he fought against King Hazael of Syria.<a name="fnB376" href="2ki_note.htm#fn376"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> Jehu told his supporters,<a name="fnB377" href="2ki_note.htm#fn377"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> "If you really want me to be king,<a name="fnB378" href="2ki_note.htm#fn378"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> then don't let anyone escape from the city to go and warn Jezreel." 
<bqverse 16>16  Jehu drove his chariot<a name="fnB379" href="2ki_note.htm#fn379"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> to Jezreel, for Joram was recuperating<a name="fnB380" href="2ki_note.htm#fn380"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> there.

<bqverse 17>17  Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel and saw Jehu's troops approaching.<a name="fnB382" href="2ki_note.htm#fn382"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> He said, "I see troops."<a name="fnB383" href="2ki_note.htm#fn383"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> Jehoram ordered,<a name="fnB384" href="2ki_note.htm#fn384"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> "Send a rider out to meet them and have him ask, `Is everything okay?'"<a name="fnB385" href="2ki_note.htm#fn385"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  So the horseman<a name="fnB386" href="2ki_note.htm#fn386"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> went to meet him and said, "This is what the king says, `Is everything okay?'"<a name="fnB387" href="2ki_note.htm#fn387"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> Jehu replied, "None of your business.<a name="fnB388" href="2ki_note.htm#fn388"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> Follow me."

<bqverse 20>20  The watchman reported, "He reached them, but hasn't started back. The one who drives the lead chariot drives like Jehu son of Nimshi;<a name="fnB391" href="2ki_note.htm#fn391"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> he drives recklessly." 
<bqverse 21>21  Jehoram ordered, "Hitch up my chariot."<a name="fnB392" href="2ki_note.htm#fn392"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> When his chariot had been hitched up,<a name="fnB393" href="2ki_note.htm#fn393"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> King Jehoram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah went out in their respective chariots<a name="fnB394" href="2ki_note.htm#fn394"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> to meet Jehu.

<bqverse 22>22  When Jehoram saw Jehu, he asked, "Is everything all right, Jehu?" He replied, "How can everything be all right as long as your mother Jezebel promotes idolatry and pagan practices?"<a name="fnB396" href="2ki_note.htm#fn396"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 30>30  Jehu approached Jezreel. When Jezebel heard the news, she put on some eye liner,<a name="fnB407" href="2ki_note.htm#fn407"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> fixed up her hair, and leaned out the window. 
<bqverse 31>31  When Jehu came through the gate, she said, "Is everything okay, Zimri, murderer of his master?"<a name="fnB408" href="2ki_note.htm#fn408"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 32>32  He looked up at the window and said, "Who is on my side? Who?" Two or three<a name="fnB409" href="2ki_note.htm#fn409"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> eunuchs looked down at him. 
<bqverse 33>33  He said, "Throw her down!" So they threw her down and, when she hit the ground,<a name="fnB410" href="2ki_note.htm#fn410"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> her blood sprayed against the wall and the horses, and Jehu drove his chariot over her.<a name="fnB411" href="2ki_note.htm#fn411"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 34>34  He went inside and had a meal.<a name="fnB412" href="2ki_note.htm#fn412"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> Then he said, "Dispose of this accursed woman's corpse. Bury her, for, after all, she was a king's daughter."<a name="fnB413" href="2ki_note.htm#fn413"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 35>35  But when they went to bury her, they found nothing left but<a name="fnB414" href="2ki_note.htm#fn414"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> the skull, feet, and palms of the hands. 
<bqverse 36>36  When they went back and told him, he said, "The LORD's word through his servant, Elijah the Tishbite, has come to pass. He warned,<a name="fnB415" href="2ki_note.htm#fn415"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a> `In the plot of land at Jezreel, dogs will devour Jezebel's flesh.

<p><i>Jehu Wipes Out Ahab's Family</i>
<p><A NAME="10"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Ahab had seventy sons living in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria to the leading officials of Jezreel and to the guardians of Ahab's dynasty. This is what the letters said,<a name="fnB417" href="2ki_note.htm#fn417"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  "You have with you the sons of your master, chariots and horses, a fortified city, and weapons. So when this letter arrives,<a name="fnB418" href="2ki_note.htm#fn418"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  pick the best and most capable<a name="fnB419" href="2ki_note.htm#fn419"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> of your master's sons, place him on his father's throne, and defend<a name="fnB420" href="2ki_note.htm#fn420"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> your master's dynasty." <p>

<bqverse 4>4  They were absolutely terrified<a name="fnB421" href="2ki_note.htm#fn421"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and said, "Look, two kings could not stop him!<a name="fnB422" href="2ki_note.htm#fn422"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> How can we?"<a name="fnB423" href="2ki_note.htm#fn423"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  So the palace supervisor,<a name="fnB424" href="2ki_note.htm#fn424"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> the city commissioner,<a name="fnB425" href="2ki_note.htm#fn425"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> the leaders,<a name="fnB426" href="2ki_note.htm#fn426"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and guardians sent this message to Jehu, "We are your subjects.<a name="fnB427" href="2ki_note.htm#fn427"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> Whatever you say, we will do. We will not make anyone king. Do what you consider proper."<a name="fnB428" href="2ki_note.htm#fn428"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 6>6  He wrote them a second letter, saying, "If you are really on my side and willing to obey me,<a name="fnB429" href="2ki_note.htm#fn429"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> then take the heads of your master's sons and come to me in Jezreel at this time tomorrow."<a name="fnB430" href="2ki_note.htm#fn430"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> Now the king had seventy sons, and the prominent<a name="fnB431" href="2ki_note.htm#fn431"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> men of the city were raising them. 
<bqverse 7>7  When they received the letter, they seized the king's sons and executed all seventy of them.<a name="fnB432" href="2ki_note.htm#fn432"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> They put their heads in baskets and sent them to him in Jezreel. 
<bqverse 8>8  The messenger came and told Jehu,<a name="fnB433" href="2ki_note.htm#fn433"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> "They have brought the heads of the king's sons." Jehu<a name="fnB434" href="2ki_note.htm#fn434"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> said, "Stack them in two piles at the entrance of the gate until morning." 
<bqverse 9>9  In the morning he went out and stood there. Then he said to all the people, "You are innocent. I conspired against my master and killed him. But who struck down all of these men? 
<bqverse 10>10  Therefore take note that not one of the judgments the LORD announced against Ahab's dynasty has failed to materialize. The LORD had done what he announced through his servant Elijah."<a name="fnB435" href="2ki_note.htm#fn435"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  Then Jehu killed all who were left of Ahab's family in Jezreel, and all his nobles, close friends, and priests. He left no survivors.<p>

<bqverse 12>12  Jehu then left there and set out for Samaria.<a name="fnB436" href="2ki_note.htm#fn436"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> While he was traveling through Beth Eked of the Shepherds, 
<bqverse 13>13  Jehu ran into<a name="fnB437" href="2ki_note.htm#fn437"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> the relatives<a name="fnB438" href="2ki_note.htm#fn438"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> of King Ahaziah of Judah. He asked, "Who are you?" They replied, "We are Ahaziah's relatives. We have come down to see how<a name="fnB439" href="2ki_note.htm#fn439"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> the king's sons and the queen mother's sons are doing." 
<bqverse 14>14  He said, "Capture them alive!" So they captured them alive and then executed all forty-two of them in the cistern at Beth Eked. He left no survivors.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  When he left there, he met<a name="fnB440" href="2ki_note.htm#fn440"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> Jehonadab, son of Rekab, who had been looking for him.<a name="fnB441" href="2ki_note.htm#fn441"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> Jehu greeted him and asked,<a name="fnB442" href="2ki_note.htm#fn442"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> "Are you as committed to me as I am to you?"<a name="fnB443" href="2ki_note.htm#fn443"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> Jehonadab answered, "I am!" Jehu replied, "If so, give me your hand."<a name="fnB444" href="2ki_note.htm#fn444"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> So he offered his hand and Jehu<a name="fnB445" href="2ki_note.htm#fn445"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> pulled him up into the chariot. 
<bqverse 16>16  Jehu<a name="fnB446" href="2ki_note.htm#fn446"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> said, "Come with me and see how zealous I am for the LORD's cause."<a name="fnB447" href="2ki_note.htm#fn447"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> So he<a name="fnB448" href="2ki_note.htm#fn448"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> took him along in his chariot. 
<bqverse 17>17  He went to Samaria and exterminated all the members of Ahab's family who were still alive in Samaria,<a name="fnB449" href="2ki_note.htm#fn449"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> just as the LORD had announced to Elijah.<a name="fnB450" href="2ki_note.htm#fn450"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494012024"></a></p>
<p><i>Jehu Executes the Prophets and Priests of Baal</i>
<p>
<bqverse 18>18  Jehu assembled all the people and said to them, "Ahab worshiped<a name="fnB451" href="2ki_note.htm#fn451"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> Baal a little; Jehu will worship<a name="fnB452" href="2ki_note.htm#fn452"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> him with great devotion.<a name="fnB453" href="2ki_note.htm#fn453"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  So now, bring to me all the prophets of Baal, as well as all his servants and priests.<a name="fnB454" href="2ki_note.htm#fn454"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> None of them must be absent, for I am offering a great sacrifice to Baal. Any of them who fail to appear will lose their lives." But Jehu was tricking them<a name="fnB455" href="2ki_note.htm#fn455"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> so he could destroy the servants of Baal. 
<bqverse 20>20  Then Jehu ordered, "Make arrangements for<a name="fnB456" href="2ki_note.htm#fn456"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> a celebration for Baal." So they announced it. 
<bqverse 21>21  Jehu sent invitations throughout Israel, and all the servants of Baal came; not one was absent. They arrived at the temple of Baal and filled it up from end to end.<a name="fnB457" href="2ki_note.htm#fn457"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  Jehu ordered the one who was in charge of the wardrobe,<a name="fnB458" href="2ki_note.htm#fn458"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> "Bring out robes for all the servants of Baal." So he brought out robes for them. 
<bqverse 23>23  Then Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rekab went to the temple of Baal. Jehu<a name="fnB459" href="2ki_note.htm#fn459"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> said to the servants of Baal, "Make sure there are no servants of the LORD here with you; there must be only servants of Baal."<a name="fnB460" href="2ki_note.htm#fn460"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  They went inside to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside. He had told them, "If any of the men inside get away, you will pay with your lives."<a name="fnB461" href="2ki_note.htm#fn461"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 25>25  When he finished offering the burnt sacrifice, Jehu ordered the royal guard<a name="fnB462" href="2ki_note.htm#fn462"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> and officers, "Come in and strike them down! Don't let any escape!" So the royal guard and officers struck them down with the sword and left their bodies lying there.<a name="fnB463" href="2ki_note.htm#fn463"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> Then they entered the inner sanctuary of the temple of Baal.<a name="fnB464" href="2ki_note.htm#fn464"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  They hauled out the sacred pillar of the temple of Baal and burned it. 
<bqverse 27>27  They demolished<a name="fnB465" href="2ki_note.htm#fn465"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> the sacred pillar of Baal and<a name="fnB466" href="2ki_note.htm#fn466"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> the temple of Baal; it is used as<a name="fnB467" href="2ki_note.htm#fn467"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> a latrine<a name="fnB468" href="2ki_note.htm#fn468"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> to this very day. 
<bqverse 28>28  So Jehu eradicated Baal worship<a name="fnB469" href="2ki_note.htm#fn469"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> from Israel.<a name="_Toc494012025"></a></p>
<p><i>A Summary of Jehu's Reign </i>
<p>
<bqverse 29>29  However Jehu did not repudiate the sins which Jeroboam son of Nebat had encouraged Israel to commit; the golden calves remained in Bethel and Dan.<a name="fnB470" href="2ki_note.htm#fn470"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 30>30  The LORD said to Jehu, "You have done well. You have accomplished my will and carried out my wishes with regard to Ahab's dynasty. Therefore four generations of your descendants will rule over Israel."<a name="fnB471" href="2ki_note.htm#fn471"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 31>31  But Jehu did not carefully and wholeheartedly obey the law of the LORD God of Israel.<a name="fnB472" href="2ki_note.htm#fn472"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> He did not repudiate the sins which Jeroboam had encouraged Israel to commit.<a name="fnB473" href="2ki_note.htm#fn473"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 32>32  In those days the LORD began to reduce the size of Israel's territory.<a name="fnB474" href="2ki_note.htm#fn474"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> Hazael attacked their eastern border.<a name="fnB475" href="2ki_note.htm#fn475"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 33>33  He conquered all the land of Gilead, including the territory of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh, extending all the way from the Aroer in the Arnon Valley through Gilead to Bashan.<a name="fnB476" href="2ki_note.htm#fn476"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 34>34  The rest of the events of Jehu's reign, including all his accomplishments and successes, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.<a name="fnB477" href="2ki_note.htm#fn477"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 35>35  Jehu passed away<a name="fnB478" href="2ki_note.htm#fn478"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> and was buried in Samaria. His son Jehoahaz replaced him as king. 
<bqverse 36>36  Jehu reigned over Israel for twenty-eight years in Samaria.

<p><i>Athaliah is Eliminated</i>
<p><A NAME="11"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she was determined to destroy the entire royal line.<a name="fnB479" href="2ki_note.htm#fn479"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  So Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram and sister of Ahaziah, took Ahaziah's son Joash and sneaked him away<a name="fnB480" href="2ki_note.htm#fn480"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> from the rest of the royal descendants who were to be executed. She hid him and his nurse in the room where the bed covers were stored.<a name="fnB481" href="2ki_note.htm#fn481"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> So he was hidden from Athaliah and escaped execution.<a name="fnB482" href="2ki_note.htm#fn482"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  He hid out with his nurse in the LORD's temple<a name="fnB483" href="2ki_note.htm#fn483"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> for six years, while Athaliah was ruling over the land.<p>

<bqverse 4>4  In the seventh year Jehoiada summoned<a name="fnB484" href="2ki_note.htm#fn484"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> the officers of the units of hundreds of the Carians<a name="fnB485" href="2ki_note.htm#fn485"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> and the royal bodyguard.<a name="fnB486" href="2ki_note.htm#fn486"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> He met with them<a name="fnB487" href="2ki_note.htm#fn487"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> in the LORD's temple. He made an agreement<a name="fnB488" href="2ki_note.htm#fn488"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> with them and made them swear an oath of allegiance in the LORD's temple. Then he showed them the king's son. 
<bqverse 5>5  He ordered them, "This is what you must do. One third of the unit that is on duty during the Sabbath will guard the royal palace. 
<bqverse 6>6  Another third of you will be stationed at the Foundation<a name="fnB489" href="2ki_note.htm#fn489"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> Gate.

<bqverse 8>8  You must surround the king. Each of you must hold his weapon in his hand. Whoever approaches your ranks must be killed. You must accompany the king wherever he goes."<a name="fnB493" href="2ki_note.htm#fn493"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 9>9  The officers of the units of hundreds did just as<a name="fnB494" href="2ki_note.htm#fn494"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each of them took his men, those who were on duty during the Sabbath as well as those who were off duty on the Sabbath, and reported<a name="fnB495" href="2ki_note.htm#fn495"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> to Jehoiada the priest. 
<bqverse 10>10  The priest gave to the officers of the units of hundreds King David's spears and the shields that were kept in the LORD's temple. 
<bqverse 11>11  The royal bodyguard<a name="fnB496" href="2ki_note.htm#fn496"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> took their stations, each holding his weapon in his hand. They lined up from the south side of the temple to the north side and stood near the altar and the temple, surrounding the king.<a name="fnB497" href="2ki_note.htm#fn497"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  Jehoiada<a name="fnB498" href="2ki_note.htm#fn498"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> led out the king's son and placed on him the crown and the royal insignia.<a name="fnB499" href="2ki_note.htm#fn499"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> They proclaimed him king and poured oil on his head.<a name="fnB500" href="2ki_note.htm#fn500"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> They clapped their hands and said, "Long live the king!"<p>

<bqverse 13>13  When Athaliah heard the royal guard<a name="fnB501" href="2ki_note.htm#fn501"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> shout, she joined the crowd<a name="fnB502" href="2ki_note.htm#fn502"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> at the LORD's temple. 
<bqverse 14>14  Then she saw<a name="fnB503" href="2ki_note.htm#fn503"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> the king standing by the pillar, according to custom. The officers stood beside the king with their trumpets and all the people of the land were celebrating and blowing trumpets. Athaliah tore her clothes and yelled, "Treason, treason!"<a name="fnB504" href="2ki_note.htm#fn504"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  Jehoiada the priest ordered the officers of the units of hundreds, who were in charge of the army,<a name="fnB505" href="2ki_note.htm#fn505"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> "Bring her outside the temple to the guards.<a name="fnB506" href="2ki_note.htm#fn506"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> Put the sword to anyone who follows her."

<bqverse 16>16  They grabbed her and took her into the precincts of the royal palace through the horses' entrance.<a name="fnB508" href="2ki_note.htm#fn508"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> There she was executed.<p>

<bqchapter 12><A NAME="12"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b><i>(12.2)</i>In Jehu's seventh year Jehoash became king; he reigned for forty years in Jerusalem. His mother was Zibiah, who was from Beer Sheba. 
<bqverse 2>2  Throughout his lifetime Jehoash did what the LORD approved,<a name="fnB518" href="2ki_note.htm#fn518"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> just as<a name="fnB519" href="2ki_note.htm#fn519"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> Jehoiada the priest taught him. 
<bqverse 3>3 But the high places were not eliminated; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense on the high places.<p>

<bqverse 4>4  Jehoash said to the priests, "I place at your disposal<a name="fnB520" href="2ki_note.htm#fn520"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> all the consecrated silver that has been brought to the LORD's temple, including the silver collected from the census tax,<a name="fnB521" href="2ki_note.htm#fn521"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> the silver received from those who have made vows,<a name="fnB522" href="2ki_note.htm#fn522"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> and all the silver that people have voluntarily contributed to the LORD's temple.<a name="fnB523" href="2ki_note.htm#fn523"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 6>6  By the twenty-third year of King Jehoash's reign the priests had still not repaired the damage to the temple. 
<bqverse 7>7  So King Jehoash summoned Jehoiada the priest, as well as the other priests, and said to them, "Why have you not repaired the damage to the temple? Now, take no more silver from your treasurers unless you intend to use it to repair the damage."<a name="fnB525" href="2ki_note.htm#fn525"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  The priests agreed<a name="fnB526" href="2ki_note.htm#fn526"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> not to collect silver from the people and relieved themselves of personal responsibility for the temple repairs.<a name="fnB527" href="2ki_note.htm#fn527"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 9>9  Jehoiada the priest took a chest and drilled a hole in its lid.

The priests who guarded the entrance would put into it all the silver brought to the LORD's temple. 
<bqverse 10>10  When they saw the chest was full of silver, the royal scribe and the high priest bagged it up and counted the silver that had been brought to the LORD's temple.<a name="fnB529" href="2ki_note.htm#fn529"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  Then they would hand over<a name="fnB530" href="2ki_note.htm#fn530"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> the silver that had been weighed to the construction foremen<a name="fnB531" href="2ki_note.htm#fn531"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> assigned to the LORD's temple. They hired carpenters and builders to work on the LORD's temple, 
<bqverse 12>12  as well as masons and stone cutters. They bought wood and chiseled stone to repair the damage to the LORD's temple and also paid for all the other expenses.<a name="fnB532" href="2ki_note.htm#fn532"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  The silver brought to the LORD's temple was not used for silver bowls, trimming shears, basins, trumpets or any kind of gold or silver implements. 
<bqverse 14>14  It was handed over<a name="fnB533" href="2ki_note.htm#fn533"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> to the foremen who used it to repair the LORD's temple. 
<bqverse 15>15  They did not audit the treasurers who disbursed<a name="fnB534" href="2ki_note.htm#fn534"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> the funds to the foremen, for they were honest.<a name="fnB535" href="2ki_note.htm#fn535"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  The silver collected in conjunction with reparation offerings and sin offerings was not brought to the LORD's temple; it belonged to the priests.<p>

<bqverse 17>17  At that time King Hazael of Syria attacked<a name="fnB536" href="2ki_note.htm#fn536"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> Gath and captured it.

<bqverse 18>18  King Jehoash of Judah collected all the sacred items that his ancestors Jehoshaphat, Jehoram and Ahaziah, kings of Judah, had consecrated, as well as his own sacred items and all the gold that could be found in the treasuries of the LORD's temple and the royal palace.

<bqverse 12>12  When the king arrived back from Damascus and<a name="fnB719" href="2ki_note.htm#fn719"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> saw the altar, he approached it<a name="fnB720" href="2ki_note.htm#fn720"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> and offered a sacrifice on it.<a name="fnB721" href="2ki_note.htm#fn721"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  He offered his burnt sacrifice and his grain offering. He poured out his libation and sprinkled the blood from his peace offerings on the altar. 
<bqverse 14>14  He moved the bronze altar that stood in the LORD's presence from the front of the temple (between the altar and the LORD's temple) and put it on the north side of the new<a name="fnB722" href="2ki_note.htm#fn722"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> altar. 
<bqverse 15>15  King Ahaz ordered Uriah the priest, "On the large altar<a name="fnB723" href="2ki_note.htm#fn723"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> offer the morning burnt sacrifice, the evening grain offering, the royal burnt sacrifices and grain offering, the burnt sacrifice for all the people of Israel, their grain offering, and their libations. Sprinkle all the blood of the burnt sacrifice and other sacrifices on it. The bronze altar will be for my personal use."<a name="fnB724" href="2ki_note.htm#fn724"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  So Uriah the priest did exactly as<a name="fnB725" href="2ki_note.htm#fn725"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> King Ahaz ordered. <p>

<bqverse 17>17  King Ahaz took off the frames of the movable stands, and removed the basin from them. He took "the Sea"<a name="fnB726" href="2ki_note.htm#fn726"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> down from the bronze bulls that supported it<a name="fnB727" href="2ki_note.htm#fn727"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> and put it on the pavement. 
<bqverse 18>18  He also removed the Sabbath awning<a name="fnB728" href="2ki_note.htm#fn728"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> that had been built<a name="fnB729" href="2ki_note.htm#fn729"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> in the temple and the king's outer entranceway, on account of the king of Assyria.<a name="fnB730" href="2ki_note.htm#fn730"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 19>19  The rest of the events of Ahaz's reign, including his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah.<a name="fnB731" href="2ki_note.htm#fn731"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  Ahaz passed away<a name="fnB732" href="2ki_note.htm#fn732"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David. His son Hezekiah replaced him as king.

<p><i>Hoshea's Reign over Israel</i>
<p><A NAME="17"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> In the twelfth year of the King Ahaz's reign over Judah, Hoshea son of Elah became king over Israel. He reigned in Samaria for nine years. 
<bqverse 2>2  He did evil before<a name="fnB733" href="2ki_note.htm#fn733"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD, but not to the same degree as the Israelite kings who preceded him. 
<bqverse 3>3  King Shalmaneser of Assyria threatened<a name="fnB734" href="2ki_note.htm#fn734"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> him; Hoshea became his subject and paid him tribute. 
<bqverse 4>4  The king of Assyria discovered that Hoshea was planning a revolt.<a name="fnB735" href="2ki_note.htm#fn735"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> Hoshea had sent messengers to King So<a name="fnB736" href="2ki_note.htm#fn736"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> of Egypt and had not sent his annual tribute to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria arrested him and imprisoned him.<a name="fnB737" href="2ki_note.htm#fn737"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  The king of Assyria marched through<a name="fnB738" href="2ki_note.htm#fn738"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> the whole land. He attacked Samaria and besieged it for three years. 
<bqverse 6>6  In the ninth year of Hoshea's reign, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported the people of Israel<a name="fnB739" href="2ki_note.htm#fn739"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> to Assyria. He settled them in Halah, along the Habor (the river of Gozan), and in the cities of the Medes.<a name="_Toc494012041"></a></p>
<p><i>A Summary of Israel's Sinful History</i>
<p>
<bqverse 7>7  This happened because the Israelites sinned against the LORD their God, who brought them up from the land of Egypt and freed them from the power of<a name="fnB740" href="2ki_note.htm#fn740"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> Pharaoh king of Egypt. They worshiped<a name="fnB741" href="2ki_note.htm#fn741"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> other gods; 
<bqverse 8>8  they observed the practices<a name="fnB742" href="2ki_note.htm#fn742"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> of the nations whom the LORD had driven out from before Israel, and followed the example of the kings of Israel.<a name="fnB743" href="2ki_note.htm#fn743"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  The Israelites said things about the LORD their God that were not right.<a name="fnB744" href="2ki_note.htm#fn744"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> They built high places in all their cities, from the watchtower to the fortress.<a name="fnB745" href="2ki_note.htm#fn745"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  They set up sacred pillars and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree. 
<bqverse 11>11  They burned incense on all the high places just like the nations whom the LORD had driven away from before them. Their evil practices made the LORD angry.<a name="fnB746" href="2ki_note.htm#fn746"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  They worshiped<a name="fnB747" href="2ki_note.htm#fn747"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> the disgusting idols<a name="fnB748" href="2ki_note.htm#fn748"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> in blatant disregard of the LORD's command.<a name="fnB749" href="2ki_note.htm#fn749"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 13>13  The LORD solemnly warned Israel and Judah through all his prophets and all the seers, "Turn back from your evil ways; obey my commandments and rules that are recorded in the law. I ordered your ancestors to keep this law and sent my servants the prophets to remind you of its demands."<a name="fnB750" href="2ki_note.htm#fn750"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  But they did not pay attention and were as stubborn as their ancestors,<a name="fnB751" href="2ki_note.htm#fn751"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> who had not trusted the LORD their God. 
<bqverse 15>15  They rejected his rules, the covenant he had made with their ancestors, and the laws he had commanded them to obey.<a name="fnB752" href="2ki_note.htm#fn752"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> They paid allegiance to<a name="fnB753" href="2ki_note.htm#fn753"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> worthless idols, and so became worthless to me.<a name="fnB754" href="2ki_note.htm#fn754"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> They copied the practices of the surrounding nations in blatant disregard of the LORD's command.<a name="fnB755" href="2ki_note.htm#fn755"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  They abandoned all the commandments of the LORD their God; they made two metal calves and an Asherah pole, bowed down to all the stars in the sky,<a name="fnB756" href="2ki_note.htm#fn756"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> and worshiped<a name="fnB757" href="2ki_note.htm#fn757"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> Baal. 
<bqverse 17>17  They passed their sons and daughters through the fire,<a name="fnB758" href="2ki_note.htm#fn758"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> and practiced divination and omen reading. They committed themselves to doing evil before the LORD and made him angry.<a name="fnB759" href="2ki_note.htm#fn759"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 18>18  So the LORD was furious<a name="fnB760" href="2ki_note.htm#fn760"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> with Israel and rejected them;<a name="fnB761" href="2ki_note.htm#fn761"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> only the tribe of Judah was left. 
<bqverse 19>19  Judah also failed to keep the commandments of the LORD their God; they followed Israel's example.<a name="fnB762" href="2ki_note.htm#fn762"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  So the LORD rejected all of Israel's descendants; he humiliated<a name="fnB763" href="2ki_note.htm#fn763"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> them and handed them over to robbers, until he got rid of them.<a name="fnB764" href="2ki_note.htm#fn764"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  He tore Israel away from David's dynasty, and Jeroboam son of Nebat became their king.<a name="fnB765" href="2ki_note.htm#fn765"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> Jeroboam drove Israel away<a name="fnB766" href="2ki_note.htm#fn766"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> from the LORD and encouraged them to commit a serious sin.<a name="fnB767" href="2ki_note.htm#fn767"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  The Israelites followed in the sinful ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat and did not repudiate<a name="fnB768" href="2ki_note.htm#fn768"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> them. 
<bqverse 23>23  Finally<a name="fnB769" href="2ki_note.htm#fn769"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD rejected Israel<a name="fnB770" href="2ki_note.htm#fn770"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> just as he had warned he would do<a name="fnB771" href="2ki_note.htm#fn771"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> through all his servants the prophets. Israel was deported from its land to Assyria and remains there to this very day.<a name="_Toc494012042"></a></p>
<p><i>The King of Assyria Populates Israel with Foreigners</i>
<p>
<bqverse 24>24  The king of Assyria brought foreigners<a name="fnB772" href="2ki_note.htm#fn772"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim and settled them in the cities of Samaria<a name="fnB773" href="2ki_note.htm#fn773"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> in place of the Israelites. They took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities. 
<bqverse 25>25  When they first moved in,<a name="fnB774" href="2ki_note.htm#fn774"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> they did not worship<a name="fnB775" href="2ki_note.htm#fn775"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD. So the LORD sent lions among them and the lions were killing them. 
<bqverse 26>26  The king of Assyria was told,<a name="fnB776" href="2ki_note.htm#fn776"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> "The nations whom you deported and settled in the cities of Samaria do not know the requirements of the God of the land, so he has sent lions among them. They are killing the people<a name="fnB777" href="2ki_note.htm#fn777"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> because they do not know the requirements of the God of the land." 
<bqverse 27>27  So the king of Assyria ordered, "Take back one of the priests whom you<a name="fnB778" href="2ki_note.htm#fn778"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> deported from there. He must settle there and teach them the requirements of the God of the land."<a name="fnB779" href="2ki_note.htm#fn779"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  So one of the priests whom they had deported from Samaria went back and settled in Bethel. He taught them how to worship<a name="fnB780" href="2ki_note.htm#fn780"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD.<p>

<bqverse 29>29  But each of these nations made<a name="fnB781" href="2ki_note.htm#fn781"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> its own gods and put them in the shrines on the high places that the people of Samaria<a name="fnB782" href="2ki_note.htm#fn782"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> had made. Each nation did this in the cities where they lived. 
<bqverse 30>30  The people from Babylon made Succoth Benoth,<a name="fnB783" href="2ki_note.htm#fn783"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> the people from Cuth made Nergal,<a name="fnB784" href="2ki_note.htm#fn784"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> the people from Hamath made Ashima,<a name="fnB785" href="2ki_note.htm#fn785"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 31>31  the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak,<a name="fnB786" href="2ki_note.htm#fn786"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> and the Sepharvites burned their sons in the fire as an offering to Adrammelech and Anammelech,<a name="fnB787" href="2ki_note.htm#fn787"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> the gods of Sepharvaim. 
<bqverse 32>32  At the same time they worshiped<a name="fnB788" href="2ki_note.htm#fn788"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD. They appointed some of their own people to serve as priests in the shrines on the high places.<a name="fnB789" href="2ki_note.htm#fn789"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 33>33  They were worshiping<a name="fnB790" href="2ki_note.htm#fn790"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD and at the same time serving their own gods in accordance with the practices of the nations from where they had been deported. <p>

<bqverse 34>34  To this very day they observe their earlier practices. They do not worship<a name="fnB791" href="2ki_note.htm#fn791"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD; they do not obey the rules, regulations, law, and commandments that the LORD gave<a name="fnB792" href="2ki_note.htm#fn792"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> the descendants of Jacob, whom he renamed Israel. 
<bqverse 35>35  The LORD made an agreement<a name="fnB793" href="2ki_note.htm#fn793"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> with them<a name="fnB794" href="2ki_note.htm#fn794"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> and instructed them, "You must not worship other gods. Do not bow down to them, serve them, or offer sacrifices to them. 
<bqverse 36>36  Instead you must worship the LORD, who brought you up from the land of Egypt by his great power and military ability;<a name="fnB795" href="2ki_note.htm#fn795"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> bow down to him and offer sacrifices to him. 
<bqverse 37>37  You must carefully obey at all times the rules, regulations, law and commandments he wrote down for you. You must not worship other gods. 
<bqverse 38>38  You must never forget the agreement I made with you, and you must not worship other gods. 
<bqverse 39>39  Instead you must worship the LORD your God; then he will rescue you from the power of all your enemies." 
<bqverse 40>40  But they<a name="fnB796" href="2ki_note.htm#fn796"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> do not pay attention; instead they observe their earlier practices. 
<bqverse 41>41 These nations are worshiping the LORD and at the same time serving their idols; their sons and grandsons do just as their fathers have done, to this very day.

<p><i>Hezekiah Becomes King of Judah</i>
<p><A NAME="18"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> In the third year of the reign of Israel's King Hoshea son of Elah, Ahaz's son Hezekiah became king over Judah. 
<bqverse 2>2  He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother<a name="fnB797" href="2ki_note.htm#fn797"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> was Abi,<a name="fnB798" href="2ki_note.htm#fn798"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> the daughter of Zechariah.

<bqverse 4>4  He eliminated the high places, smashed the sacred pillars to bits, and cut down the Asherah pole. He also demolished the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for up to that time<a name="fnB800" href="2ki_note.htm#fn800"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> the Israelites had been offering incense to it; it was called Nehushtan.<a name="fnB801" href="2ki_note.htm#fn801"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 17>17  The king of Assyria sent his general, the chief eunuch, and the chief adviser<a name="fnB819" href="2ki_note.htm#fn819"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> from Lachish to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem, along with a large army. They went up and arrived at Jerusalem. They went<a name="fnB820" href="2ki_note.htm#fn820"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> and stood at the conduit of the upper pool which is located on the road to the field where they wash and dry cloth.<a name="fnB821" href="2ki_note.htm#fn821"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  They summoned the king, so Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace supervisor, accompanied by Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph, the secretary, went out to meet them. <p>

<bqverse 19>19  The chief adviser said to them, "Tell Hezekiah: `This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: "What is your source of confidence?<a name="fnB822" href="2ki_note.htm#fn822"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  Your claim to have a strategy and military strength is just empty talk.<a name="fnB823" href="2ki_note.htm#fn823"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> In whom are you trusting that you would dare to rebel against me? 
<bqverse 21>21  Now look, you must be trusting in Egypt, that splintered reed staff. If a man leans for support on it, it punctures his hand and wounds him. That is what Pharaoh king of Egypt does to all who trust in him. 
<bqverse 22>22  Perhaps you will tell me, `We are trusting in the LORD our God.' But Hezekiah is the one who eliminated his high places and altars and then told the people of Judah and Jerusalem, `You must worship at this altar in Jerusalem.' 
<bqverse 23>23  Now make a deal<a name="fnB824" href="2ki_note.htm#fn824"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, provided you can find enough riders for them. 
<bqverse 24>24  Certainly you will not refuse one of my master's minor officials and trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen.<a name="fnB825" href="2ki_note.htm#fn825"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  Furthermore it was by the command of the LORD that I marched up against this place to destroy it. The LORD told me, `March<a name="fnB826" href="2ki_note.htm#fn826"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> up against this land and destroy it.'"'"<a name="fnB827" href="2ki_note.htm#fn827"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 26>26  Eliakim son of Hilkiah, Shebna, and Joah said to the chief adviser, "Speak to your servants in Aramaic,<a name="fnB828" href="2ki_note.htm#fn828"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> for we understand it. Don't speak with us in the Judahite dialect<a name="fnB829" href="2ki_note.htm#fn829"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> in the hearing of the people who are on the wall." 
<bqverse 27>27  But the chief adviser said to them, "My master did not send me to speak these words only to your master and to you.<a name="fnB830" href="2ki_note.htm#fn830"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> His message is also for the men who sit on the wall, for they will eat their own excrement and drink their own urine along with you."<a name="fnB831" href="2ki_note.htm#fn831"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 28>28  The chief adviser then stood there and called out loudly in the Judahite dialect,<a name="fnB832" href="2ki_note.htm#fn832"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> "Listen to the message of the great king, the king of Assyria. 
<bqverse 29>29  This is what the king says: `Don't let Hezekiah mislead you, for he is not able to rescue you from my hand.<a name="fnB833" href="2ki_note.htm#fn833"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 30>30  Don't let Hezekiah talk you into trusting in the LORD, when he says, "The LORD will certainly rescue us; this city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria." 
<bqverse 31>31  Don't listen to Hezekiah!' For this is what the king of Assyria says, `Send me a token of your submission and surrender to me.<a name="fnB834" href="2ki_note.htm#fn834"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> Then each of you may eat from his own vine and fig tree and drink water from his own cistern, 
<bqverse 32>32  until I come and take you to a land just like your own--a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey. Then you will live and not die. Don't listen to Hezekiah, for he is misleading you when he says, "The LORD will rescue us." 
<bqverse 33>33  Has any of the gods of the nations actually rescued his land from the power of the king of Assyria?<a name="fnB835" href="2ki_note.htm#fn835"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 35>35  Who among all the gods of the lands have rescued their lands from my power? So how can the LORD rescue Jerusalem from my power?'"<a name="fnB838" href="2ki_note.htm#fn838"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 36>36  The people were silent and did not respond, for the king had ordered, "Don't respond to him."<p>

<bqverse 37>37  Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace supervisor, accompanied by Shebna the scribe and Joah son of Asaph, the secretary, went to Hezekiah with their clothes torn<a name="fnB839" href="2ki_note.htm#fn839"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> and reported to him what the chief adviser had said. 
<bqchapter 19><A NAME="19"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and went to the LORD's temple. 
<bqverse 2>2  He sent Eliakim the palace supervisor, Shebna the scribe, and the leading priests,<a name="fnB840" href="2ki_note.htm#fn840"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> clothed in sackcloth, with this message to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz:

<bqverse 4>4  Perhaps the LORD your God will hear all these things the chief adviser has spoken on behalf of his master, the king of Assyria, who sent him to taunt the living God.<a name="fnB845" href="2ki_note.htm#fn845"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> When the LORD your God hears, perhaps he will punish him for the things he has said.<a name="fnB846" href="2ki_note.htm#fn846"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> So pray for this remnant that remains.'"<a name="fnB847" href="2ki_note.htm#fn847"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 5>5  When King Hezekiah's servants came to Isaiah, 
<bqverse 6>6  Isaiah said to them, "Tell your master this: `This is what the LORD says: "Don't be afraid because of the things you have heard--these insults the king of Assyria's servants have hurled against me.<a name="fnB848" href="2ki_note.htm#fn848"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 8>8  When the chief adviser heard the king of Assyria had departed from Lachish, he left and went to Libnah, where the king was campaigning.<a name="fnB852" href="2ki_note.htm#fn852"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  The king<a name="fnB853" href="2ki_note.htm#fn853"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> heard that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia was marching out to fight him.<a name="fnB854" href="2ki_note.htm#fn854"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> He again sent messengers to Hezekiah, ordering them:

<bqverse 11>11  Certainly you have heard how the kings of Assyria have annihilated all lands.<a name="fnB856" href="2ki_note.htm#fn856"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> Do you really think you will be rescued?<a name="fnB857" href="2ki_note.htm#fn857"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 14>14  Hezekiah took the letter<a name="fnB860" href="2ki_note.htm#fn860"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> from the messengers and read it.<a name="fnB861" href="2ki_note.htm#fn861"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> Then Hezekiah went up to the LORD's temple and spread it out before the LORD. 
<bqverse 15>15  Hezekiah prayed before the LORD: "LORD God of Israel, who is enthroned on the cherubs!<a name="fnB862" href="2ki_note.htm#fn862"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> You alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth.

<bqverse 17>17  It is true, LORD, that the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands.

<bqverse 19>19  Now, O LORD our God, rescue us from his power, so all the kingdoms of the earth might know that you, LORD, are the only God."<p>

<bqverse 20>20  Isaiah son of Amoz sent this message to Hezekiah: "This is what the LORD God of Israel says: `I have heard your prayer concerning King Sennacherib of Assyria.<a name="fnB867" href="2ki_note.htm#fn867"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a>

<br>
<bqverse 31>31  For a remnant will leave Jerusalem; <br>

The intense devotion of the sovereign LORD<a name="fnB896" href="2ki_note.htm#fn896"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> to his people<a name="fnB897" href="2ki_note.htm#fn897"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> will accomplish this.<br>

<bqverse 32>32  So this is what the LORD says about the king of Assyria: <br>
"He will not enter this city,<br>
nor will he shoot an arrow here.<a name="fnB898" href="2ki_note.htm#fn898"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a><br>
He will not attack it with his shielded warriors,<a name="fnB899" href="2ki_note.htm#fn899"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a><br>
nor will he build siege works against it.<br>

<bqverse 33>33  He will go back the way he came,<br>
he will not enter this city," says the LORD.</ul><p>
<bqverse 34>34  I will shield this city and rescue it for the sake of my reputation and because of my promise to David my servant.'"<a name="fnB900" href="2ki_note.htm#fn900"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 35>35  That very night the LORD's messenger went out and killed one hundred eighty-five thousand men in the Assyrian camp.

<bqverse 36>36  So King Sennacherib of Assyria broke camp and went on his way. He went home and stayed in Nineveh.<a name="fnB903" href="2ki_note.htm#fn903"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 37>37  One day,<a name="fnB904" href="2ki_note.htm#fn904"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a> as he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch,<a name="fnB905" href="2ki_note.htm#fn905"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> his sons<a name="fnB906" href="2ki_note.htm#fn906"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a> Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword.<a name="fnB907" href="2ki_note.htm#fn907"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>69</SUP></FONT></a> They ran away to the land of Ararat; his son Esarhaddon replaced him as king.

<p><i>Manasseh's Reign over Judah</i>
<p><A NAME="21"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned for fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother<a name="fnB936" href="2ki_note.htm#fn936"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> was Hephzibah. 
<bqverse 2>2  He did evil before<a name="fnB937" href="2ki_note.htm#fn937"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD and committed the same horrible sins practiced by the nations<a name="fnB938" href="2ki_note.htm#fn938"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> whom the LORD drove out from before the Israelites. 
<bqverse 3>3  He rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed; he set up altars for Baal and made an Asherah pole just like King Ahab of Israel had done. He bowed down to all the stars in the sky<a name="fnB939" href="2ki_note.htm#fn939"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> and worshiped<a name="fnB940" href="2ki_note.htm#fn940"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> them. 
<bqverse 4>4  He built altars in the LORD's temple, about which the LORD had said, "Jerusalem will be my home."<a name="fnB941" href="2ki_note.htm#fn941"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  In the two courtyards of the LORD's temple he built altars for all the stars in the sky. 
<bqverse 6>6  He passed his son<a name="fnB942" href="2ki_note.htm#fn942"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> through the fire<a name="fnB943" href="2ki_note.htm#fn943"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> and practiced divination and omen reading. He set up a pit to conjure up underworld spirits, and appointed magicians to supervise it.<a name="fnB944" href="2ki_note.htm#fn944"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> He did a great amount of evil before the LORD and angered him.<a name="fnB945" href="2ki_note.htm#fn945"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  He put an idol of Asherah he had made in the temple, about which the LORD had said to David and to his son Solomon, "This temple in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will be my permanent home.<a name="fnB946" href="2ki_note.htm#fn946"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  I will not make Israel again leave the land I gave to their ancestors,<a name="fnB947" href="2ki_note.htm#fn947"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> provided that they carefully obey all I commanded them, the whole law my servant Moses ordered them to obey." 
<bqverse 9>9  But they did not obey<a name="fnB948" href="2ki_note.htm#fn948"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> and Manasseh misled them so that they sinned more than the nations whom the LORD had destroyed from before the Israelites.<p>

<bqverse 10>10  So the LORD announced through<a name="fnB949" href="2ki_note.htm#fn949"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> his servants the prophets: 
<bqverse 11>11  "King Manasseh of Judah has committed horrible sins.<a name="fnB950" href="2ki_note.htm#fn950"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> He has sinned more than the Amorites before him and has encouraged Judah to sin by worshiping his disgusting idols.<a name="fnB951" href="2ki_note.htm#fn951"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  So this is what the LORD God of Israel says, `I am about to bring disaster on Jerusalem and Judah. The news will reverberate in the ears of those who hear about it.<a name="fnB952" href="2ki_note.htm#fn952"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  I will destroy Jerusalem the same way I did Samaria and the dynasty of Ahab.<a name="fnB953" href="2ki_note.htm#fn953"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> I will wipe Jerusalem clean, just as one wipes a plate on both sides.<a name="fnB954" href="2ki_note.htm#fn954"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  I will abandon this last remaining tribe among my people<a name="fnB955" href="2ki_note.htm#fn955"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> and hand them over to their enemies; they will be plundered and robbed by all their enemies,<a name="fnB956" href="2ki_note.htm#fn956"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 16>16  Furthermore Manasseh killed so many innocent people, he stained Jerusalem with their blood from end to end,<a name="fnB958" href="2ki_note.htm#fn958"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> in addition to encouraging Judah to sin by doing evil before the LORD.<a name="fnB959" href="2ki_note.htm#fn959"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 17>17  The rest of the events of Manasseh's reign and all his accomplishments, as well as the sinful acts he committed, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah.<a name="fnB960" href="2ki_note.htm#fn960"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Amon's Reign over Judah</i>

<bqverse 23>23  Amon's servants conspired against him and killed the king in his palace.

<p><i>Josiah Repents</i>
<p><A NAME="22"><b>

<bqverse 2>2  He did what the LORD approved<a name="fnB972" href="2ki_note.htm#fn972"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> and followed in his ancestor David's footsteps;<a name="fnB973" href="2ki_note.htm#fn973"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> he did not deviate to the right or the left.<p>

<bqverse 3>3  In the eighteenth year of King Josiah's reign, the king sent the scribe Shaphan son of Azaliah, son of Meshullam, to the LORD's temple with these orders:<a name="fnB974" href="2ki_note.htm#fn974"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  "Go up to Hilkiah the high priest and have him melt down<a name="fnB975" href="2ki_note.htm#fn975"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> the silver that has been brought by the people to the LORD's temple and has been collected by the guards at the door. 
<bqverse 5>5  Have them hand it over to the construction foremen<a name="fnB976" href="2ki_note.htm#fn976"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> assigned to the LORD's temple.

<bqverse 8>8  Hilkiah the high priest informed Shaphan the scribe, "I found the law scroll in the LORD's temple." Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphan and he read it. 
<bqverse 9>9  Shaphan the scribe went to the king and reported,<a name="fnB980" href="2ki_note.htm#fn980"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> "Your servants melted down the silver in the temple<a name="fnB981" href="2ki_note.htm#fn981"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> and handed it over to the construction foremen assigned to the LORD's temple." 
<bqverse 10>10  Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a scroll." Shaphan read it out loud before the king. 
<bqverse 11>11  When the king heard the words of the law scroll, he tore his clothes. 
<bqverse 12>12  The king ordered Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Acbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, 
<bqverse 13>13  "Go, seek an oracle from<a name="fnB982" href="2ki_note.htm#fn982"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD for me and the people--for all Judah.

<bqverse 14>14  So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Acbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shullam son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, the supervisor of the wardrobe.<a name="fnB986" href="2ki_note.htm#fn986"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> (She lived in Jerusalem in the Mishneh<a name="fnB987" href="2ki_note.htm#fn987"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> district.)

<bqverse 8>8  He brought all the priests from the cities of Judah and ruined<a name="fnB1016" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1016"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> the high places where the priests had offered sacrifices, from Geba to Beersheba.<a name="fnB1017" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1017"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> He tore down the high place of the goat idols<a name="fnB1018" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1018"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> situated at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the city official, on the left side of the city gate. 
<bqverse 9>9  (Now the priests of the high places did not go up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat unleavened cakes among their fellow priests.)<a name="fnB1019" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1019"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  The king<a name="fnB1020" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1020"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> ruined Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom so that no one could pass his son or his daughter through the fire to Molech.<a name="fnB1021" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1021"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  He removed from the entrance to the LORD's temple the statues of horses<a name="fnB1022" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1022"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> that the kings of Judah had placed there in honor of the sun god. (They were kept near the room of Nathan Melech the eunuch, which was situated among the courtyards.)<a name="fnB1023" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1023"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> He burned up the chariots devoted to the sun god.<a name="fnB1024" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1024"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  The king tore down the altars the kings of Judah had set up on the roof of Ahaz's upper room, as well as the altars Manasseh had set up in the two courtyards of the LORD's temple. He crushed them up<a name="fnB1025" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1025"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> and threw the dust in the Kidron Valley. 
<bqverse 13>13  The king ruined the high places east of Jerusalem, south of the Mount of Destruction,<a name="fnB1026" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1026"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> that King Solomon of Israel had built for the detestable Sidonian goddess Astarte, the detestable Moabite god Chemosh, and the horrible Ammonite god Milcom. 
<bqverse 14>14  He smashed the sacred pillars to bits, cut down the Asherah pole, and filled those shrines<a name="fnB1027" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1027"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> with human bones. <p>

<bqverse 15>15  He also tore down the altar in Bethel at the high place made by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who encouraged Israel to sin.<a name="fnB1028" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1028"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> He burned all the combustible items at that high place and crushed them to dust; including the Asherah pole.<a name="fnB1029" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1029"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  When Josiah turned around, he saw the tombs there on the hill. So he ordered the bones from the tombs to be brought;<a name="fnB1030" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1030"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> he burned them on the altar and defiled it. This fulfilled the LORD's announcement made by the prophet while Jeroboam stood by the altar during a festival. The king turned and saw the grave of the prophet who had foretold this.<a name="fnB1031" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1031"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  He asked, "What is this grave marker I see?" The men from the city replied, "It's the grave of the prophet<a name="fnB1032" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1032"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> who came from Judah and foretold these very things you have done to the altar of Bethel." 
<bqverse 18>18  The king<a name="fnB1033" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1033"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> said, "Leave it alone. No one must touch his bones." So they left his bones undisturbed, as well as the bones of the Israelite prophet buried beside him.<a name="fnB1034" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1034"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 19>19  Josiah also removed all the shrines on the high places in the cities of Samaria. The kings of Israel had made them and angered the LORD.<a name="fnB1035" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1035"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> He did to them what he had done to the high place in Bethel.<a name="fnB1036" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1036"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  He sacrificed all the priests of the high places on the altars located there, and burned human bones on them. Then he returned to Jerusalem.<p>

<bqverse 21>21  The king ordered all the people, "Observe the Passover of the LORD your God, as prescribed in this scroll of the covenant." 
<bqverse 22>22  He issued this edict because<a name="fnB1037" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1037"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> a Passover like this had not been observed since the days of the judges; it was neglected for the entire period of the kings of Israel and Judah.<a name="fnB1038" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1038"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23  But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah's reign, such a Passover of the LORD was observed in Jerusalem.<p>

<bqverse 24>24  Josiah also got rid of<a name="fnB1039" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1039"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> the pits used to conjure up spirits,<a name="fnB1040" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1040"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> the magicians, personal idols, disgusting images,<a name="fnB1041" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1041"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> and all the detestable idols that had appeared in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem. In this way he carried out the terms of the law<a name="fnB1042" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1042"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> recorded on the scroll that Hilkiah the priest discovered in the LORD's temple. 
<bqverse 25>25  No king before or after repented before the LORD as he did, with his whole heart, soul, and being in accordance with the whole law of Moses.<a name="fnB1043" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1043"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 26>26  Yet the LORD's great anger against Judah did not subside; he was still infuriated by all the things Manasseh had done.<a name="fnB1044" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1044"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  The LORD announced, "I will also spurn Judah,<a name="fnB1045" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1045"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> just as I spurned Israel. I will reject this city that I chose--both Jerusalem and the temple, about which I said, "I will live there."<a name="fnB1046" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1046"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 28>28  The rest of the events of Josiah's reign and all his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah.<a name="fnB1047" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1047"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 29>29  During Josiah's reign Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt marched toward<a name="fnB1048" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1048"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> the Euphrates River to help the king of Assyria. King Josiah marched out to fight him, but Necho<a name="fnB1049" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1049"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> killed him in Megiddo when he saw him. 
<bqverse 30>30  His servants transported his dead body<a name="fnB1050" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1050"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> from Megiddo in a chariot and brought it to Jerusalem, where they buried him in his tomb. The people of the land took Josiah's son Jehoahaz, poured oil on his head,<a name="fnB1051" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1051"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> and made him king in his father's place. <a name="_Toc494012051"></a></p>
<p><i>Jehoahaz's Reign over Judah</i>
<p>
<bqverse 31>31  Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother<a name="fnB1052" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1052"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah, from Libnah. 
<bqverse 32>32  He did evil before<a name="fnB1053" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1053"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD as his ancestors had done.<a name="fnB1054" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1054"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 33>33  Pharaoh Necho imprisoned him in Riblah in the land of Hamath and prevented him from ruling in Jerusalem.<a name="fnB1055" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1055"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> He imposed on the land a special tax<a name="fnB1056" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1056"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> of one hundred units<a name="fnB1057" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1057"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> of silver and a unit of gold. 
<bqverse 34>34  Pharaoh Necho made Josiah's son Eliakim king in Josiah's place, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. He took Jehoahaz to Egypt, where he died.<a name="fnB1058" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1058"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 35>35  Jehoiakim paid Pharaoh the required amount of silver and gold, but to meet Pharaoh's demands Jehoiakim had to tax the land. He collected an assessed amount from each man among the people of the land in order to pay Pharaoh Necho.<a name="fnB1059" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1059"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> <a name="_Toc494012052"></a></p>
<p><i>Jehoiakim's Reign over Judah</i>
<p>
<bqverse 36>36  Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah, from Rumah. 
<bqverse 37>37  He did evil before the LORD as his ancestors had done. <p>

<bqverse 13>13  He took from there all the riches in the treasuries of the LORD's temple and of the royal palace. He removed all the gold items which King Solomon of Israel had made for the LORD's temple, just as the LORD had warned. 
<bqverse 14>14  He deported all the residents of Jerusalem, including all the officials and all the soldiers (ten thousand people in all). This included all the craftsmen and those who worked with metal. No one was left except for the poorest among the people of the land. 
<bqverse 15>15  He deported Jehoiachin from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with the king's mother and wives, his eunuchs, and the high ranking officials of the land.<a name="fnB1073" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1073"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 19>19  From the city he took a eunuch who was in charge of the soldiers, five<a name="fnB1107" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> of the king's advisers<a name="fnB1108" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1108"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> who were discovered in the city, an official army secretary who drafted citizens<a name="fnB1109" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1109"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> for military service, and sixty citizens from the people of the land who were discovered in the city. 
<bqverse 20>20  Nebuzaradan, captain of the royal guard, took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
<bqverse 21>21  The king of Babylon ordered them to be executed<a name="fnB1110" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> at Riblah in the territory<a name="fnB1111" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> of Hamath. So Judah was deported from its land. <a name="_Toc494012056"></a></p>
<p><i>Gedaliah Appointed Governor</i>
<p>
<bqverse 22>22  Now King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, as governor over the people whom he allowed to remain in the land of Judah.<a name="fnB1112" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1112"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 23>23  All of the officers of the Judahite army<a name="fnB1113" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1113"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> and their troops heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah to govern. So they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. The officers who came were Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah son of the Maachathite. 
<bqverse 24>24  Gedaliah took an oath so as to give them and their troops some assurance of safety.<a name="fnB1114" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1114"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> He said, "You don't need to be afraid to submit to the Babylonian officials. Settle down in the land and submit to the king of Babylon. Then things will go well for you." 
<bqverse 25>25  But in the seventh month<a name="fnB1115" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1115"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> Ishmael son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, who was a member of the royal family,<a name="fnB1116" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1116"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> came with ten of his men and murdered Gedaliah,<a name="fnB1117" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1117"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> and the Judeans and Babylonians who were with him at Mizpah. 
<bqverse 26>26  Then all the people, from the youngest to the oldest, as well as the army officers, left for<a name="fnB1118" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1118"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> Egypt, because they were afraid of what the Babylonians might do.<a name="_Toc494012057"></a></p>
<p><i>Jehoiachin in Babylon</i>
<p>
<bqverse 27>27  In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah, on the twenty-seventh<a name="fnB1119" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1119"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> day of the twelfth month,<a name="fnB1120" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1120"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> King Evil-Merodach of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, pardoned<a name="fnB1121" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1121"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> King Jehoiachin of Judah and released him<a name="fnB1122" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1122"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> from prison. 
<bqverse 28>28  He spoke kindly to him and gave him a more prestigious position than<a name="fnB1123" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1123"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> the other kings who were with him in Babylon. 
<bqverse 29>29  Jehoiachin<a name="fnB1124" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1124"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> took off his prison clothes and ate daily in the king's presence for the rest of his life. 
<bqverse 30>30  He was given daily provisions by the king for the rest of his life until the day he died.<a name="fnB1125" href="2ki_note.htm#fn1125"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a></p>
