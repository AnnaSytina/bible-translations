 <b>tn</b> (1:1)  The phrase "This is what we proclaim to you" is not in the Greek text, but has been supplied to clarify the English. The main verb which governs all of these relative clauses is <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajpaggevllomen</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">apangellomen</FONT>) in v. 3. This is important for the proper understanding of the relative clauses in v. 1, because the main verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajpaggevllomen</FONT> in v. 3 makes it clear that all of the relative clauses in vv. 1 and 3 are the <i>objects</i> of the author's proclamation to the readers rather than the <i>subjects</i>. To indicate this the phrase "This is what we proclaim to you" has been supplied at the beginning of v. 1.<br>

 <a name="fn3" href="1jo.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  In the Greek text the prologue to 1 John (vv. 1-4) make up a single sentence. This is awkward in Greek, and a literal translation produces almost impossible English. For this reason the present translation places a period at the end of v. 2 and another at the end of v. 3. The material in parentheses in v. 1 begins the first of <i>three</i> parenthetical interruptions in the grammatical sequence of the prologue (the second is the entirety of v. 2 and the third is the latter part of v. 3). This is because of the awkwardness of connecting the prepositional phrase with what precedes, an awkwardness not immediately obvious in most English translations: "what we beheld and our hands handled concerning the word of life..." As J. Bonsirven (<i>&Eacute;p&icirc;tres de Saint Jean </i>[CNT], 67) noted, while one may <i>hear</i> about the word of life, it is more difficult to <i>see</i> about the word of life, and impossible to <i>feel</i> with one's hands about the word of life. Rather than being the <i>object</i> of any of the verbs in v. 1, the prepositional phrase at the end of v. 1 ("concerning the word of life...") is more likely a parenthetical clarification intended to specify the <i>subject</i> of the eyewitness testimony which the verbs in v. 1 describe. A parallel for such parenthetical explanation may be found in John 1:12 (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">toi'" pisteuvousin eij" toV o[noma aujtou'</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">toi" pisteuousin ei" to onoma autou</FONT>).<br>

Although the majority of Byzantine minuscules are split between the two readings, the Textus Receptus reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uJmw'n</FONT>. It is possible that <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uJmw'n</FONT> represents a scribal assimilation to John 16:24. As far as the immediate context is concerned, either reading could possibly be original, since the recipients have already been mentioned in 1:2 (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uJmi'n</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jumin</FONT>) and 1:3 (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uJmi'n</FONT>), while it might seem more natural for the author to be concerned about the fulfillment of his own joy than his readers' (cf. 2 John 4, 12; 3 John 3).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (1:4)  <i>This is what we proclaim to you...so that our joy may be complete. </i>The prologue to 1 John (1:1-4) has many similarities to the prologue to the Gospel of John (1:1-18). Like the prologue to the Fourth Gospel, the prologue to 1 John introduces the reader to important themes which will be more full developed later in the body of the work. In the case of 1 John, three of these are: (1) the importance of eyewitness testimony to who Jesus is (cf. 4:14, 5:6-12), (2) the importance of the earthly ministry of Jesus as a part of God's revelation of himself in Jesus Christ (cf. 4:2, 5:6), and (3) the eternal life available to believers in Jesus Christ (5:11-12, 5:20). Like the rest of the letter, the prologue to 1 John does not contain any of the usual features associated with a letter in NT times, such as an opening formula, the name of the author or sender, the name(s) of the addressee(s), a formal greeting, or a health wish or expression of remembrance. The author of 1 John begins the prologue with an emphasis on the eyewitness nature of his testimony. He then transitions to a focus on the readers of the letter by emphasizing the proclamation of this eyewitness (apostolic) testimony to them. The purpose of this proclamation is so that the readers might share in fellowship with the author, a true fellowship which is with the Father and the Son as well. To guarantee this maintenance of fellowship the author is writing the letter itself (line 4a). Thus, in spite of the convoluted structure of the prologue in which the author's thought turns back on itself several times, there is a discernible progression in his thought which ultimately expresses itself in the reason for the writing of the letter (later expressed again in slightly different form in the purpose statement of 5:13).<br>
 <a name="fn11" href="1jo.htm#fnB11"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  The <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>) at the beginning of 1:5 takes on a resumptive force, indicated by the phrase "heard from him and announce to you," which echoes similar phrases in 1:2 and 1:3.<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="1jo.htm#fnB12"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  The word "gospel" is not in the Greek text but is supplied to clarify the meaning. See the note on the following word "message."<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="1jo.htm#fnB13"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajggeliva</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">angelia</FONT>) occurs only twice in the NT, here and in 1 John 3:11. It is a cognate of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejpaggeliva</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">epangelia</FONT>) which occurs much more frequently (some 52 times in the NT) including 1 John 2:25. BAGD 7 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajggeliva</FONT> 1 offers the meaning "message" which suggests some overlap with the semantic range of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">lovgo"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">logos</FONT>), although in the specific context of 1:5 BAGD suggests a reference to the gospel. (The precise "content" of this "good news' is given by the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joti</FONT>] clause which follows in 1:5b.) The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajggeliva</FONT> here is closely equivalent to <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eujaggevlion</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">euangelion</FONT>): (1) it refers to the proclamation of the eyewitness testimony about the life and ministry of Jesus Christ as proclaimed by the author and the rest of the apostolic witnesses (prologue, esp. 1:3-4), and (2) it relates to the salvation of the hearers/readers, since the purpose of this proclamation is to bring them into fellowship with God and with the apostolic witnesses (1:3). Because of this the adjective "gospel" is included in the English translation.<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="1jo.htm#fnB14"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  The referent of the pronoun "him" is not entirely clear in the Greek text; it could be either (1) God the Father, or (2) Jesus Christ, both of whom are mentioned at the end of v. 3. A reference to Jesus Christ is more likely because this is the nearest possible antecedent, and because God (the Father) is specifically mentioned in the following clause in v. 5.<br>
 <a name="fn15" href="1jo.htm#fnB15"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  The key to understanding the first major section of 1 John, 1:5-3:10, is found in the statement in v. 5: "<i>God is light and in him there is no darkness at all</i>." The idea of "proclamation"--the apostolic proclamation of eyewitness testimony which the prologue introduces (1:2, 3)--is picked up in 1:5 by the use of the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajggeliva</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">angelia</FONT>) and the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajnaggevllomen</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">anangellomen</FONT>), cognate to the verb in 1:3. The content of this proclamation is given by the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joti</FONT>) clause in 1:5 as the assertion that God is light, so this statement should be understood as the author's formulation of the apostolic eyewitness testimony introduced in the prologue. (This corresponds to the apostolic preaching elsewhere referred to as <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">khvrugma</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">khrugma</FONT>], although the term the Apostle John uses here is <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajggeliva</FONT>.)<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:5)  Following the theme statement in 1:5, <i>God is light and in him there is no darkness at all</i>, the author presents a series of three claims and counterclaims that make up the first unit of 1 John (1:5-2:2). The three claims begin with "if" (1:6, 8, 10) and the three counterclaims begin with "but if" (1:7, 9; 2:1).<br>
 <a name="fn16" href="1jo.htm#fnB16"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  The context of this statement in 1:6 indicates clearly that the progressive (continuative or durative) aspect of the present tense must be in view here.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:6) <i> </i>The relationship of the phrase <i>keep on walking</i> to <i>if we say</i> is very important for understanding the problem expressed in 1:6. If one should say (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ei[pwmen</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">eipwmen</FONT>) that he has fellowship with God, and yet continues walking (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">peripatw'men</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">peripatwmen</FONT>) in the darkness, then it follows (in the apodosis, the "then" clause) that he is lying and not practicing the truth.<br>

 <a name="fn18" href="1jo.htm#fnB18"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  Or "purifies."<br>
 <a name="fn19" href="1jo.htm#fnB19"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  BAGD 43 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aJmartiva</FONT> 1 defines this term as "every departure from the way of righteousness, both human and divine" (see 1 John 5:17 where <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aJmartiva</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jamartia</FONT>] and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajdikiva</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">adikia</FONT>] are related). This word occurs 17 times in 1 John, of which 11 are singular and 6 are plural.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:7)  <i>From all sin. </i>Sometimes a distinction between singular "sin" and plural "sins" has been suggested: Some would see the singular <i>all sin</i> of 1:7 as a reference to sinfulness before conversion and the plural <i>sins</i> of 1:9 as a reference to sins committed after one became a Christian. This amounts to making 1:7 refer to initial justification and 1:9 to sanctification. But the phrase <i>all sin </i>in 1:7 is so comprehensive that it can hardly be limited to pre-conversion sins, and the emphasis on "walking" in 1:7 strongly suggests that the Christian life is in view (not one's life before conversion). In 1 John 1:8 sin appears as a condition or characteristic quality, which in 1:10 is regarded as universal. Apart from forgiveness in Christ it results in alienation from God (2:15) and spiritual death (3:14). But according to 1 John 1:7, cleansing from sin is possible by the blood (representing the sacrificial death) of Jesus.<br>
 <a name="fn20" href="1jo.htm#fnB20"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:8)  <i>Grk</i> "say we do not have sin." The use of<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek"> e[cw</FONT> + <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aJmartiva</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ecw</FONT> + <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jamartia</FONT>) is an expression limited to John and 1 John in the NT. On the analogy with other constructions where <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">e[cw</FONT> governs an abstract noun (e.g., 1 John 1:3, 6, 7; 2:28; 3:3, 15, 21; 4:16, 17; 5:12-13), it indicates that a <i>state</i> is involved, which in the case of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aJmartiva</FONT> would refer to <i>a state of sin</i>. The four times the expression <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">e[cw </FONT>+ <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aJmartiva</FONT> occurs in the Gospel of John (9:41; 15:22, 24; 19:11) all refer to situations where a wrong action has been committed or a wrong attitude has already existed, resulting in a state of sin, and then something else happens which further emphasizes the evil of that action or attitude. Here in 1 John 1:8 the sense is the same. The author is addressing people who have sinned (resulting in a state of sin), warning them that they cannot claim to be free from the guilt of that sin. The context of 1 John does not imply libertinism (where sins are flaunted as a way of demonstrating one's "liberty") on the part of the opponents, since the author makes no explicit charges of immoral behavior against his opponents. The worst the author explicitly says is that they have failed to love the brethren (1 John 3:17). It seems more likely that the opponents were saying that things a believer did after conversion were not significant enough to be "sins" that could challenge one's intimate relationship with God (a relationship the author denies that the opponents have to begin with).<br>

II.2 where 1 John 1:9 is listed as a specific example. The translation with participles ("forgiving, ...cleansing") conveys this idea of result.<br>
 <a name="fn23" href="1jo.htm#fnB23"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  Or "purifying."<br>
 <a name="fn24" href="1jo.htm#fnB24"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:1)  <i>My little children. </i>The direct address by the author to his readers at the beginning of 2:1 marks a break in the pattern of the opponents' claims (indicated by the phrase <i>if we say </i>followed by a negative statement in the apodosis, the "then" clause) and the author's counterclaims (represented by <i>if</i> with a positive statement in the apodosis) made so far in 1:6-10. The seriousness of this last claim (in 1:10) causes the author to interrupt himself to address the readers as his faithful children and to explain to them that while he wants them not to sin, they may be assured that if they do, they can look to Jesus Christ, as their advocate with the Father, to intercede for them. After this, the last of the author's three counter-claims in 1:5-2:2 is found in the <i>if </i>clause in 2:1b.<br>
 <a name="fn25" href="1jo.htm#fnB25"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:1)  There is some dispute over the significance of the aorist tense of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aJmavrthte</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jamarthte</FONT>): (1) F. Stagg ("Orthodoxy and Orthopraxy in the Johannine Epistles," <i>RevExp </i>67 [1970]:423-32, esp. 428) holds that the aorist is nondescriptive, saying nothing about the nature of the action itself, but only that the action has happened. This is indeed the normal aspectual value of the aorist tense in general, but there is some disagreement over whether with this particular verb there are more specific nuances of meaning. (2) M. Zerwick (<i>Biblical Greek</i> &#167;251) and N. Turner (MHT 3:72) agree that the <i>present</i> tense of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aJmartavnw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jamartanw</FONT>) means "to be in a state of sin" (i.e., a sinner) while the <i>aorist</i> refers to specific acts of sin. Without attempting to sort out this particular dispute, it should be noted that certain verbs do have different nuances of meaning in different tenses, nuances which do not derive solely from the aspectual value of the tense per se, but from a combination of semantic factors which vary from word to word.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:1)  <i>So that you may not sin. </i>It is clear the author is <i>not</i> simply exhorting the readers not to be habitual or repetitive sinners, as if to imply that occasional acts of sin would be acceptable. The purpose of the author here is that the readers not sin <i>at all</i>, just as Jesus told the man he healed in John 5:14 "Don't sin any more."<br>
 <a name="fn26" href="1jo.htm#fnB26"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:1)  The description of the Holy Spirit as `Paraclete' is unique to the Gospel of John (14:16, 26; 15:26; and 16:7). Here, in the only other use of the word in the NT, it is Jesus, not the Spirit, who is described as <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">paravklhto"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">paraklhto"</FONT>). The reader should have been prepared for this interchangeability of terminology, however, by John 14:16, where Jesus told the disciples that he would ask the Father to send them `another' paraclete (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">a[llo"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">allos</FONT>, "another of the same kind"). This implies that <i>Jesus himself had been a paraclete</i> in his earthly ministry to the disciples. This does not answer all the questions about the meaning of the word here, though, since it is not Jesus' role as an advocate during his earthly ministry which is in view, but his role as an advocate in heaven before the Father. The context suggests intercession in the sense of legal advocacy, as stress is placed upon the righteousness of Jesus (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">*Ihsou'n CristoVn divkaion</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Ihsoun Criston dikaion</FONT>). The concept of Jesus' intercession on behalf of believers does occur elsewhere in the NT, notably in Rom 8:34 and Heb 7:25. Something similar is taking place here, and is the best explanation of 1 John 2:1. An English translation like "advocate" or "intercessor" conveys this.<br>
 <a name="fn27" href="1jo.htm#fnB27"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:1)  Or "Jesus Christ the righteous."<br>
 <a name="fn28" href="1jo.htm#fnB28"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:2)  A suitable English translation for this word (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">iJlasmov"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jilasmos</FONT>) is a difficult and even controversial problem. "Expiation," "propitiation," and "atonement" have all been suggested. L. Morris, in a study that has become central to discussions of this topic (<i>The Apostolic Preaching of the Cross</i>, 140), sees as an integral part of the meaning of the word (as in the other words in the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">iJlavskomai</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jilaskomai</FONT>] group) the idea <i>of turning away the divine wrath</i>, suggesting that "propitiation" is the closest English equivalent. It is certainly possible to see an averting of divine wrath in this context, where the sins of believers are in view and Jesus is said to be acting as Advocate on behalf of believers. R. E. Brown's point (<i>Epistles of John</i> [AB], 220-21), that it is essentially cleansing from sin which is in view here and in the other use of the word in 4:10, is well taken, but the two connotations (averting wrath and cleansing) are not mutually exclusive and it is unlikely that the propitiatory aspect of Jesus' work should be ruled out entirely in the usage in 2:2. Nevertheless, the English word "propitiation" is too technical to communicate to many modern readers, and a term like "atoning sacrifice" (given by Webster's <i>New International Dictionary</i> as a definition of "propitiation") is more appropriate here. Another term, "satisfaction," might also convey the idea, but "satisfaction" in Roman Catholic theology is a technical term for the performance of the penance imposed by the priest on a penitent.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:2)  The Greek word (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">iJlasmov"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jilasmos</FONT>) behind the phrase <i>atoning sacrifice </i>conveys both the idea of "turning aside divine wrath" and the idea of "cleansing from sin."<br>
 <a name="fn29" href="1jo.htm#fnB29"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:2)  Many translations supply an understood repetition of the word "sins" here, thus: "but also for the sins of the whole world."<br>
 <a name="fn30" href="1jo.htm#fnB30"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:3)  The translation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>) at the beginning of 2:3 is important for understanding the argument, because a similar <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> occurs at the beginning of 1:5. The use here is not just a simple continuative or connective, but has more of a resumptive force, pointing back to the previous use in 1:5.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:3)  <i>Now. </i>The author, after discussing three claims of the opponents in 1:6, 8, and 10 and putting forward three counterclaims of his own in 1:7, 1:9, and 2:1, now returns to the theme of "God as light" introduced in 1:5. The author will now discuss how a Christian may have assurance that he or she has come to know the God who is light, again by contrast with the opponents who make the same profession of knowing God, but lack the reality of such knowledge, as their behavior makes clear.<br>
 <a name="fn31" href="1jo.htm#fnB31"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:3)  <i>Grk</i> "know him." (1) Many take the third person pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aujton</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">auton</FONT>) to refer to Jesus Christ, since he is mentioned in 2:1 and the pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aujtov"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">autos</FONT>) at the beginning of 2:2 clearly refers to him. But (2) it is more likely that God is the referent here, since (a) the assurance the author is discussing here is assurance that one has come to know God (all the claims of the opponents in 1:5-2:11 concern knowing and having fellowship with the God who is light); (b) when Jesus Christ is explicitly mentioned as an example to follow in 1 John 2:6, the pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejkei'no"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ekeinos</FONT>) is used to distinguish this from previous references with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aujtov"</FONT>; (c) the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>) which begins 2:3 is parallel to the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> which begins 1:5, suggesting that the author is now returning to the discussion of God who is light, a theme introduced in 1:5.

 <a name="fn35" href="1jo.htm#fnB35"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6)  The Greek verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mevnw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">menw</FONT>) is commonly translated into contemporary English as "remain" or "abide", but both of these translations have some problems: (1) "Abide" has become in some circles almost a `technical term' for some sort of special intimate fellowship or close relationship between the Christian and God, so that one may speak of Christians who are `abiding' and Christians who are not. It is accurate to say the word indicates a close, intimate (and permanent) relationship between the believer and God. However, it is very important to note that for the author of the Gospel of John and the Johannine Epistles <i>every </i>genuine Christian has this type of relationship with God, and the person who does not have this type of relationship (cf. 2 John 9) is not a believer at all (in spite of what he or she may claim). (2) On the other hand, to translate <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mevnw</FONT> as "remain" removes some of these problems, but creates others: in certain contexts, such a translation can give the impression that those who currently "remain" in this relationship with God can at some point choose not to "remain", that is, to abandon their faith and return to an unsaved condition. While one may easily think in terms of the author's opponents in 1 John as not "remaining," the author makes it inescapably clear in 2:19 that these people, in spite of their claims to know God and be in fellowship with God, <i>never</i> really were genuine believers.

 <b>sn</b> (2:6)  The Greek word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mevnw </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">menw</FONT>) translated <i>resides</i> indicates a close, intimate (and permanent) relationship between the believer and God. It is very important to note that for the author of the Gospel of John and the Johannine Epistles <i>every </i>genuine Christian has this type of relationship with God, and the person who does not have this type of relationship (cf. 2 John 9) is not a believer at all (in spite of what he or she may claim).<br>

But the statement following the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti </FONT>is about light and darkness, and it is difficult to see how this has anything to do with the commandment, especially as the commandment is related to the "new commandment" of John 13:34 for believers to love one another. It is far more likely that (3) the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti </FONT>clause should be understood as causal, but this still does not answer the question of whether it offers the reason for writing the "new commandment" itself or the reason for the relative clause ("that is true in him and in you"). It probably gives the reason for the writing of the commandment, although R. E. Brown (<i>Epistles of John</i> [AB], 268) thinks it refers to both.<br>

The following verse (2:11) views darkness as operative within a person, and the analogy with Ps 119:165, which says that the person who loves God's law does not stumble, expresses a similar concept in relation to an individual. This evidence suggests that the person is the referent here.<br>
 <a name="fn48" href="1jo.htm#fnB48"><sup>38</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:11)  <i>The one who hates his fellow Christian. </i>The author's paradigm for the opponents portrays them as those who show hatred for fellow Christians (<i>Grk </i>"brothers," but not referring to one's physical siblings). This charge will be much more fully developed in chap. 3, where the author will compare the opponents to Cain (who is the model for one who hates a brother, since he ultimately murdered his own brother). In 1 John 3:17 the specific charge against the opponents will be failing to give material aid to a brother in need.<br>
 <a name="fn49" href="1jo.htm#fnB49"><sup>39</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:11)  <i>1 John 2:3-11. </i>The section 2:3-11 contains three claims to intimate knowledge of God, each introduced by the phrase <i>the one who says</i> (participles in the Greek text) in 2:4, 6, and 9. As with the three claims beginning with "if" in the previous section (1:6, 8, 10), these indirectly reflect the claims of the opponents. Each claim is followed by the author's evaluation and its implications.<br>
 <a name="fn50" href="1jo.htm#fnB50"><sup>40</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:12)  <i>I am writing to you. </i>The author appears to have been concerned that some of his readers, at least, would accept the claims of the opponents as voiced in 1:6, 8, and 10. The counterclaims the author has made in 1:7, 9, and 2:1 seem intended to strengthen the readers and reassure them (among other things) that their sins are forgiven. Further assurances of their position here is in keeping with such a theme, and indeed, the topic of reassurance runs throughout the entire letter (see the purpose statement in 5:13). Finally, in such a context the warning which follows in 2:15-17 is not out of place because the author is dealing with a community that is discouraged by the controversy which has arisen within it and that is in need of exhortation.<br>
 <a name="fn51" href="1jo.htm#fnB51"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:12)  The <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joti</FONT>) that follows all six occurrences of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">gravfw</FONT>/<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">e[graya</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">grafw</FONT>/<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">egraya</FONT>) in 2:12-14 can be understood as introducing either (1) a causal clause or (2) a content clause (if content, it could be said to introduce a direct object clause or an indirect discourse clause). Many interpreters have favored a causal translation, so that in each of the six cases what follows the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> gives the reason why the author is writing to the recipients. Usage in similar constructions is not decisive because only one other instance of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">gravfw</FONT> followed by <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> occurs in 1 John (2:21), and that context is just as ambiguous as this one. On other occasions <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">gravfw</FONT> does tend to be followed by a noun or pronoun functioning as direct object. This might argue for the content usage here, but it could also be argued that the direct object in the six instances in these verses is understood, namely, the content of the entire letter itself. Thus the following <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti </FONT>clause could still be causal. Grammatical considerations aside, these uses of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> are more likely introducing content clauses here rather than causal clauses because such a meaning better fits the context. If the uses of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> are understood as causal, it is difficult to see why the author immediately gives a warning in the section that follows about loving the world. The confidence he has expressed in his readers (if the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clauses are understood as causal) would appear to be ill-founded if he is so concerned about their relationship to the world as 2:15-17 seems to indicate. On the other hand, understanding the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clauses as content clauses fits very well the context of reassurance which runs throughout the letter.<br>

Various interpretations along these lines refer to boasting about one's wealth, showing off one's possessions, boasting of one's social status or lifestyle. (2) It is also possible to understand the genitive as subjective, however, in which case the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">bivo"</FONT> itself <i>produces</i> the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajlazoneiva</FONT>. In this case, the material security of one's life and possessions produces a boastful overconfidence. This understanding better fits the context here: the focus is on people who operate purely on a human level and have no spiritual dimension to their existence. This is the person who loves the world, whose affections are all centered on the world, who has no love for God or spiritual things ("the love of the Father is not in him," 2:15).<br>

It is much more likely (2) that they arose from within the Christian communities to which John is writing, however, and with which he identifies himself. This identification can be seen in the interchange of the pronouns "we" and "you" between 1:10 and 2:1, for example, where "we" does not refer only to John and the other apostles, but is inclusive, referring to both himself and the Christians he is writing to (2:1, "you").<br>

The evidence favors the nominative reading, but it is not overwhelming. At the same time, the internal evidence supports the nominative, for a variety of reasons. A scribe would naturally tend to give the transitive verb a direct object, especially because of the parallel in the first half of the verse. And intrinsically, the argument seems to be in balance with v. 19: the "all" who have gone out and are not `in the know' with the "all" who have an anointing, and know that they are true believers. Further, as R. E. Brown points out, "the fact of their knowledge (<i>pantes</i>), not the extent of its object (<i>panta</i>), seems best to fit the reassurance" (<i>Epistles of John</i> [AB], 349). Brown further points out the connection with the new covenant in Jer 31 with this section of 1 John, esp. Jer 31: 34--"they all [<i>pantes</i>] shall know me." Since 1 John alludes to Jer 31, without directly quoting it, this is all the more reason to see the nominative as original: allusions are often overlooked by scribes (transcriptional evidence), but support the intrinsic evidence. Thus, the evidence is solidly (though not overwhelmingly) behind the nominative reading.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:20)  The statement <i>you all know</i> probably constitutes an indirect allusion to the provisions of the new covenant mentioned in Jer 31 (see especially Jer 31:34). See also R. E. Brown, <i>The Epistles of John</i> [AB], 349.<br>

(2) The first two may be causal while the third indicates content (declarative or recitative o<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">{ti</FONT>, so KJV, RSV, TEV, NRSV).

Although shorter readings are often preferred (since scribes would tend to add material rather than delete it), if an unintentional error is likely, shorter readings are generally considered secondary. This is a classic example of such an unintentional omission: the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">toVn patevra e[cei</FONT> of the preceding clause occasioned the haplography, with the scribe's eye skipping from one <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ton patera ecei</FONT> to the other.

The same phrase occurs at the beginning of 1:5, where it serves as a transitional link between the prologue (1:1-4) and the first major section of the letter (1:5-3:10). It is probably best to see the phrase here as transitional as well; thus <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>) is translated "now" rather than "and." The accusative phrase at the end of v. 25, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">thVn zwhVn thVn aijwvnion</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">thn zwhn thn aiwnion</FONT>), stands in apposition to the relative pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">h{n</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jhn</FONT>), whose antecedent is <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJ ejpaggeliva</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jh epangelia</FONT>; see BDF &#167;295).

The same verb is found in the following verse, 2:28, but the address to the readers there seems clearly to indicate an imperative. On analogy some have called for an imperative here, but others have seen this as suggesting an indicative here, so that the author is not repeating himself. An indicative is slightly more likely here. Up to this point the thrust of the author has been reassurance rather than exhortation, and an indicative here ("...you reside in him") balances the indicative in the first part of 2:27 ("the anointing which you received from him resides in you..."). With the following verse the author switches from reassurance (the readers at the time he is writing still `remain'; they have not yet adopted the teaching of the opponents) to exhortation (he is writing so that they will `remain' and not succumb to the deception of the opponents).<br>
 <a name="fn86" href="1jo.htm#fnB86"><sup>76</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:28)  Again, as at the end of 2:27, the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mevnete</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">menete</FONT>) may be read as either (1) indicative or (2) imperative mood. At the end of 2:27 the translation opted for an indicative because the author had been attempting to reassure his readers that they did indeed possess eternal life, and also because an indicative at the end of 2:27 balances the indicative reference to the "anointing" residing in the readers at the beginning of the verse. With the return in 2:28 to the eschatological note introduced in 2:18, however, it appears that the author switches from reassurance to exhortation. At the time he is writing them, the readers do still "remain" since they have not yet adopted the heretical teaching of the opponents. But now the author wants to forestall the possibility that they might do so at some point, and so he begins this section with an exhortation to the readers to "reside/remain" in Christ. This suggests that <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mevnete</FONT> in the present verse should be read as imperative rather than indicative, a view made even more probable by the following <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{na</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jina</FONT>) clause which states the purpose for the exhortation: in order that at the parousia (second advent) when Jesus Christ is revealed, the readers may have confidence and not shrink back from him in shame when he appears.<br>

Anyone who does not `remain' demonstrates (just as the opponents demonstrated by their departure from the community in 2:19) that whatever profession he has made is false and he is not truly a believer.<br>

A number of modern translations (RSV, NASB, NIV) have opted for the latter, but (3) the imagery expressed in 1 John 3:9 clearly refers to the action of the male parent in procreating a child, as does 5:1 ("everyone who loves the father loves the child fathered by him"), and so a word reflecting the action of the male parent is called for here.

Six times in the Gospel of John (5:16, 18; 8:47; 10:17; 12:18, 39) the phrase refers to what follows, and in each of these instances an epexegetical <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joti</FONT>) clause follows.

The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">diaV tou'to</FONT> is used three times in the Johannine Epistles. In two of these (1 John 4:5, 3 John 10) there is no <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause following, and so the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">diaV tou'to</FONT> should refer to preceding material.

In the immediate context, however, a better analogy is <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejfanerwvqh tiv ejsovmeqa</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">efanerwqh ti esomeqa</FONT>) in 3:2a. There the clause <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tiv ejsovmeqa</FONT> is the subject of the passive verb: "<i>what we shall be</i> has not yet been revealed." From a grammatical standpoint it makes better sense to see the understood subject of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">fanerwqh'/</FONT> as "it" rather than "he" and as referring back to the clause <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tiv ejsovmeqa</FONT> in 3:2a. In the context this makes good sense: "Beloved, now we are children of God, and <i>what we shall be</i> has not yet been revealed. We know that whenever <i>it shall be revealed</i>, we shall be like him, because we shall see him just as he is." This emphasizes the contrast in the verse between the present state ("not yet been revealed") and the future state ("shall be revealed") of believers, and this will of course take place at the parousia.<br>

 <a name="fn104" href="1jo.htm#fnB104"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:2)  The phrase <i>we will be like him, because we will see him just as he is</i> has been explained two ways: (1) believers will really become more like God than they now are, and will do this through seeing God as he really is; or (2) believers will realize that they are already like God, but did not realize it until they see him as he is. One who sees a strong emphasis on realized eschatology in the Gospel of John and the Epistles might opt for the second view, since it downplays the difference between what believers already are in the present age and what they will become in the next. It seems better, though, in light of the statement in 3:2a that "what we will be has not yet been revealed" and because of the reference to Christ's parousia in 2:28, that the author intends to distinguish between the present state of believers and what they will be like in the future. Thus the first view is better, that believers really will become more like God than they are now, as a result of seeing him as he really is.<br>

One might wonder why the author did not use the more common verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aJgiavzw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jagiazw</FONT>), as in John 17:19, where Jesus prays, "On their behalf I consecrate myself, so that they may also be consecrated in the truth." It is possible that there is some overlap between the two verbs and thus this is another example of Johannine stylistic variation, but the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aJgnivzw</FONT> is used in the context of John 11:55, which describes ritual purification for the Passover, a usage also found in the LXX (Exod 19:10-11, Num 8:21). In this context the use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aJgnivzw</FONT> would remind the readers that, if they have the future hope of entering the Father's presence ("seeing him as he is" in 3:2), they need to prepare themselves by living a purified lifestyle now, just as Jesus lived during his earthly life and ministry (cf. 2:6 again). This serves to rebut the opponents' claims to moral indifference, that what the Christian does in the present life is of no consequence.<br>

 <a name="fn110" href="1jo.htm#fnB110"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:4)  The Greek word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajnomiva </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">anomia</FONT>) is often translated "iniquity" or "lawlessness" and in the LXX refers particularly to transgression of the law of Moses. In Jewish thought the ideas of sin (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aJmartiva</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jamartia</FONT>) and lawlessness or iniquity (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajnomiva</FONT>) were often equated because sin involved a violation of the Mosaic law and hence lawlessness. For example, Ps 51:5 LXX sets the two in parallel, and Paul in Rom 4:7 (quoting Ps 32:1) does the same. For the author, it is not violation of the Mosaic law that results in lawlessness, since he is writing to Christians. The `law' for the author is the law of love, as given by Jesus in the new commandment of John 13:34-35. This is the command to love one's brother, a major theme of 1 John and the one specific sin in the entire letter which the opponents are charged with (3:17). Since the author has already labeled the opponents "antichrists" in 2:18, it may well be that he sees in their iniquitous behavior of withdrawing from the community and refusing to love the brethren a foreshadowing of the apocalyptic iniquity of the end times (cf. 2 Thess 2:3-8). In Matt 24:11-12 Jesus foretold that false prophets would arise in the end times (cf. 1 John 4:1), that lawlessness (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">anomia</FONT>) would increase, and that "the love of many will grow cold" (which would certainly fit the author's portrait of the opponents here).<br>

 <a name="fn115" href="1jo.htm#fnB115"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:6)  The interpretive problem raised by the use of the present tense <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aJmartavnei</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jamartanei</FONT>) in this verse (and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">poiei'</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">poiei</FONT>] in 3:9 as well) is that (a) it appears to teach a sinless state of perfection for the true Christian, and (b) it appears to contradict the author's own statements in 2:1-2 where he acknowledged that Christians do indeed sin. (1) One widely-used method of reconciling the acknowledgment in 2:1-2 that Christians do sin with the statements in 3:6 and 3:9 that they do not is expressed by M. Zerwick (<i>Biblical Greek</i> &#167;251). He understands the aorist to mean "commit sin in the concrete, commit some sin or other" while the present means "be a sinner, as a characteristic &#171;state&#187;." N. Turner (<i>Grammatical Insights</i>, 151) argues essentially the same as Zerwick, stating that the present tense <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aJmartavnei</FONT> is stative (be a sinner) while the aorist is ingressive (begin to be a sinner, as the initial step of committing this or that sin). Similar interpretations can be found in a number of grammatical works and commentaries. (2) Others, however, have questioned the view that the distinction in tenses alone can convey a "habitual" meaning without further contextual clarification, including C. H. Dodd (<i>The Johannine Epistles</i> [MNTC], 79) and Z. C. Hodges ("1 John," <i>BKCNT</i>, 894). B. Fanning (<i>Verbal Aspect</i>, 215-17) has concluded that the habitual meaning for the present tense cannot be ruled out, because there are clear instances of habitual presents in the NT where other clarifying words are not present and the habitual sense is derived from the context alone. This means that from a grammatical standpoint alone, the habitual present cannot be ruled out in 1 John 3:6 and 9. It is still true, however, that it would have been much clearer if the author had reinforced the habitual sense with clarifying words or phrases in 1 John 3:6 and 9 if that is what he had intended. Dodd's point, that reliance on the distinction in tenses alone is quite a subtle way of communicating such a vital point in the author's argument, is still valid. It may also be added that the author of 1 John has demonstrated a propensity for alternating between present and aorist tenses for purely stylistic reasons (see 2:12).<br>
 <b>sn</b> ()  <i>Does not sin. </i>It is best to view the distinction between "everyone who practices sin" in 3:4 and "everyone who resides in him" in 3:6 as absolute and sharply in contrast. The author is here making a clear distinction between the opponents, who as moral indifferentists downplay the significance of sin in the life of the Christian, and the readers, who as true Christians recognize the significance of sin because Jesus came to take it away (3:5) and to destroy it as a work of the devil (3:8). This argument is developed more fully by S. Kubo ("I John 3:9: Absolute or Habitual?" <i>AUSS </i>7 <sup></sup>: 47-56), who takes the opponents as Gnostics who define sin as ignorance. The opponents were probably not adherents of fully-developed gnosticism, but Kubo is right that <i>the distinction between their position and that of the true Christian is intentionally portrayed by the author here as a sharp antithesis</i>. This explanation still has to deal with the contradiction between 2:1-2 and 3:6-9, but this does not present an insuperable difficulty. The author of 1 John has repeatedly demonstrated a tendency to present his ideas antithetically, in "either/or" terms, in order to bring out for the readers the drastic contrast between themselves as true believers and the opponents as false believers. In 2:1-2 the author can acknowledge the possibility that a true Christian might on occasion sin, because in this context he wishes to reassure his readers that the statements he has made about the opponents in the preceding context do not apply to them. But in 3:4-10, his concern is to bring out the absolute difference between the opponents and his readers, so he speaks in theoretical rather than practical terms which do not discuss the possible occasional exception, because to do so would weaken his argument.<br>

However, it is significant that the author of 1 John never speaks of the opponents as "fathered by the devil" in the same sense as Christians are "fathered by God" (3:9). A concept of evildoers as "fathered" by the devil in the same sense as Christians are fathered by God would imply a much more fully developed Gnosticism with its dualistic approach to humanity. The author of 1 John carefully avoids saying that the opponents are "fathered by the devil," because in Johannine theology not to be fathered by God is to be fathered only by the flesh (John 1:13). This is a significant piece of evidence that 1 John predates the more fully developed Gnosticism of the 2nd century. What the author <i>does</i> say is that the opponents ("the one who practices sin") are <i>from</i> the devil, in the sense that they belong to him and have given him their allegiance.<br>

In John 1:27 it refers to a literal loosing of one's sandal-thong, and in John 2:19 to a destruction of Jesus' physical body which was understood by the hearers to refer to physical destruction of the Jerusalem temple. In John 5:18 it refers to the breaking of the Sabbath, in John 7:23 to the breaking of the law of Moses, and in John 10:35 to the breaking of the scriptures. The verb is again used literally in John 11:44 at the resurrection of Lazarus when Jesus commands that he be released from the graveclothes with which he was bound. Here in 1 John 3:8 the verb means, with reference to "the works of the devil," to "destroy, bring to an end, abolish, or do away with."

Here in 3:9 the distinction is sharply drawn between "the one who practices sin" in 3:8, who is of the devil, and "the one who is fathered by God" in 3:9, who "does not practice sin." See S. Kubo ("I John 3:9: Absolute or Habitual?" <i>AUSS </i>7 [1969]: 47-56) for a fuller discussion of the author's argument as based on a sharp antithesis between the recipients (true Christians) and the opponents (heretics).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:9)  <i>Does not practice sin. </i>Again, as in 3:6, the author is making a clear distinction between the opponents, who as moral indifferentists downplay the significance of sin in the life of the Christian, and the recipients, who as true Christians recognize the significance of sin because Jesus came to take it away (3:5) and to destroy it as a work of the devil (3:8). This explanation still has to deal with the apparent contradiction between the author's statements in 2:1-2 and those here in 3:9, but this is best explained in terms of the author's tendency to present issues in "either/or" terms to bring out the drastic contrast between his readers, whom he regards as true believers, and the opponents, whom he regards as false. In 2:1-2 the author can acknowledge the possibility that a true Christian might on occasion sin, because in this context he wishes to reassure his readers that the statements he has made about the opponents in the preceding context do not apply to them. But in 3:4-10, his concern is to bring out the absolute difference between the opponents and his readers, so he speaks in theoretical terms which do not discuss the possible occasional exception, because to do so would weaken his argument.<br>

On the other hand, if the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn touvtw/</FONT> refers to what follows, then the entirety of 3:10 is a summary statement at the end of 2:28-3:10 which recapitulates the section's major theme (<i>conduct is the clue to paternity</i>), and provides at the same time a transition to the theme of <i>loving one's brother</i> which will dominate the following section (3:11-24). Although R. E. Brown (<i>Epistles of John</i> [AB], 416) prefers to see the phrase as referring to the preceding material, it makes better sense to refer it to the remainder of 3:10 that follows, and see the entirety of 3:10 as both a summary of the theme of the preceding section 2:28-3:10 and a transition to the following section 3:11-24.<br>

The theme of love will dominate the second major section of the letter (see 1 John 4:8).<br>

Thus (2) <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> assumes an inferential sense, standing at the beginning of a new sentence and drawing an inference based upon all that has preceded.

 <a name="fn135" href="1jo.htm#fnB135"><sup>44</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:12)  Since the author states that <i>Cain</i>...<i>was of the evil one</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejk tou' ponhrou'</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ek tou ponhrou</FONT>), in the immediate context this imagery serves as an illustration of 3:8a: the person who practices sin is <i>of the devil</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejk tou' diabovlou</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ek tou diabolou</FONT>). This is similar to John 8:44, where Jesus told his opponents "you people are from your father the devil...[who] was a murderer from the beginning." In both Jewish and early Christian writings Cain is a model for those who deliberately disbelieve; Testament of Benjamin 7:5 looks forward to the punishment of those who "are like Cain in the envy and hatred of brothers." It is not difficult to see why the author of 1 John used Cain here as a model for the opponents in light of their failure to "love the brothers" (see 1 John 3:17).<br>

The author gives a similar reassurance to his readers in 5:13. Alternation between the verbs <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oi\da</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">oida</FONT>) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ginwvskw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ginwskw</FONT>) in 1 John is probably a matter of stylistic variation (of which the writer is extremely fond) rather than indicative of a subtle difference in meaning.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (3:14)  In John 13:1 the same Greek verb translated <i>crossed over</i> here is used to refer to Jesus' departure from this world as he returns to the Father. Here it is used figuratively to refer to the believer's transfer from the state of (spiritual) death to the state of (spiritual) life. This use is paralleled in John 5:24, where Jesus states, "the person who hears my message and believes the one who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned, but has <i>crossed over</i> (same verb) from death to life."<br>

 <b>sn</b> (3:14)  <i>Because we love our fellow Christians. </i>This echoes Jesus' words in John 13:35, where he states, "by this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another." As in 1 John 2:3 and 5, obedience becomes the basis for assurance. But the relationship between loving one's fellow Christian (<i>Grk </i>"brother") and possessing eternal life goes <i>beyond</i> a proof or external test. Our love for our fellow Christians is in fact a form of God's love for us because as far as the author of 1 John is concerned, <i>all love comes from God</i> (cf. 4:7-11). Therefore he can add the next line of 3:14, "the one who does not love remains in death." Why? Because such a person does not have God's love residing in them at all. Rather, this person can be described as a "murderer"--as the following verse goes on to do. Note also that the author's description here of the person who does not love as remaining in death is another way of describing a person who remains in darkness, which is a description of unbelievers in John 12:46. This provides further confirmation of the spiritual state of the author's opponents in 2:9-11.<br>
 <a name="fn144" href="1jo.htm#fnB144"><sup>53</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:14)  <i>The one who does not love remains in death. </i>Again, the author has the secessionist opponents in view.

 <a name="fn146" href="1jo.htm#fnB146"><sup>55</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:15)  <i>Everyone who hates his fellow Christian is a murderer. </i>On one level it is easy to see how the author could say this; the person who hates his brother is one and the same with the person who murders his brother. Behind the usage here, however, is John 8:44, the only other occurrence of the Greek word translated <i>murderer</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajnqrwpoktovno"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">anqrwpoktonos</FONT>) in the NT, where the devil is described as a "murderer from the beginning." John 8:44 refers to the devil's role in bringing death to Adam and Eve, but even more to his involvement (not directly mentioned in the Genesis account, but elaborated in the intertestamental literature, especially the writings of Philo) in Cain's murder of his brother Abel. This was the first incident of murder in human history and also the first outward demonstration of the full implications of sin's entry into the world. Ultimately, then, the devil is behind murder, just as he was behind Cain's murder of Abel. When the hater kills, he shows himself to be a child of the devil (cf. 1 John 3:10). Once again, conduct is the clue to paternity.<br>
 <a name="fn147" href="1jo.htm#fnB147"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:15)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mevnw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">menw</FONT>) in 3:15 refers to a spiritual reality (eternal life) which in this case does <i>not</i> reside in the person in question. To speak in terms of eternal life not "residing" in such an individual is not to imply that at some time in the past this person did possess eternal life and subsequently lost it, however. The previous verse (3:14) makes it clear that the individual under discussion here has "remained" in death (the realm of spiritual death) and so has <i>never</i> possessed eternal life to begin with, no matter what he may have claimed. Taken together with the use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mevnw</FONT> in 3:14, the use here implies that the opponents have "remained" in death all along, and have not ever been genuine believers. Thus "residing" rather than "remaining" is used as the translation for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mevnousan</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">menousan</FONT>) here.<br>

From John's perspective Jesus' act in giving up his life sacrificially was a voluntary one; Jesus was always completely in control of the situation surrounding his arrest, trials, and crucifixion (see John 10:18). There is a parallel with 1 John 2:6--there, as here, the life of Jesus (during his earthly ministry) becomes the <i>example</i> for believers to follow. This in turn underscores the importance of Jesus' earthly life and ministry (especially his sacrificial death on the cross), a point of contention between the author and his opponents in 1 John.

This is the only specific moral fault he ever charges the opponents with in the entire letter. It is also clear that the author sees it as impossible that such a person, who refuses to offer help in his brother's time of need (and thus `hates' his brother rather than `loving' him, cf. 3:15) can have any of the love which comes from God residing in him. This person, from the author's dualistic `either/or' perspective, <i>cannot</i> be a believer. The semantic force of the deliberative rhetorical question, "How can the love of God reside in such a person?", is therefore a declarative statement about the spiritual condition of the opponents: "The love of God cannot possibly reside in such a person."<br>
 <a name="fn155" href="1jo.htm#fnB155"><sup>64</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:17)  <i>How can the love of God reside in such a person? </i>is a rhetorical question which clearly anticipates a negative answer: The love of God <i>cannot</i> reside in such a person.<br>

If the two pairs of nouns are compared, however, it is hard to see how the second noun <i>with tongue</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">glwvssh/</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">glwssh</FONT>) in the first pair can have an adverbial sense. (2) It seems better to understand the first noun in each pair as <i>produced</i> by the second noun: words are produced by the tongue, and the (righteous) deeds with which believers are to love one another are produced by the truth.<br>
 <a name="fn157" href="1jo.htm#fnB157"><sup>66</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:19)  Once again there is the problem of deciding whether the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn touvtw/</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">en toutw</FONT>) refers (1) to what precedes or (2) to what follows.

Here there are no less than <i>three</i> <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clauses that follow, one in 2:19 and two in 3:20, and thus there is the difficulty of trying to determine whether any one of them is related to the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn touvtw/</FONT> phrase in 3:19. It is relatively easy to eliminate the first <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause (in 3:19) from consideration, because it is related not to <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn touvtw/</FONT> but to the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">gnwsovmeqa</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">gnwsomeqa</FONT>) as an indirect discourse clause giving the content of what believers know ("that we are of the truth"). As far as the two <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clauses in 3:20 are concerned, it is difficult to see how believers could know that they belong to the truth (19a) by means of either, since the first speaks of a situation where they are under self-condemnation ("if our heart condemns us...") and the second <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause seems to give a further explanation related to the first ("that God is greater than our heart..."). Therefore it seems better to understand the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn touvtw/</FONT> in 3:19 as referring to the preceding context, and this makes perfectly good sense, because 3:18 concludes with a reference to the righteous deeds with which believers are to love one another, which are produced by the truth.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:19)  <i>By this </i>refers to the righteous deeds mentioned at the end of 3:18, the expressions of love. It is by doing these deeds that believers assure themselves that they belong to the truth, because the outward action reflects the inward reality of their relationship with God. Put another way, `conduct is the clue to paternity.'<br>
 <a name="fn158" href="1jo.htm#fnB158"><sup>67</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:19)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">peivqw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">peiqw</FONT>) in the active voice (with the exception of the second perfect and pluperfect) means (a) "to convince"; (b) "to persuade, appeal to"; (c) "to win over, strive to please"; or (d) "to conciliate, pacify, set at ease or rest" (BAGD 639 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">peivqw</FONT>). Interpreters are generally divided between meaning (a) and meaning (d) for the verb in the present context, with BAGD opting for the latter (although it is conveniently pointed out that the text is "not in good order"). In any case the object of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">peivqw</FONT> in this context is <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kardiva</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kardia</FONT>), and this leads to further problems because the meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kardiva</FONT> will affect one's understanding of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">peivsomen</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">peisomen</FONT>) here.<br>
 <a name="fn159" href="1jo.htm#fnB159"><sup>68</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:19)  Further difficulties are created by the meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kardiva</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kardia</FONT>) in 3:19. Although it may be agreed that the term generally refers to the "center and source of the whole inner life, with its thinking, feeling, and volition" (BAGD 403 s.v. l.b), this may be further subdivided into references to (a) "the faculty of thought...as the organ of natural and spiritual enlightenment," that is, the mind; (b) "the will and its decisions"; (c) "the emotions, wishes, desires," i.e., the emotions or feelings; or (d) "moral decisions, the moral life," that is, the part of the individual where moral decisions are made, which is commonly called the conscience. Thus <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kardiva</FONT> in 3:19 could refer to either the mind, the will, the emotions, or the conscience, and it is not transparently clear which concept the author has primarily in view. In light of the overall context, which seems to discuss the believer's assurance of his or her standing before God (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">e[mprosqen aujtou'</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">emprosqen autou</FONT>] in 3:19 and the mention of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">parrhsiva</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">parrhsia</FONT>, "boldness" or "confidence"] in 3:21) it seems probable that the <i>conscience</i>, that aspect of one's <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kardiva</FONT> which involves moral choices and the guilt or approval for having made them, is primarily in view here. Thus the meaning "convince" is preferred for the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">peivqw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">peiqw</FONT>), since the overall subject seems to be the believer's assurance of his or her standing before God, especially in the case when (v. 20) the believer's conscience attempts to condemn him on account of sin.<br>

(1) Some interpreters have tried to see a subtle distinction in meaning between the two in 3:19 and 22, but (2) as BDF &#167;214.6 points out, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">e[mprosqen</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejnwvpion</FONT>, along with a third classical expression <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejnantivon</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">enantion</FONT>), all refer to being in someone's presence and are essentially interchangeable.

There are two other instances of the combination <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti ejavn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joti ean</FONT>) in 1 John, 3:2 and 5:14. In 3:14 the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clearly introduces an indirect discourse (content) clause following <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oi[damen</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">oidamen</FONT>). In 5:14 the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> is epexegetical to a preceding statement ("and this is the confidence [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJ parrhsiva</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jh parrhsia</FONT>] which we have before him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us"). This is analogous to the present situation, and the subject under discussion (the believer's confidence before God) is also similar (cf. 3:21-22). It is thus more likely, by analogy, that the first <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause in 3:20, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti ejaVn kataginwvskh/ hJmw'n hJ kardiva</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">{oti ean kataginwskh Jhmwn Jh kardia</FONT>), should also be understood as epexegetical to the preceding clause, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">e[mprosqen aujtou' peivsomen thVn kardivan</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">emprosqen autou peisomen thn kardian</FONT>, "and we convince our heart before him").<br>

In Job 42:6 LXX (Symmachus) and Ezek 16:61 LXX (Symmachus) it is used of self-judgment or self-condemnation, and this usage is also found in the intertestamental literature (Sir 14:2). Testament of Gad 5:3 describes a person <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oujc uJp* a[llou kataginwskovmeno" ajll* uJpoV th'" ijdiva" kardiva"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ouc Jup</FONT>'<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl"> a[llou kataginwskomeno" all</FONT>'<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl"> Jupo th" idia" kardia"</FONT>, "condemned not by another but by his own heart"). Thus the word has legal or forensic connotations, and in this context refers to the believer's self-condemnation resulting from a guilty conscience concerning sin.<br>

In both those instances the second <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> was understood as causal, and (1) some interpreters would do the same here. Unless one understands <i>both</i> of the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clauses in 3:20 as causal, however (an option rejected based on the analogy with 5:14, see the discussion in the previous note on the present verse), the first <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause must be understood as parenthetical in order for the second to be causal. This results in an even more awkward construction. It seems most probable that (2) the second <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause in 3:20 should also be understood as epexegetical (explanatory), and resumptive to the first. The resultant meaning is as follows: "and we convince our heart before him, <i>that</i> if our heart condemns us, <i>that</i> God is greater than our heart and knows all things."<br>

The <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{na</FONT> thus introduces a clause which is (1) epexegetical (explanatory) or (2) appositional.

The subject matter is so clearly different from the surrounding context that these clearly constitute separate units of thought. Since the Holy Spirit is not the only spirit active in the world, the author needs to qualify for the recipients how to tell if a spirit comes from God. The "test" is the confession in 4:2.<br>
 <a name="fn176" href="1jo.htm#fnB176"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:1)  According to BAGD 202 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dokimavzw</FONT> 1 the verb means "<i>put to the test, examine</i>."<br>
 <a name="fn177" href="1jo.htm#fnB177"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:1)  <i>Test the spirits. </i>Since in the second half of the present verse the author mentions "false prophets" who have "gone out into the world," it appears highly probable that his concept of testing the spirits is drawn from the OT concept of testing a prophet to see whether he is a false prophet or a true one. The procedure for testing a prophet is found in Deut 13:2-6 and 18:15-22. An OT prophet was to be tested on the basis of (a) whether or not his predictive prophecies came true (Deut 18:22) and (b) whether or not he advocated idolatry (Deut 13:1-3). In the latter case the people of Israel are warned that even if the prophet should perform an authenticating sign or wonder, his truth or falsity is still to be judged on the basis of his claims, that is, whether or not he advocates idolatry. Here in 1 John the idea of "testing the spirits" comes closer to the second OT example of "testing the prophets" mentioned above. According to 1 John 4:2-3, the spirits are to be tested on the basis of their christological confession: the person motivated by the Spirit of God will confess <i>Jesus as the Christ who has come in the flesh</i>, while the person motivated by the spirit of deceit will not <i>confess Jesus</i> and is therefore not from God. This comes close to the idea expressed by Paul in 1 Cor 12:3 where the person speaking charismatic utterances is also to be judged on the basis of his christological confession: "Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, `Jesus is anathema,' and no one is able to say `Jesus is Lord,' except by the Holy Spirit."<br>

 <a name="fn182" href="1jo.htm#fnB182"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:2)  This forms part of the author's christological confession which serves as a test of the spirits. Many interpreters have speculated that the author of 1 John is here correcting or adapting a slogan of the secessionist opponents, but there is no concrete evidence for this in the text. Such a possibility is mere conjecture (see R. E. Brown, <i>Epistles of John </i>[AB], 492). The phrase may be understood in a number of different ways, however: (1) the entire phrase "Jesus Christ come in the flesh" may be considered the single object of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJmologei'</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jomologei</FONT>; so B. F. Westcott, A. Brooke, J. Bonsirven, R. E. Brown, S. Smalley, and others); (2) the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJmologei'</FONT> may be followed by a double accusative, so that both "Jesus Christ" and "come in the flesh" are objects of the verb; the meaning would be "confess Jesus Christ as come in the flesh" (so B. Weiss, J. Chaine, and others). (3) Another possibility is to see the verb as followed by a double accusative as in (2), but in this case the first object is "Jesus" and the second is "the Christ come in the flesh," so that what is being confessed is "Jesus <i>as</i> the Christ come in the flesh" (so N. Alexander, J. Stott, J. Houlden, and others). All three options are grammatically possible, although not equally probable. Option (1) has a number of points in its favor: (a) the parallel in 2 John 7 suggests to some that the phrase should be understood as a single object; (b) option (2) makes "Jesus Christ" the name of the preincarnate second Person of the Trinity, and this would be the <i>only</i> place in the Johannine literature where such a designation for the preincarnate <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Lovgo"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Logos</FONT>) occurs; and (d) option (3) would have been much clearer if <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Cristovn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Criston</FONT>) were accompanied by the article (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJmologei' *Ihsou'n toVn Cristovn</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jomologei Ihsoun ton Criston</FONT>). Nevertheless option (3) is preferred on the basis of the overall context involving the secessionist opponents: their christological views would allow the confession of the Christ come in the flesh (perhaps in the sense of the Spirit indwelling believers, although this is hard to prove), but they would have trouble confessing that <i>Jesus</i> was (exclusively) the Christ incarnate. The author's failure to repeat the qualifying phrases (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">CristoVn ejn sarkiV ejlhluqovta</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Criston en sarki elhluqota</FONT>) in the negative repetition in 4:3a actually suggests that the stress is on <i>Jesus</i> as the confession the opponents could not or would not make. It is difficult to see how the parallel in 2 John 7 favors option (1), although R. E. Brown (<i>Epistles of John </i>[AB]<i>, </i>492) thinks it does. The related or parallel construction in John 9:22 (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejavn ti" aujtoVn oJmologhvsh/ Cristovn</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ean ti" auton Jomologhsh Criston</FONT>) provides further support for option (3). This is discounted by R. E. Brown because the verb in John 9:22 occurs between the two accusative objects rather than preceding both as here (<i>Epistles of John </i>[AB], 493--although Brown does mention Rom 10:9 as another parallel closer in grammatical structure to 1 John 4:2). Brown does not mention the textual variants in John 9:22, however: both <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>66<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek"> </FONT>and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>75 (along with K, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Euml;</FONT><sup>13</sup> and others) read <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJmologhvsh/ aujtoVn Cristovn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jomologhsh auton Criston</FONT>). This structure exactly parallels 1 John 4:2, and a case can be made that this is actually the preferred reading in John 9:22; furthermore, it is clear from the context in John 9:22 that <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Cristovn</FONT> is the complement (what is predicated of the first accusative) since the object (the first accusative) is <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aujtovn</FONT> rather than the proper name <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">*Ihsou'n</FONT>. The parallel in John 9:22 thus appears to be clearer than either 1 John 4:2 or 2 John 7, and thus to prove useful in understanding both the latter constructions.<br>

Although 4:1a is ambiguous and might refer either to human spirits or spiritual beings who influence people, it is clear in the context that (2) the author sees behind the secessionist opponents with their false Christology the spirit of the Antichrist, that is, Satan (4:3b), and behind the true believers of the community to which he is writing, the Spirit of God (4:2). This is made clear in 4:4 by the reference to the respective spirits as <i>the One who is in you</i> and <i>the one who is in the world</i>.<br>
 <a name="fn191" href="1jo.htm#fnB191"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:7)  This <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joti</FONT>) is causal, giving the reason why the readers, as believers, ought to love one another: because love comes from God. The next clause, introduced by <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>), does not give a second reason (i.e., is not related to the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause), but introduces a second and additional thought: everyone who loves is fathered by God and knows God.<br>
 <a name="fn192" href="1jo.htm#fnB192"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:7)  As in 2:23 and 3:4, the author uses <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pa'"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">pas</FONT>) with the present articular participle as a generalization to describe a category of people.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (4:7)  From the author's "either/or" perspective (which tends to see things in terms of polar opposites) the use of a generalization like <i>everyone who</i> presents a way of categorizing the opponents on the one hand and the recipients, whom the author regards as genuine Christians, on the other. Thus <i>everyone who loves</i> refers to all true Christians, who give evidence by their love for one another that they have indeed been begotten by God and are thus God's children. The opposite situation is described in the following verse, 4:8, where (although <i>everyone</i> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pa'"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">pas</FONT>] is omitted) it is clear that a contrast is intended.<br>
 <a name="fn193" href="1jo.htm#fnB193"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:7)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">gennavw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">gennaw</FONT>) in this context means <i>to be fathered by God</i> and thus a child of God. The imagery in 1 John is that of the male parent who fathers children (see especially 3:9 and 5:1).<br>
 <a name="fn194" href="1jo.htm#fnB194"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:8)  The author proclaims in 4:8 <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJ qeoV" ajgavph ejstivn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jo qeo" agaph estin</FONT>), but from a grammatical standpoint this is not a proposition in which subject and predicate nominative are interchangeable ("God is love" does not equal "love is God"). The predicate noun is anarthrous, as it is in two other Johannine formulas describing God, "God is light" in 1 John 1:5 and "God is Spirit" in John 4:24. The anarthrous predicate suggests a qualitative force, not a mere abstraction, so that a quality of God's character is what is described here.<br>
 <a name="fn195" href="1jo.htm#fnB195"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:9)  Once again there is the problem of determining whether the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn touvtw/</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">en toutw</FONT>) refers (1) to what precedes or (2) to what follows. This is the first of 5 uses of the phrase in the present section (4:9, 10, 13, 17; 5:2). In this case (as also in the next two instances) there is a <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joti</FONT>) clause following which is related and which explains (i.e., which is epexegetical to) the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn touvtw/</FONT>. Thus the meaning here is, "<i>By this</i> the love of God is revealed in us: <i>that</i> God has sent his only Son into the world in order that we might live through him."<br>
 <a name="fn196" href="1jo.htm#fnB196"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:9)  In terms of syntax the force of the genitive <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tou' qeou'</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">tou qeou</FONT>) may be (1) objective, (2) subjective, or (3) both. The phrase occurs for the first time in the letter in 2:5. Here in 4:9 the epexegetical <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joti</FONT>) clause which follows makes it clear that this is a subjective genitive, emphasizing <i>God's love for us</i> rather than our love for God, because it describes God's action in sending his Son into the world.<br>
 <a name="fn197" href="1jo.htm#fnB197"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:9)  This phrase is best understood as the equivalent of a dative of sphere, but this description does not specify <i>where</i> the love of God is revealed with regard to believers: "in our midst" (i.e., among us) or "within us" (i.e., internally within believers). The latter is probable, because in the context the concept of God's indwelling of the believer is mentioned in 4:12: "God resides (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mevnei</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">menei</FONT>) in us."<br>
 <a name="fn198" href="1jo.htm#fnB198"><sup>24</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:9)  Although the word translated <i>one and only</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">monogenhv"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">monogenhs</FONT>) is often rendered "only begotten," such a translation is misleading, since in English it appears to express a metaphysical relationship. The word in Greek was used of an only child (a son [Luke 7:12, 9:38] or a daughter [Luke 8:42]). It was also used of something unique (only one of its kind) such as the mythological bird called the Phoenix (1 Clement 25:2). From here it passes easily to a description of Isaac (Heb 11:17 and Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 1.13.1 [1.222]) who was not Abraham's <i>only</i> son, but was one-of-a-kind because he was the child of the promise. Thus the word means "one-of-a-kind" and is reserved for Jesus alone in the Johannine literature of the NT. While all Christians are children of God (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tevkna qeou'</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">tekna qeou</FONT>), Jesus is God's Son in a unique, one-of-a-kind sense. The word is used in this way in all its uses in the Gospel of John (1:14, 18; 3:16, 18).<br>
 <a name="fn199" href="1jo.htm#fnB199"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:10)  Once again there is the (by now familiar) problem of determining whether the referent of this phrase (1) precedes or (2) follows. Here there are two <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joti</FONT>) clauses which follow, both of which are epexegetical to the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn touvtw/</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">en toutw</FONT>) and explain what the love of God consists of: first, stated negatively, "not that we have loved God," and then positively, "but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins."<br>
 <a name="fn200" href="1jo.htm#fnB200"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:10)  The two <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joti</FONT>) clauses are epexegetical to the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn touvtw/</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">en toutw</FONT>) which begins the verse.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (4:10)  What is important (as far as the author is concerned) is not whether we love God (or say that we love God--a claim of the opponents is probably behind this), but that God has <i>loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice</i> which removes believers' <i>sins</i>. This latter point is similar to the point made in 2:2 and is at the heart of the author's dispute with the opponents, because they were denying any salvific value to Jesus' earthly life and ministry, including his death on the cross.<br>
 <a name="fn201" href="1jo.htm#fnB201"><sup>27</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:10)  As explained at 2:2, inherent in the meaning of the word translated <i>atoning sacrifice </i>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">iJlasmov"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jilasmos</FONT>) is the idea of turning away the divine wrath, so that "propitiation" is the closest English equivalent. God's love for us is expressed in his sending his Son to be the propitiation (the propitiatory sacrifice) for our sins on the cross. This is an indirect way for the author to allude to one of the main points of his controversy with the opponents: the significance for believers' salvation of Jesus' earthly life and ministry, including especially his sacrificial death on the cross. The contemporary English "atoning sacrifice" communicates this idea more effectively.<br>
 <a name="fn202" href="1jo.htm#fnB202"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:11)  <i>Grk</i> "and." The Greek conjunction <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>) introduces the apodosis of the conditional sentence.<br>
 <a name="fn203" href="1jo.htm#fnB203"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:11)  This is a first-class conditional sentence with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ei</FONT>) + aorist indicative in the protasis. Reality is assumed for the sake of argument with a first-class condition.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (4:11)  The author here assumes the reality of the protasis (the "if" clause), which his recipients, as believers, would also be expected to agree with: assuming that <i>God </i>has<i> loved us</i> in this way, then it follows that<i> we also ought to love one another.</i> God's act of love in sending his Son into the world to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins (v. 10) ought to motivate us as believers to love one another in a similar sacrificial fashion. The author made the same point already in 1 John 3:16. But this failure to show love for fellow believers is just what the opponents are doing: in 1 John 3:17 the author charged them with refusing to love their brothers by withholding needed material assistance. By their failure to love the brothers sacrificially according to the example Jesus set for believers, the opponents have demonstrated again the falsity of their claims to love God and know God (see 1 John 2:9).<br>
 <a name="fn204" href="1jo.htm#fnB204"><sup>30</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:12)  An allusion to John 1:18.<br>
 <a name="fn205" href="1jo.htm#fnB205"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:12)  The phrase "God resides in us" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJ qeoV" ejn hJmi'n mevnei</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jo qeo" en Jhmin menei</FONT>) in 4:12 is a reference to the permanent relationship which God has with the believer. Here it refers specifically to God's indwelling of the believer in the person of the Holy Spirit, as indicated by 4:13b. Since it refers to state and not to change of status it is here translated "resides" (see 2:6).<br>
 <a name="fn206" href="1jo.htm#fnB206"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:12)  The phrase "his [God's] love is perfected (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">teteleiwmevnh ejstivn</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">teteleiwmenh estin</FONT>) in us" in 4:12 is difficult. First it is necessary to decide whether <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aujtou'</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">autou</FONT>), which refers to God, is (1) subjective (God's love for us) or (2) objective (our love for God). It is clear that a subjective genitive, stressing God's love for us, is in view here, because the immediate context, 4:11a, has believers as the objects of God's love (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJ qeoV" hjgavphsen hJma'"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jo qeo" hgaphsen Jhma"</FONT>). The entire phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJ ajgavph aujtou' ejn hJmi'n teteleiwmevnh ejstivn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jh agaph autou en Jhmin teteleiwmenh estin</FONT>) then refers to what happens when believers love one another (note the protasis of the conditional sentence in 4:12, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejavn ajgapw'men ajllhvlou"</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ean agapwmen allhlou"</FONT>]). The love that comes from God, the love that he has for us, reaches perfection in our love for others, which is what God wants and what believers are commanded to do (see 3:23b).<br>
 <a name="fn207" href="1jo.htm#fnB207"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:13)  Again whether the referent of the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn touvtw/</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">en toutw</FONT>) (1) precedes or (2) follows is a problem. This time there are two <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joti</FONT>) clauses which follow. The first is an indirect discourse clause related to <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ginwvskomen</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ginwskomen</FONT>) and giving the content of <i>what</i> believers know: "that we reside in him and he in us." The second <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause is epexegetical (or explanatory) to the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn touvtw/</FONT> phrase, explaining <i>how</i> believers know that they reside in God and God remains in them: "in that he has given us of his Spirit."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (4:13)  <i>By this we know. </i>According to the author of 1 John, the Father's giving of the indwelling Holy Spirit to the believer is one means of providing assurance to the believer of his relationship to God. This is what was also stated in 1 John 3:24b in essentially identical terms.<br>
 <a name="fn208" href="1jo.htm#fnB208"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:13)  <i>Grk</i> "in him." Context indicates that the pronoun refers to God (see 4:12).<br>
 <a name="fn209" href="1jo.htm#fnB209"><sup>35</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:13)  The genitive <i>of his Spirit</i> here, like the phrase in 3:24, probably reflects a partitive nuance, so that the author portrays God as `apportioning' his Spirit to individual believers. This leads to the important observation that the author is not particularly interested in emphasizing (1) the ongoing <i>interior</i> witness of the Holy Spirit (which is what the passage is often understood to mean) but is emphasizing (2) the <i>fact</i> that God has given the Spirit to believers, and it is this fact that gives believers assurance of their relationship to God. In other words, it is the <i>fact</i> that the Holy Spirit has been given to believers, rather than the ongoing interior testimony of the Holy Spirit within the believer, which is the primary source of the believer's assurance.<br>
 <a name="fn210" href="1jo.htm#fnB210"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:14)  Because <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">swth'ra</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">swthra</FONT>) is the object complement of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uiJovn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Juion</FONT>) in a double accusative construction in 4:14, there is an understood equative verb joining the two, with the resultant meaning "the Father sent the Son <i>to be</i> the Savior of the world."<br>

In this case the past action is specified as the recognition of (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejgnwvkamen</FONT>) and belief in (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pepisteuvkamen</FONT>) "the love which God has in us." But what is the relationship between the two verbs <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ginwvskw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ginwskw</FONT>) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pisteuvw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">pisteuw</FONT>)? (1) Some interpreters would see a different nuance in each. (2) But in the Gospel of John the two verbs frequently occur together in the same context, often in the same tense; examples may be found in John 6:69, 8:31-32, 10:38, 14:7-10, and 17:8. They also occur together in one other context in 1 John, 4:1-2. Of these John 6:69, Peter's confession, is the closest parallel to the usage here: "We have come to <i>believe</i> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pepisteuvkamen</FONT>] and to<i> know</i> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejgnwvkamen</FONT>] that you are the holy One of God." Here the order between "knowing" and "believing" is reversed from 1 John 4:16, but an examination of the other examples from the Gospel of John should make it clear that there is no difference in meaning when the order of the terms is reversed. It appears that the author considered both terms to describe a single composite action. Thus they represent a hendiadys which describes an act of faith/belief/trust on the part of the individual; knowledge (true knowledge) is an inseparable part of this act of faith.<br>
 <a name="fn214" href="1jo.htm#fnB214"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:16)  The force of the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">en</FONT>) in the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn hJmi'n</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">en Jhmin</FONT>) in 4:16a is disputed: although (1) "for" (in the sense of "on behalf of") is possible and is a common English translation, the other uses of the same phrase in 4:9 (where it refers to God's love for us) and 4:12 (where it refers to God's indwelling of the believer) suggest that (2) the author intends to emphasize <i>interiority</i> here--a reference to God's love expressed <i>in</i> believers. This is confirmed by the only other uses in 1 John of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">e[cw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ecw</FONT>) with the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn</FONT> (3:15 and 5:10) both of which literally mean something <i>in</i> someone.<br>

 <a name="fn216" href="1jo.htm#fnB216"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:17)  The referent of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn touvtw/</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">en toutw</FONT>) here is more difficult to determine than most, because while there are both <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{na</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jina</FONT>) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joti</FONT>) clauses following, it is not clear whether or not they are related to the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn touvtw/</FONT>. There are actually three possibilities for the referent of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn touvtw/</FONT> in 4:17: (1) it may refer to the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{na</FONT> clause which immediately follows, so that the love of believers is brought to perfection <i>in that</i> they have confidence in the day of judgment. The main problem with this interpretation is that since the day of judgment is still future, it necessitates understanding the second use of the preposition "in" (second <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">en</FONT>]) to mean "about" or "concerning" with reference to the day of judgment in order to make logical sense. (2) The <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn touvtw/</FONT> may refer to the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause in 4:17b, meaning "love is perfected with us...<i>in that</i> just as he [Christ] is, so also are we in this world." This makes logical sense, and there are numerous cases where <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn touvtw/</FONT> is explained by a <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause that follows. However, according to this understanding the intervening <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{na</FONT> clause is awkward, and there is no other instance of the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn touvtw/</FONT> explained by a following <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause where a <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{na</FONT> clause intervenes between the two in this way. (3) Thus, the third possibility is that <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn touvtw/</FONT> refers to what <i>precedes</i> in 4:16b, and this also would make logical sense: "By this--by our residing in love so that we reside in God and he resides in us--is love brought to perfection with us." This has the additional advantage of agreeing precisely with what the author has already said in 4:12: "If we love one another, God remains in us and his love is brought to perfection in us." Thus option (3) is best, with the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn touvtw/</FONT> referring to what precedes in 4:16b, and the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{na</FONT> clause which follows indicates the <i>result</i> of this perfection of love in believers: in the future day of judgment they will have confidence. The <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause would then give the <i>reason</i> for such confidence in the day of judgment: because just as Jesus is, so also are believers in this world--they are already currently in relationship with God just as Jesus is.<br>
 <a name="fn217" href="1jo.htm#fnB217"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:17)  The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">metav</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">meta</FONT>) means "with" and modifies the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">teteleivwtai</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">teteleiwtai</FONT>). If the prepositional phrase modified the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJ ajgavph</FONT> which immediately precedes it, it would almost certainly have the Greek article, thus: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJ ajgavph hJ meq* hJmw'n</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jh agaph Jh meq</FONT>'<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl"> Jhmwn</FONT>).<br>

 <a name="fn218" href="1jo.htm#fnB218"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:17)  <i>Grk</i> "that one" (a reference to Jesus is indicated in the context). Once more the author uses the pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejkei'no"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ekeinos</FONT>) to refer to Jesus Christ, as he did in 2:6; 3:3, 5, 7, and 16. A reference to Christ is confirmed in this context because the author says that "just as he is, so also are we [believers] <i>in this world</i>" and since 3:2 indicated that believers are to be like God in the future (but are not yet), the only one believers can be like already in the present age is Jesus Christ.<br>
 <a name="fn219" href="1jo.htm#fnB219"><sup>45</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:18)  The entire phrase <i>fear has to do with punishment</i> may be understood in two slightly different ways: (1) "fear has its own punishment" or (2) "fear has to do with [includes] punishment." These are not far apart, however, and the real key to understanding the expression lies in the meaning of the word "punishment" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kovlasi"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kolasis</FONT>). While it may refer to torture or torment (BAGD 440 s.v. 1) there are numerous Koine references involving eternal punishment (2 Macc 4:38; <i>T. Reu.</i> 5:5; <i>T. Gad</i> 7:5) and this is also the use in the only other NT reference, Matt 25:46. In the present context, where the author has mentioned having <i>confidence in the day of judgment</i> (4:17), it seems virtually certain that eternal punishment (or fear of it) is what is meant here. The (only) alternative to perfected love, which results in confidence at the day of judgment, is fear, which has to do with the punishment one is afraid of receiving at the judgment. As 4:18b states, "<i>the one who fears [punishment] has not been perfected in love</i>. It is often assumed by interpreters that the opposite to <i>perfected</i> love (which casts out fear) is <i>imperfect</i> love (which still has fear and therefore no assurance). This is possible, but it is not likely, because the author nowhere mentions `imperfect' love, and for him the opposite of `perfected' love appears to be not imperfect love but hate (cf. 4:20). In other words, in the antithetical (`either/or') categories in which the author presents his arguments, one is either a genuine believer, who becomes `perfected' in love as he resides in love and in a mutually indwelling relationship with God (cf. 4:16b), <i>or</i> one is not a genuine believer at all, but one who (like the opponents) hates his brother, is a liar, and does not know God at all. This individual should well fear judgment and eternal punishment because in the author's view that is precisely where such a person is headed.<br>

There are three ways in which the second half of 5:1 has been understood: (1) as a general statement, proverbial in nature, applying to any parent: "everyone who loves the father also loves the child fathered by him." (2) This has also been understood as a statement that is particularly true of one's own parent: "everyone who loves his own father also loves the (other) children fathered by him (i.e., one's own brothers and sisters)." (3) This could be understood as a statement which refers particularly to God, in light of the context (5:1a): "everyone who loves God who fathered Christians also loves the Christians who are fathered by God." Without doubt options (2) and (3) are implications of the statement in its present context, but it seems most probable that the meaning of the statement is more general and proverbial in nature (option 1). This is likely because of the way in which it is introduced by the author with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pa'" oJ</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">pas Jo</FONT>) + participle. The author could have been more explicit and said something like, "everyone who loves God also loves God's children" had he intended option (3) without ambiguity. Yet that, in context, is the ultimate <i>application</i> of the statement, because it ultimately refers to the true Christian who, because he loves God, also loves the brethren, those who are God's offspring. This is the opposite of 4:20, where the author asserted that the opponents, who profess to love God but do not love the brethren, cannot really love God because they do not love the brethren.<br>

The <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">gavr</FONT> draws an inference based on the preceding statements, particularly the one in 5:2b, regarding the love of God. If in 5:2 loving God and keeping his commandments is the key to knowing that we love God's children, it is important to define what the love of God involves, and this is what the author is doing in 5:3. In fact, as the following <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{na</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jina</FONT>) clause makes clear, loving God consists in keeping his commandments<br>
 <a name="fn236" href="1jo.htm#fnB236"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:3)  Once again the genitive could be understood as (1) objective, (2) subjective, or (3) both.

However, BDF &#167;138.1 explains that "the neuter is sometimes used with respect to persons if it is not the individuals but a generic quality that is to be emphasized"; this seems to be the case here, where a collective aspect is in view: as a group, all those who have been begotten by God, that is, all true believers, overcome the world.<br>

This suggests that what the author has in mind here is a victory over the opponents, who now belong to the <i>world</i> and speak its language (cf. 4:5). In the face of the opponents' attempts through their false teaching to confuse the readers (true believers) about who it is they are supposed to love, the author assures the readers that loving God and keeping his commandments assures us that we really do love God's children, and because we have already achieved victory over the world through our faith, keeping God's commandments is not a difficult matter.<br>

One alternative would be "conquest," although R. E. Brown (<i>Epistles of John</i> [AB], 570) suggests "conquering power" as a translation for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJ nivkh</FONT> since here it is a metonymy for the means of victory or the power that gives victory, referring to believers' faith.<br>
 <a name="fn245" href="1jo.htm#fnB245"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:4)  The use of the aorist participle (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJ nikhvsasa</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jh nikhsasa</FONT>) to refer to faith as the conquering power that "has conquered the world" in 5:4b is problematic. Debate here centers over the temporal value of the aorist participle: (1) It may indicate an action contemporaneous with the (present tense) main verb, in which case the alternation between aorist participle in 5:4b and present participle in 5:5 is one more example of the author's love of stylistic variation with no difference in meaning. (2) Nevertheless, an aorist participle with a present tense main verb would normally indicate an action antecedent to that of the main verb, so that the aorist participle would describe a past action. That is the most probable here. Thus the aorist participle stresses that the conquest of the world is something that has already been accomplished.<br>

As in 4:15, such a confession constitutes a problem for the author's opponents but not for his readers who are genuine believers.<br>

Some have taken it (2) as declarative, giving the <i>content</i> of the Spirit's testimony: "and the Spirit is the One who testifies that the Spirit is the truth." This is certainly possible, since a <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause following the cognate verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">marturevw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">marturevw</FONT>) often gives the content of the testimony (cf. John 1:34; 3:28; 4:39, 44). But in the Gospel of John the Spirit never bears witness on his own behalf, but always on behalf of Jesus (John 15:26, 16:13). There are, in fact, some instances in the Gospel of John where a <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause following <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">marturevw</FONT> is <i>causal</i> (8:14, 15:27), and that is more likely here: "and the Spirit is the One who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth."<br>
 <a name="fn248" href="1jo.htm#fnB248"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:7)  A second causal <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joti</FONT>) clause (after the one at the end of the preceding verse) is somewhat awkward, especially since the reasons offered in each are somewhat different. The content of the second <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause (the one in question here) goes somewhat beyond the content of the first. The first <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause, the one at the end of 5:6, stated the <i>reason</i> why the Spirit is the witness: because the Spirit is the truth. The second <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause, here, states that there are three witnesses, of which the Spirit is one. It is probably best, therefore, to understand this second <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> as indicating a somewhat looser connection than the first, not strictly causal but inferential in sense (the English translation "for" captures this inferential sense).

This reading, the infamous <i>Comma Johanneum</i>, has been known in the English-speaking world through the King James translation. However, the evidence--both external and internal--is decidedly against its authenticity. For a detailed discussion, see B. M. Metzger, <i>Textual Commentary</i>, 647-49. Our discussion will briefly address the external evidence. This longer reading is found only in eight late MSS, four of which have the words in a marginal note. Most of these MSS (2318, 221, and [with minor variations] 61, 88, 429, 629, 636, and 918) originate from the 16th century; the earliest MS, codex 221 (10th century) includes the reading in a marginal note, added sometime after the original composition. Thus, there is no sure evidence of this reading in any Greek MS until the 1500's; each such reading was apparently composed after Erasmus' Greek NT was published in 1517. Indeed, the reading appears in no Greek witness of any kind (either MS, patristic, or Greek translation of some other version) until A.D. 1215 (in a Greek translation of the Acts of the Lateran Council, a work originally written in Latin). This is all the more significant, since many a Greek Father would have loved such a reading, for it so succinctly affirms the doctrine of the Trinity. The reading seems to have arisen in a 4th century Latin homily in which the text was allegorized to refer to members of the Trinity. From there, it made its way into copies of the Latin Vulgate, the text used by the Roman Catholic Church. The Trinitarian formula (known as the <i>Comma Johanneum</i>) made its way into the third edition of Erasmus' Greek NT because of pressure from the Catholic Church. After his first edition appeared, there arose such a furor over the absence of the <i>Comma</i> that Erasmus needed to defend himself. He argued that he did not put in the <i>Comma</i> because he found no Greek MSS that included it. Once one was produced (codex 61, written in c. 1520), Erasmus apparently felt obliged to include the reading. He became aware of this MS sometime between May of 1520 and September of 1521. In his annotations to his third edition he does not protest the rendering now in his text, as though it were made to order; but he does defend himself from the charge of indolence, noting that he had taken care to find whatever MSS he could for the production of his text. In the final analysis, Erasmus probably altered the text because of politico-theologico-economic concerns: he did not want his reputation ruined, nor his <i>Novum Instrumentum </i>to go unsold. Modern advocates of the <i>Textus Receptus</i> and KJV generally argue for the inclusion of the <i>Comma Johanneum</i> on the basis of heretical motivation by scribes who did not include it. But these same scribes elsewhere include thoroughly orthodox readings--even in places where the TR/Byzantine MSS lack them. Further, these advocates argue theologically from the position of divine preservation: since this verse is in the TR, it must be original. (Of course, this approach is circular, presupposing as it does that the TR = the original text.) In reality, the issue is history, not heresy: How can one argue that the <i>Comma Johanneum</i> did not appear until the 16th century in any Greek MSS and yet goes back to the original text? Such a stance does not do justice to the gospel: faith must be rooted in history. Significantly, the German translation of Luther was based on Erasmus' second edition (1519) and lacked the <i>Comma.</i> But the KJV translators, basing their work principally on Theodore Beza's 10th edition of the Greek NT (1598), a work which itself was fundamentally based on Erasmus' third and later editions (and Stephanus' editions), popularized the <i>Comma</i> for the English-speaking world. Thus, the <i>Comma Johanneum</i> has been a battleground for English-speaking Christians more than for others.<br>
 <a name="fn250" href="1jo.htm#fnB250"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:9)  This <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joti</FONT>) almost certainly introduces a causal clause, giving the reason why the "testimony of God" is greater than the "testimony of men": "because this is God's testimony that he has testified concerning his Son."<br>
 <a name="fn251" href="1jo.htm#fnB251"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:9)  The problem with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">au{th</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">jJauth</FONT>) in 5:9 lies in determining whether it refers (1) to what precedes or (2) to what follows. A few interpreters would see this as referring to the preceding verses (5:7-8), but the analogy with the author's other uses of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">au{th</FONT> (1:5; 3:11, 23) suggests a reference to what follows. In all of the other instances of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">au{th ejstin</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">{auth estin</FONT>, 1:5; 3:11, 23) the phrase is followed by an epexegetical (explanatory) clause giving the referent (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joti</FONT>] in 1:5, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{na</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jina</FONT>] in 3:11 and 23). The <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause which follows the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">au{th</FONT> in 5:9 does <i>not</i> explain the testimony, but should be understood as an adjectival relative clause which qualifies the testimony further. The <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause which explains the testimony of 5:9 (to which the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">au{th</FONT> in 5:9 refers) is found in 5:11, where the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">au{th ejstin</FONT> is repeated. Thus the second use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">au{th ejstin</FONT> in 5:11 is <i>resumptive</i>, and the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause which follows the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">au{th</FONT> in 5:11 is the epexegetical (explanatory) clause which explains both it and the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">au{th</FONT> in 5:9 which it resumes.<br>
 <a name="fn252" href="1jo.htm#fnB252"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:9)  The second <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joti</FONT>) in 5:9 may be understood in three different ways. (1) It may be causal, in which case it gives the <i>reason</i> why the testimony just mentioned is God's testimony: "because he has testified concerning his Son." This is extremely awkward because of the preceding <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause which is almost certainly causal (although the second <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> could perhaps be resumptive in force, continuing the first). (2) The second <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> could be understood as epexegetical (explanatory), in which case it explains <i>what</i> the testimony of God mentioned in the preceding clause consists of: "because this is the testimony of God, [namely,] that he has testified concerning his Son." This is much smoother grammatically, but encounters the logical problem that "the testimony of God" is defined in 5:11 ("And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life") and the two definitions of what the testimony of God consists of are not identical (some would say that they are not even close). Thus (3) the smoothest way to understand the second <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> logically is to read it as a relative pronoun: "because this is the testimony of God <i>that</i> he has testified concerning his Son." In this case it is exactly parallel to the relative clause which occurs in 5:10b: "because he has not believed the testimony <i>that</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">h}n</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jhn</FONT>) God has testified concerning his Son." (There is in fact a textual problem with the second <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> in 5:9: the Byzantine tradition, along with MS P, reads a relative pronoun [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">h}n</FONT>] in place of the second <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> in 5:9 identical to the relative pronoun in 5:10b. This represents an obvious effort on the part of scribes to smooth out the reading of the text.) In an effort to derive a similar sense from the second <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> in 5:9 it has been suggested that the conjunction <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> should be read as an indefinite relative pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> (sometimes written <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ ti</FONT>). The problem with this suggestion is the use of the neuter relative pronoun to refer to a feminine antecedent (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJ marturiva</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jh marturia</FONT>). It is not without precedent for a neuter relative pronoun to refer to an antecedent of differing gender, especially as some forms tended to become fixed in usage and were used without regard to agreement. But in this particular context it is difficult to see why the author would use a neuter indefinite relative pronoun here in 5:9b and then use the normal feminine relative pronoun (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">h}n</FONT>) in the next verse. (Perhaps this strains at the limits of even the notorious Johannine preference for stylistic variation, although it is impossible to say what the author might or might not have been capable of doing.) Because of the simplicity and logical smoothness which results from reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> as equivalent to a relative pronoun, the third option is preferred, although it is not without its difficulties (as are all three options).<br>

It is not the reality of eternal life (whether it exists at all or not) that is being debated here, but rather which side in the debate (the author and his readers or the opponents) possesses it (this is a key point). The letter began with a testimony that "the eternal life" has been revealed (1:2), and it is consummated here with the reception or acknowledgment of that eternal life as the final testimony. This testimony (which is God's testimony) consists in eternal life itself, which the author and the readers possess, but the opponents do not.

From the parallel statement in 5:10a it is clear that believing in the Son and thus having God's testimony in one's self is the same as "having" the Son here in 5:12a. This is essentially identical to John 3:16: "that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." In contrast, the negative statement in 5:12b reflects the author's evaluation of the opponents: "the one who does not have the Son does not have (eternal) life."

Even at this, some would limit the referent of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tau'ta</FONT> (1) only to 5:1-12 or even 5:12, but more likely <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tau'ta</FONT> in 5:13 refers (2) to the <i>entirety</i> of the letter, for two reasons: (a) based on the structural analogy with the Gospel of John, where the conclusion refers to all that has preceded, it is probable that the conclusion to 1 John refers likewise to all that has preceded; and (b) the statement <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tau'ta e[graya uJmi'n</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">tauta egraya Jumin</FONT>) in 5:13 forms an <i>inclusion</i> with the statement <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiV tau'ta gravfomen hJmei'"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai tauta grafomen Jhmei"</FONT>) at the end of the prologue (1:4) and encompasses the entire body of the letter.<br>

As in the previous instance (5:11) the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joti</FONT>) clause which follows is epexegetical (explanatory) to the pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">au{th</FONT> and explains what the "confidence" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">parrhsiva</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">parrhsia</FONT>) consists of (technically the subject is <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJ parrhsiva</FONT>, the predicate nominative is the pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">au{th</FONT>, and the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause explains the predicate nominative): "And the confidence which we have before him is <i>this</i>, namely, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us."<br>
 <a name="fn265" href="1jo.htm#fnB265"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:14)  A third-class condition is introduced by <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejavn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ean</FONT>) + present subjunctive. Because the apodosis also contains a present tense verb (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajkouvei</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">akouei</FONT>) this belongs in a subcategory of third-class conditional sentences known as present general. In the Koine period <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejavn</FONT> can mean "when" or "whenever" and is virtually the equivalent of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{tan</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jotan</FONT>; see BAGD 211 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejavn </FONT>I.1.d). Thus the meaning here is, "whenever (i.e., if) we ask anything according to his will, then he hears us."<br>
 <a name="fn266" href="1jo.htm#fnB266"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:15)  This use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejavn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ean</FONT>) with the indicative mood rather than the subjunctive constitutes an anomalous usage. Here <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejavn</FONT> is used instead of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eji</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ei</FONT>) to introduce a first-class condition: "if we know (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oi[damen</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">oidamen</FONT>) that he hears us in regard to whatever we ask, then we know that we have the requests which we have asked from him." The reality of the condition (protasis) is assumed for the sake of argument; given the protasis, the apodosis follows. The use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejavn</FONT> for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eji</FONT> is rare but not without precedent; see M. Zerwick (<i>Biblical Greek</i> &#167;&#167;330-31).<br>

As BDF &#167;371.4 points out, such a condition describes what is to be expected under certain circumstances. If a person sees his Christian brother committing a sin not to death, it is expected that he will make intercession for the sinning brother ("he should ask..."), and that life will be granted to the sinner in answer to the request. The author has already pointed out in 5:14-15 that if believers make requests of God in accordance with his will they may have confidence that they will receive the requests they have asked for, and this is a specific instance.<br>

 <a name="fn271" href="1jo.htm#fnB271"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:16)  The referent of the (understood) third person subject of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dwvsei</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">dwsei</FONT>) in 5:16 is difficult to determine. Once again the author's meaning is obscure. Several possibilities have been suggested for the referent of the subject of this verb: (1) From a grammatical and syntactical standpoint, it would be easiest to understand the subject of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dwvsei</FONT> in 5:16 as the person who makes the request, since this person is the subject of the preceding verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aijthvsei</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">aithsei</FONT>) and the following verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejrwthvsh/</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">erwthsh</FONT>). From a theological standpoint this is extremely difficult, however, since it would make the person who prays for the sinner the giver of life, and it is questionable whether the author (for whom God is the ultimate source of life) would say that one believer could `give' life to another. In this case the meaning would be: "he [the petitioner] should ask, and he [the petitioner] will grant life to him [the sinner], namely, to those who sin not to death." (2) Another option is to see God as the subject of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dwvsei</FONT> in 5:16 and the Giver of life to the sinner. This is far more consistent theologically with the author's perspective on God as the Giver of life everywhere else, but it is awkward grammatically (as explained in reference to the previous position above) because it involves a shift in subjects for the three third-person verbs in the context from the person who makes the request (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aijthvsei</FONT>) to God (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dwvsei</FONT>) and back to the person who makes the request (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejrwthvsh/</FONT>). In this case the meaning would be: "he [the petitioner] should ask, and he [God] will grant life to him [the sinner], namely, to those who sin not to death." (3) A third possibility is to see God as the subject of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dwvsei</FONT> in 5:16, but the person who makes the request (rather than the sinner) as the referent of the indirect object <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aujtw'/</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">autw</FONT>) in 5:16. This is possible because the indirect object <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aujtw'/</FONT> is singular, while the dative substantival participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">toi'" aJmartavnousin</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">toi" Jamartanousin</FONT>) which follows (which clearly refers to those who sin) is plural. Thus the meaning would be: "he [the petitioner] should ask, and he [God] will grant life to him [the petitioner], with reference to [his praying for] those who sin not to death." Although this is a difficult and awkward construction no matter what solution one takes, on the whole the second alternative seems most probable. Even if option (1) is preferred it must be acknowledged that God is ultimately the source of life, although it is given as a result of the petitioner's intercessory prayer and the petitioner becomes, in a sense, the intermediate agent. But in the preceding context (5:11) the author has emphasized that God is the Giver of life, and in spite of the awkwardness in the change of subjects, that would seem to be the most likely meaning here, so option (2) is preferred. Option (3) is improbable because it seems clear that it should be the sinner for whom intercession is made, rather than the petitioner, who is the recipient of life. The petitioner would be assumed to possess life already or he could not be making a request which God would hear. In this case the change from the singular dative indirect object (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aujtw'/</FONT>) to the plural dative substantival participle (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">toi'" aJmartavnousin</FONT>) is merely a loose construction (which by this time should come as no surprise from the author).<br>

 <a name="fn274" href="1jo.htm#fnB274"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:17)  The meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajdikiva</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">adikia</FONT>) here is "unrighteousness" (BAGD 18 s.v. 2). It refers to the opposite of that which is <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">divkaio"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">dikaios</FONT>, "right, just, righteous") which is used by the author to describe both God and Jesus Christ (1 John 1:9; 2:2, 29). Here, having implied that sins committed by believers (sins "not to death") may be prayed for and forgiven, the author does not want to leave the impression that such sin is insignificant, because this could be viewed as a concession to the views of the opponents (who as moral indifferentists have downplayed the significance of sin in the Christian's life).<br>

 <a name="fn276" href="1jo.htm#fnB276"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:18)  The concept represented by the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">gennavw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">gennaw</FONT>) here means to be fathered by God and thus a child of God. The imagery in 1 John is that of the male parent who fathers children (see 2:29).<br>
 <a name="fn277" href="1jo.htm#fnB277"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:18)  <i>Grk</i> "he"; see the note on the following word "protects."<br>
 <a name="fn278" href="1jo.htm#fnB278"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:18)  The meaning of the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJ gennhqeiV" ejk tou' qeou' threi' aujtovn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jo gennhqeis ek tou qeou threi auton</FONT>) in 5:18 is extraordinarily difficult. Again the author's capacity for making obscure statements results in several possible meanings for this phrase: (1) "The fathering by God protects him [the Christian]." Here a textual variant for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJ gennhqeiv"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJ gevnnhsi"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jh gennhsi"</FONT>) has suggested to some that the passive participle should be understood as a noun ("fathering" or perhaps "birth"), but the MS evidence is extremely slight (1505 1852 2138 2495 and a few of the versions). This almost certainly represents a scribal attempt to clarify an obscure phrase. (2) "The One fathered by God [Jesus] protects him [the Christian]." This is a popular interpretation, and is certainly possible grammatically. Yet the introduction of a reference to Jesus in this context is sudden; to be unambiguous the author could have mentioned the "Son of God" here, or used the pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejkei'no"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ekeinos</FONT>) as a reference to Jesus as he consistently does elsewhere in 1 John. This interpretation, while possible, seems in context highly unlikely. (3) "The one fathered by God [the Christian] protects himself." Again a textual problem is behind this alternative, since a number of MSS (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> K P <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Y</FONT> 33 88 181 1739 <i>Byz</i> <i>al</i>) supply the reflexive pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eJautovn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jeauton</FONT>) in place of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aujtovn</FONT> in 5:18. On the basis of the external evidence this has a good possibility of being the original reading, but internal evidence favors <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aujtovn</FONT> as the more difficult reading, since <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eJautovn</FONT> may be explained as a scribal attempt at grammatical smoothness. From a logical standpoint, however, it is difficult to make much more sense out of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eJautovn</FONT>; to say what "the Christian protects himself" means in the context is far from clear. (4) "The one fathered by God [the Christian] holds on to him [God]." This results in further awkwardness, because the third person pronoun (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aujtou'</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">autou</FONT>) in the following clause must refer to the Christian, not God. Furthermore, although <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">threvw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">threw</FONT>) can mean "hold on to" (BAGD 815 s.v. 3), this is not a common meaning for the verb in Johannine usage, occurring elsewhere only in Rev 3:3. (5) "The one fathered by God [the Christian], he [God] protects him [the Christian]." This involves a <i>pendant nominative</i> construction (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJ gennhqeiV" ejk tou' qeou'</FONT>) where a description of something within the clause is placed in the nominative case and moved forward ahead of the clause for emphatic reasons. This may be influenced by Semitic style; such a construction is also present in John 17:2 (in order that <i>everyone</i> whom You have given to him, he may give <i>to them</i> eternal life"). This view is defended by K. Beyer (<i>Semitische Syntax im Neuen Testament</i>, 1:216ff.) and appears to be the most probable in terms both of syntax and of sense. It makes God the protector of the Christian (rather than the Christian himself), which fits the context much better, and there is precedent in Johannine literature for such syntactical structure.<br>
 <a name="fn279" href="1jo.htm#fnB279"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:19)  The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejk</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ek</FONT>) here indicates both source and possession: Christians are "from" God in the sense that they are begotten by him, and they belong to him. For a similar use of the preposition compare the phrases <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejk tou' patrov"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ek tou patro"</FONT>) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejk tou' kovsmou</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ek tou kosmou</FONT>) in 1 John 2:16.<br>
 <a name="fn280" href="1jo.htm#fnB280"><sup>58</sup></a><b>tc</b> (5:20)  After <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{na</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jina</FONT>), a subjunctive is required by the rules of syntax. In a few places in the NT (principally in the Johannine corpus, especially Revelation), however, an indicative verb is found. Found as it is in the Alexandrian MSS, whose scribes were purportedly sensitive to literary Koine syntax, the indicative reading has all the earmarks of being original. In virtually every instance, the <i>Byzantine</i> MSS change such an indicative to the subjunctive (here, the change is from <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ginwvskomen</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ginwskomen</FONT>] to <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ginwvskwmen</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ginwskwmen</FONT>]). The indicative is thus a harder reading and unmotivated in the witnesses in which it is found. It best explains the rise of the other reading. In this text, the external evidence for the indicative is overwhelming and ought to be followed: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> A B* L P 049 33 81 614 <i>et alii</i>.<br>
 <b>tn</b> (5:20)  The <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{na</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jina</FONT>) introduces a purpose clause which gives the purpose of the preceding affirmation: "we know that the Son of God has come and has given us insight (so that we may) know him who is true." <br>
 <a name="fn281" href="1jo.htm#fnB281"><sup>59</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:20)  The pronoun <i>This one</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ou|to"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joutos</FONT>) refers to a person, but it is far from clear whether it should be understood as a reference (1) to God the Father or (2) to Jesus Christ. R. E. Brown (<i>Epistles of John </i>[AB], 625) comments, "I John, which began with an example of stunning grammatical obscurity in the prologue, continues to the end to offer us examples of unclear grammar." The nearest previous antecedent is <i>Jesus Christ</i>, immediately preceding, but on some occasions when this has been true the pronoun still refers to God (see 1 John 2:3). The first predicate which follows <i>This one</i> in 5:20, <i>the true God</i>, is a description of God the Father used by Jesus in John 17:3, and was used in the preceding clause of the present verse to refer to God the Father (<i>him who is true</i>). Yet the second predicate of <i>This one</i> in 5:20, <i>eternal life</i>, appears to refer to Jesus, because although the Father possesses "life" (John 5:26, 6:57) just as Jesus does (John 1:4, 6:57, 1 John 5:11), "life" is <i>never</i> predicated of the Father elsewhere, while it is predicated of Jesus in John 11:25 and 14:6 (a self-predication by Jesus). If <i>This one</i> in 5:20 is understood as referring to Jesus, it forms an inclusion with the prologue, which introduced the reader to "the eternal <i>life</i> which was with the Father and was manifested to us." Thus it appears best to understand the pronoun <i>This one</i> in 5:20 as a reference to Jesus Christ. The christological affirmation which results is striking, but certainly not beyond the capabilities of the author (see John 1:1 and 20:28): <i>This One [Jesus Christ] is the true God and eternal life</i>.<br>
 <a name="fn282" href="1jo.htm#fnB282"><sup>60</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:21)  The modern reader may wonder what all this has to do with idolatry. In the author's mind, to follow the secessionist opponents with their false Christology would amount to idolatry, since it would involve worshiping a false god instead of the true God, Jesus Christ. Thus <i>guard yourselves from idols</i> means for the readers to guard themselves against the opponents and their teaching.
