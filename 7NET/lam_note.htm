 <a name="fn1" href="lam.htm#fnB1"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:1)  The LXX and Vulgate (dependent on the LXX) include a preface that is lacking in the MT: "And it came to pass after Israel had been taken captive and Jerusalem had been laid waste, Jeremiah sat weeping and lamented this lament over Jerusalem, and said...." Scholars generally view the preface in the LXX and Vulgate as a later addition.<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="lam.htm#fnB2"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:1) The adverb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkya</FONT> is used as an exclamation of lament or desperation: "How!" (BDB 32.2) or "Alas!" (<i>HALOT</i> 1:40.1e). It is often the first word in laments (Isa 1:21; Jer 48:17; Lam 1:1; 2:1; 4:1, 2). Like the less emphatic exclamation <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Eya</FONT> ("Alas!") (2 Sam 1:19; Isa 14:4, 12; Ezek 26:17), it is used in contexts of lament and mourning.<br>
 <b>sn </b> (1:1) The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ekya</FONT> ("Alas!") and its counterpart <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Eya</FONT> ("Alas!") are normally uttered in contexts of mourning as exclamations of lament over a deceased person (2 Sam 1:19; Isa 14:4, 12). The prophets borrow this term from its normal <i>Sitz im Leben</i> in the funeral lament and rhetorically place it in the context of announcements or descriptions of God's judgment (Isa 1:21; Jer 48:17; Ezek 26:17; Lam 1:1; 2:1; 4:1, 2). This creates a personification of the city/nation which is either in danger of imminent "death" or already has "died" as a result of the LORD's judgment.<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="lam.htm#fnB3"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Heb</i> "great of people." The genitive-construct <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;u ytBr</FONT> ("great of people") is an idiom for large population: "full of people, populous" (BDB 913; <i>HALOT</i> 3:1172.7a). The <i>hireq-campaginis</i> ending on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ytBr</FONT> (from the adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">br</FONT> "great") is a remnant of the old genitive-construct case (GKC &#167;90.<i>l</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn4" href="lam.htm#fnB4"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ddB</FONT> ("isolation, alone") functions as adverbial accusation of state. After verbs of dwelling, it pictures someone sitting in isolation (Lev 13:46; Deut 32:12; Jer 15:17; Lam 1:1; 3:28) (BDB 94.1; <i>HALOT</i> 1:109-10).<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="lam.htm#fnB5"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Heb</i> "great." The adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">br</FONT> ("great") is used in reference to a position of prominence, leadership (Ps 48:3; Dan 11:3, 5) or strength (Isa 53:12; 63:1; 2 Chr 14:10) (BDB 913.2.b; <i>HALOT</i> 3:1172.6). The <i>hireq-campaginis</i> ending on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ytBr</FONT> (from the adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">br</FONT> "great") is a remnant of the old genitive-construct case (GKC &#167;90.<i>l</i>).<br>

 <a name="fn7" href="lam.htm#fnB7"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ytrc</FONT> ("princess") is in construct with the following noun.

  <b>sn</b> (1:1)  Judah was organized into administrative districts or provinces under the rule of provincial governor (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrv</FONT>) (1 Kgs 20:14, 17, 19) (BDB 193.2; <i>HALOT</i> 2:549). The feminine term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrc</FONT> ("princess, provincial governess") is a wordplay alluding to this political background: personified Jerusalem had ruled over the Judean provinces.<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="lam.htm#fnB8"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Heb</i> "princess among the provinces." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnydm</FONT> is an Aramaic loanword which refers to an administrative district or province in the empire (e.g., Ezek 19:8; Dan 8:2) (BDB 193.2; <i>HALOT</i> 2:549).<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="lam.htm#fnB9"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:1) Following the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hyh</FONT> ("to be"), the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l</FONT> designates a transition into a new state or condition: "to become" (BDB 512.4.a) (e.g., Gen 2:7; 1 Sam 9:16; 15:1).<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="lam.htm#fnB10"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">sm</FONT> means "forced labor, corve&eacute; slave, conscripted worker" (<i>HALOT</i> 2:604.2; BDB 586-87.2b). It refers to a subjugated population, subject to forced labor and/or heavy taxes (Gen 49:15; Exod 1:11; Deut 20:11; Josh 16:10; 17:13; Judg 1:28, 30, 33, 35; 1 Kgs 5:28; 9:15, 21; 12:18; 2 Chr 10:18; Isa 31:8; Lam 1:1).<br>

 <a name="fn12" href="lam.htm#fnB12"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:2) <i>Heb</i> "lovers." The term "lovers" is a figurative expression (hypocatastasis), comparing Jerusalem's false gods and foreign political alliances to sexually immoral lovers. Hosea uses similar imagery (Hos 2:5, 7, 10, 13).<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="lam.htm#fnB13"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3) <i> Heb</i> "Judah." The term "Judah" is a synecdoche of nation (= Judah) for the inhabitants of the nation (= people).<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="lam.htm#fnB14"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:3) There is a debate over the function of the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m</FONT>: (1) temporal sense: "after" (<i>HALOT</i> 2:598.2c; BDB 581.4.b) (e.g., Gen 4:3; 38:24; Josh 23:1; Judg 11:4; 14:8; Isa 24:22; Ezek 38:8; Hos 6:2) is adopted by one translation: "After affliction and harsh labor, Judah has gone into exile" (NIV). (2) causal sense: "because" (<i>HALOT</i> 2:598.6; BDB 579.f) (e.g., Isa 5:13) is adopted by many translations: "Judah has gone into exile because of misery and harsh oppression/servitude" (KJV, NKJV, RSV, NRSV, NJPS). (3) instrumentality: "by, through" (BDB 579.e): "Judah has gone into exile under affliction, and under harsh servitude" (NASB). The issue here is whether this verse states that Judah went into exile <i>after</i> suffering a long period of trouble and toil, or that Judah went into exile <i>because of</i> the misery and affliction that the populace suffered under the hands of the Babylonians. For fuller treatment of this difficult syntactical problem, see D. R. Hillers, <i>Lamentations</i>, AB 7A (Garden City, NY: Doubleday and Sons, 1979), 6-7.<br>
 <a name="fn15" href="lam.htm#fnB15"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  See preceding translation note on the word "under."<br>
 <a name="fn16" href="lam.htm#fnB16"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  <i>Heb</i> "great servitude." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hdbu</FONT> ("servitude") refers to the enforced labor and suffering inflicted upon conquered peoples who are subjugated into slavery (BDB 715.3; <i>HALOT</i> 2:776.1b) (Exod 1:14; 2:23; 5:9, 11; 6:9; Deut 26:6; 1 Kgs 12:4; 1 Chr 26:30; 2 Chr 10:4; 12:8; Isa 14:3; Lam 1:3).<br>
 <a name="fn17" href="lam.htm#fnB17"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3) <i> Heb</i> "she." The antecedent of "she" is "Judah," which functions as a synecdoche of nation (= Judah) for the inhabitants of the nation (= people). Thus, "she" (= Judah) is tantamount to "they" (= former inhabitants of Judah).<br>
 <a name="fn18" href="lam.htm#fnB18"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3) <i> Heb</i> "her" (twice in this line). See the note on the word "they" earlier in this verse.<br>
 <a name="fn19" href="lam.htm#fnB19"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/yB</FONT> is used in reference to a location: "between" (BDB 107.1). Hillers nuances this, "have cornered her in narrow straits." The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrxmh /yB</FONT> ("between the narrow places") is unparalleled elsewhere in the Hebrew scriptures; however, this line is paraphrased in "The Thanksgiving Psalm" from Qumran (Hodayoth = 1QH v 29) which adds the phrase "so I could not get away." Following the interpretation of this line at Qumran, it describes a futile attempt to flee from the enemies in narrow straits which thwarted a successful escape.<br>
 <a name="fn20" href="lam.htm#fnB20"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  <i>Heb</i> "distresses." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rxm</FONT> ("distress") occurs only here and in Ps 118:5 (NIV, "anguish") (<i>HALOT</i> 2:624). Here, the plural form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrxm</FONT> (lit., "distresses") is an example of the plural of intensity: "intense distress." The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrxmh /yB</FONT> ("between the narrow places") is unparalleled elsewhere in the Hebrew scriptures; however, this line is paraphrased in "The Thanksgiving Psalm" from Qumran (Hodayoth = 1QH v 29) which adds the phrase "so I could not get away." Following the interpretation of this line at Qumran, it describes a futile attempt to flee from the enemies in narrow straits which thwarted a successful escape. Hillers nuances this line, "have cornered her in narrow straits."<br>
 <a name="fn21" href="lam.htm#fnB21"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:4) <i>Heb</i> "roads of Zion." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/oYx</FONT> is a genitive of direction (termination) following the construct noun, meaning "roads to Zion."<br>
  <b>sn </b> (1:4) The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ykrd</FONT> ("roads") is normally masculine in gender, but here it is feminine (e.g., Exod 18:20) (BDB 202) as indicated by the following feminine adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tolba</FONT> ("mourns"). This rare feminine usage is probably due to the personification of Jerusalem as a bereaved woman throughout chap. 1.<br>
 <a name="fn22" href="lam.htm#fnB22"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  The adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tolba</FONT> ("mourning") functions as a predicate of state.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:4)  The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lba</FONT> ("mourning") refers to the mourning rites for the dead or to those mourning the deceased (Gen 37:35; Job 29:25; Ps 35:14; Jer 16:7; Est 6:12; Sir 7:34; 48:24). The prophets often use it figuratively to personify Jerusalem as a mourner, lamenting her deceased and exiled citizens (Isa 57:18; 61:2, 3) (BDB 5; <i>HALOT</i> 1:7).<br>
 <a name="fn23" href="lam.htm#fnB23"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:4) <i>Heb</i> "from lack of." The construction <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ylBm</FONT> is composed of the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m</FONT> functioning in a causal sense (BDB 580.2f) and the adverb of negation <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ylB</FONT> to denote the negative cause: "from want of" or "without" (<i>HALOT</i> 1:133.4; BDB 117.c) (Num 14:16; Deut 9:28; 28:55; Eccl 3:11; Isa 5:13; Jer 2:15; 9:11; Hos 4:6; Ezek 34:5).<br>

 <a name="fn26" href="lam.htm#fnB26"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  Heb "those coming of feast." The construct chain <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">duom yaB</FONT> consists of (1) the substantival plural construct participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yaB</FONT> ("those who come") and (2) the collective singular genitive of purpose <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">duom</FONT> ("for the feasts").<br>
 <a name="fn27" href="lam.htm#fnB27"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:4)  The MT reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hyruv</FONT> ("her gates"). The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest revocalizing the text to the participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hyruv</FONT> ("her gate-keepers") from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ruv</FONT> ("porter") (BDB 1045). The revocalization creates tight parallelism: "her gate-keepers"//"her priests," but ruins the chiasm: (A) her gate-keepers, (B) her priests, (B') her virgins, (A') the city itself.<br>
 <a name="fn28" href="lam.htm#fnB28"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;mv</FONT> normally means "to be desolated; to be appalled," but when used in reference to land, it means "deserted" (Isa 49:8; Ezek 33:28; 35:12, 15; 36:4) (BDB 1030.1).<br>
 <a name="fn29" href="lam.htm#fnB29"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  <i>Heb</i> "groan" or "sigh." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jna</FONT> is an expression of grief (Prov 29:2; Isa 24:7; Lam 1:4, 8; Ezek 9:4; 21:11) (BDB 58.1; <i>HALOT</i> 1:70-71). BDB suggests that it means "sigh" but <i>HALOT</i> prefers "groan" here.<br>
 <a name="fn30" href="lam.htm#fnB30"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:4)  The MT reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">togWn</FONT> "are grieved" (Niphal participle fpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hgy</FONT> "to grieve"). The LXX <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">agoumenai</FONT> reflects <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">togWhn</FONT> "are led away" (Qal passive participle fpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ghn</FONT> "to lead away into exile"), also reflected in Aquilla and Symmachus. The MT reading is an unusual form (see translator's note below) and best explains the origin of the LXX which is a more common root. It would be difficult to explain the origin of the MT reading if the LXX reflects the original. Therefore, the MT is probably the original reading.<br>
 <b> tn</b> (1:4)  <i>Heb</i> "are grieved" (BDB 387) or "are worried" (<i>HALOT</i> 2:385). The unusual form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">togWn</FONT> is probably best explained as Niphal fpl participle (with dissimilated <i>nun</i>) from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hgy</FONT> (see H. Bauer and P. Leander<i>, Historische Grammatik der hebraischen Sprache</i>, 443k; G. Bergstrasser, <i>Hebraische Grammatik</i>, 2:128.g). The similarly formed Niphal participle mpl construct <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ygWn</FONT> appears in Zeph 3:18 (GKC &#167;130.1). The Niphal of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hgy</FONT> appears only twice, both in contexts of sorrow: "to grieve, sorrow" (Lam 1:4; Zeph 3:18) (BDB 387; <i>HALOT</i> 2:385).<br>

 <a name="fn36" href="lam.htm#fnB36"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Heb</i> "because of her many rebellions." The plural <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hyuvP</FONT> ("her rebellions") is an example of the plural of repeated action or characteristic behavior (see Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax</i>, 7.4.2c). The 3fs suffix ("her") probably functions as a subjective genitive: "her rebellions" = "she has rebelled."<br>
 <a name="fn37" href="lam.htm#fnB37"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Heb</i> "went away" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wklh</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn38" href="lam.htm#fnB38"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  The singular noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ybv</FONT> is a collective singular, meaning "captives, prisoners" (BDB 985). It functions as an adverbial accusative of state: "(they were taken away) as captives."<br>
 <a name="fn39" href="lam.htm#fnB39"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6) <i> Heb</i> "all her splendor." The 3fs pronominal suffix ("her") functions as a subjective genitive: "everything in which she gloried." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rdh</FONT> ("splendor") is used of personal and impersonal referents in whom Israel gloried: Ephraim (Deut 33:17), Jerusalem (Isa 5:14), Carmel (Isa 35:2) (BDB 214.2). The context focuses on the exile of Zion's children (1:5c) and leaders (1:6bc). The departure of the children and leaders of Jerusalem going away into exile suggested to the writer the departure of the glory of Israel.<br>

It is used figuratively (hypocatastasis) of military enemies who "hunt down" those who flee for their lives (e.g., Gen 14:15; Lev 26:7, 36; Judg 4:22; Ps 7:6; 69:27; 83:16; 143:3; Isa 17:13; Lam 5:5; Amos 1:11) (<i>HALOT</i> 3:1191.2b; BDB 922.1).<br>

 <a name="fn47" href="lam.htm#fnB47"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  <i>Heb</i> "the days of her poverty and her homelessness." The plural construct <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ymy</FONT> ("days of") functions in the general sense "the time of" or "when," representing a time period vividly as that of a single day (e.g., Deut 16:3; Hos 2:17) (BDB 400.7d; <i>HALOT</i> 2:400.6a).<br>

The plural noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hydWrmW</FONT> (lit. "her homelessnesses") is an example of the plural of intensity. The two nouns <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hydWrmW Hynu</FONT> (lit., "her poverty and her homelessness") form a nominal hendiadys in which one noun functions adjectivally and the other retains its full nominal sense: "her impoverished homelessness" or "homeless poor" (GKC &#167;124.<i>e</i>). The nearly identical phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ydWrm &lt;yYnu</FONT> ("homeless poor") is used in Isa 58:7 (see GKC &#167;83.<i>c</i>), suggesting this was a Hebrew idiom.

The MT is favored on the basis of internal evidence: (1) The MT is the more difficult reading, being a <i>hapax legomena</i>, (2) the LXX is guilty of simply misunderstanding the root and wrongly vocalizing the consonantal text, and (3) the LXX does not make good sense contextually, while the MT does.<br>

This reflects the ancient Near Eastern custom of shaking the head in scorn (e.g., Jer 18:16; Ps 44:15 [HT 14]), hence the translation "object of scorn." There is debate whether <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hdyn</FONT> means (1) "object of head-shaking" from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dWd</FONT> "to shake" (BDB 627); (2) "unclean thing" from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hdn</FONT> "to be impure" (BDB 622b); or (3) "wanderer" from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ddn</FONT> "to wander" (BDB 622a). The LXX and Rashi connected it to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ddn</FONT> "to wander"; however, several important early Greek recensions (Aquilla and Symmachus) and Syriac translated it as "unclean thing."

The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ha*m=f%</FONT> "uncleanness" refers in general to the state of ritual uncleanness (<i>HALOT</i> 2:376) and specifically to (1) sexual uncleanness (Num 5:19); (2) filthy mass (Ezek 24:11; 2 Chr 29:16); (3) ritual uncleanness (Lev 16:16, 19; Ezek 22:15; 24:13; 36:25, 29; 39:24; Zech 13:2); (4) menstrual uncleanness (Lev 15:25, 26, 30; 18:19; Ezek 36:17); (5) polluted meat (Judg 13:7, 14) (BDB 380). Here, Jerusalem is personified as a woman whose menstrual uncleanness has soiled even her own clothes; this is a picture of the consequences of the sin of Jerusalem: uncleanness = her sin, and soiling her own clothes = consequences of sin.<br>

External evidence favors the MT (supported by all other versions and medieval Hebrew MSS); none of the other versions preserve/reflect a passive form. Symmachus is known to have departed from a wooden literal translation (characteristic of Aquilla) in favor of smooth and elegant Greek style. The second edition of the Latin Vulgate drew on Symmachus; thus, it is not an independent witness to the passive reading, but merely a secondary witness reflected Symmachus. The MT is undoubtedly the original reading. <br>

The plural <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yalP</FONT> (lit., "astonishments") is an example of the plural of intensity: "very astonishing." The noun functions as an adverbial accusative of manner. Rendering <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yalP</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">drTw</FONT> as "she has come down marvelously" (cf.

External evidence strongly favors the MT reading. The 3fs textual variant probably arose out of an attempt to harmonize this form with all the other 3fs forms in 1:1-11a.

The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dmjm</FONT> ("desirable thing") refers to valuable possessions, such as gold and silver which people desire (e.g., Ezra 8:27) (BDB 326-27). This probably refers, not to the valuable possessions of Jerusalem in general, but to the sacred objects in the temple in particular, as suggested by the rest of the verse.<br>

 <a name="fn76" href="lam.htm#fnB76"><sup>76</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lhq</FONT> ("assembly") does not refer here to the collective group of people assembled to worship the LORD, but to the place of their assembly: the temple. This is an example of a synecdoche of container (= temple) for the people contained (= assembly). <br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:10)  This is a quotation from Deut 23:3, "No Ammonite or Moabite or any of his descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD, even down to the tenth generation." Jeremiah applies this prohibition against Ammonites and Moabites to the Babylonians who ransacked and destroyed the temple in 587/586 B.C. This hermeneutical move may be explained on the basis of synecdoche of species (= Ammonites and Moabites) for general (= unconverted Gentiles as a whole). On a different note, the prohibition forbidding Ammonites and Moabites from entering the "assembly" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lhq</FONT>) (Deut 23:2-8) did not disallow Gentile proselytes from converting to Yahwism or from living within the community (=assembled body) of Israel. For example, Ruth the Moabitess abandoned the worship of Moabite gods and embraced Yahweh, then was welcomed into the community of Bethlehem in Judah (Ruth 1:15-22) and even incorporated into the lineage leading to King David (Ruth 4:18-22). This Deuteronomic law did not disallow such genuine conversions of repentant faith toward Yahweh, nor their incorporation into the life of the Israelite community. Nor did it discourage Gentiles from offering sacrifices to the LORD (Num 15:15-16). Rather, it prohibited Gentiles from entering into the tabernacle/temple (= place of assembly) of Israel. This is clear from the reaction of the post-exilic community when it realized that Deut 23:3-5 had been violated by Tobiah the Ammonite who had been given living quarters in the temple precincts (Neh 13:1-9). This is also reflected in the days of the Second Temple when Gentile proselytes were allowed to enter the "court of the Gentiles" in Herod's temple, but were forbidden further access into the inner temple precincts.<br>

When used with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vpn</FONT>, the Hiphil <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">byvh</FONT> of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv</FONT> may mean "to preserve a person's life," that is, to keep a person alive (Lam 1:14, 19).<br>

The construction <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;wyb</FONT> ("in the day of") is a common Hebrew idiom, meaning "when" (e.g., Gen 2:4; Lev 7:35; Num 3:1; Deut 4:15; 2 Sam 22:1; Pss 18:1; 138:3; Zech 8:9) (BDB 400.7.d.3.a). This temporal idiom refers to a general time period, but uses the term "day" as a forceful rhetorical device to emphasize the vividness and drama of the event, depicting it as occurring within a single day. In the ancient Near East, warrior-kings often referred to a successful campaign as "the day of X" to portray themselves as powerful conquerors who, as it were, could inaugurate and complete a victory military campaign within the span of one day.<br>

The idiom <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;orMm</FONT> ("from on high") does not focus so much on the place of origin, but on the quality of the referent.

There are two textual deviations: (1) the MT vocalizes the verb as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dq^c=n]</FONT> (Niphal perfect 3ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dqc</FONT> "to bind"), while the alternate tradition vocalizes it as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dq^v=n]</FONT> (Niphal perfect 3ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dqv</FONT> "to keep watch"); and (2) the MT vocalizes <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu)</FONT> as the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu)</FONT> ("yoke"), while the versions and medieval Hebrew MSS vocalize it as the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu^</FONT> ("upon"). External evidence favors the alternate vocalization: all the early versions (LXX, Targum, Vulgate, Peshitta) and many medieval Hebrew MSS versus the relatively late MT vocalization tradition. However, internal evidence favors the MT vocalization: (1) The MT verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dqc</FONT> ("to bind") is a <i>hapax legomena</i> (BDB 974) which might have been easily confused for the more common verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dqv</FONT> ("to keep watch") which is well-attested elsewhere (Job 21:32; Pss 102:8; 127:1; Prov 8:34; Isa 29:20; Jer 1:12; 5:6; 31:28; 44:27; Ezr 8:29; Dan 9:14) (BDB 1052.2). (2) The syntax of the MT is somewhat awkward, which might have influenced a scribe towards the alternate vocalization. (3) The presence of the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wlu</FONT> ("his yoke") in the following line supports the presence of the same term in this line. (4) Thematic continuity of 1:14 favors the MT: throughout the verse, the inhabitants of Jerusalem are continually compared to yoked animals who are sold into the hands of cruel task-masters. The alternate vocalization intrudes into an otherwise unified stanza. In summary, despite strong external evidence in favor of the alternate vocalization tradition, even stronger internal evidence favors the MT.<br>

However, several important recensions of the LXX reflect an alternate vocalization tradition: Lucian <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ton zugon autou</FONT> "his yoke" and Symmachus <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o lugo" autou</FONT> "his yoke" both reflect a <i>Vorlage</i> of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">oLu</FONT> "his yoke" (noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu)</FONT> "yoke" + 3ms suffix). The Lucianic recension was aimed at bringing the LXX into closer conformity to the Hebrew; therefore, this is an important textual witness. Internal evidence favors the readings of Lucian and Symmachus as well: the entire stanza focuses on the repeated theme of the "yoke" of the LORD. The MT reading is obscure in meaning, and the 3cpl form violates the syntactical flow: "[my sins] are lashed together by <i>his</i> hand; <i>they</i> have gone up upon my neck, <i>he</i> has weakened my strength; <i>the </i>LORD has handed me over ..." On the other hand, the Lucian/Symmachus reflects contextual congruence: "My sins are bound around my neck like a <i>yoke</i>, they are <i>lashed together</i> by his hand; <i>his yoke</i> is upon my neck, he has weakened my strength; he has handed me over to those whom I am powerless to resist."<br>

The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wrmrmj yum</FONT> means "my bowels burned" (<i>HALOT</i> 1:330) or "my bowels are in a ferment," as a euphemism for lower-intestinal bowel problems (BDB 330). This phrase also occurs in later rabbinic literature (<i>m. Sanhedrin</i> 7:2).

 <a name="fn126" href="lam.htm#fnB126"><sup>126</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:20)  <i>Heb</i> "because I was very rebellious."

When an infinitive absolute is used with a finite verb of the same root, it affirms the verbal idea (e.g., Gen 2:17; 18:10; 22:17; 31:15; 46:4; Num 16:13; 23:11; Judg 4:9; 15:13; 20:39; 1 Sam 2:30; 9:6; 2 Sam 24:24; Isa 6:9; Ezek 16:4).

The LXX <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">akousate</FONT> reflects the vocalization <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wum=v!</FONT> "Hear!" (Qal imperative 2mpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">umv</FONT> "to hear"). Internal evidence favors the MT. Elsewhere in Lamentations, personified Jerusalem urges God with singular imperatives ("Look! See!"); however, nowhere else is a plural imperative used. In fact, the Qal perfect 3cpl form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wum=v*</FONT> "They hear" appears in the following line. The referent of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wum=v*</FONT> is the enemy who has destroyed Jerusalem and now mocks her when they hear her laments. The MT vocalization is undoubtedly original. Most English translations follow the MT: "They hear" (KJV, NKJV, NASB, NIV, NJPS, CEV); but several follow the LXX and revocalize the text as an imperative: "Hear!" (RSV, NRSV, TEV).<br>

 <a name="fn132" href="lam.htm#fnB132"><sup>132</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:21)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tabh</FONT> (Hiphil perfect 2ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">awb</FONT> "to bring") probably functions, not as a simple past-time perfect, but as a precative perfect, an unusual volitional nuance similar to the imperative of request. The precative is used in reference to situations the speaker prays for and expects to be realized; it is a prayer or request of confidence (e.g., 2 Sam 7:29; Job 21:16; 22:18; Pss 3:8; 4:2; 7:7; 22:22; 31:5-6; 71:3; Lam 1:21). See Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Biblical Hebrew Syntax</i>, 30.5.4.c-d. This volitional precative nuance is reflected in the Syriac Peshitta which translates this verb using an imperative. Most English translations adopt the precative nuance: "Bring thou the day thou hast announced" (RSV, NRSV), "Oh, that Thou wouldst bring the day which Thou hast proclaimed" (NASB), "May you bring the day you have announced" (NIV), "Bring the day you promised" (TEV), "Oh, bring on them what befell me!" (NJPS), "Hurry and punish them as you have punished me" (CEV). A few translations adopt a prophetic perfect future-time nuance: "thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called" (KJV, NKJV, ASV).<br>
 <a name="fn133" href="lam.htm#fnB133"><sup>133</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:21) <i> Heb</i> "the day." The translation "the time of judgment" clarifies the implicit sense of the idiom "the day." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;oy</FONT> ("day") is often used as a metonymy of association, standing for the event associated with that particular time period: judgment (e.g., Isa 2:12; 13:6, 9; Jer 46:10; Lam 2:22; Ezek 13:5; 30:3; Amos 5:18, 20; Obad 15; Zeph 1:7, 14; Zech 14:1; Mal 3:23) (BDB 399.3).<br>

Following a volitive use of the perfect, the <i>vav</i> prefixed to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wyhyw</FONT> ("and let it be!") introduces a purpose/result clause in a dependent volitive construction: "so that they may be like me!"<br>

 <a name="fn139" href="lam.htm#fnB139"><sup>139</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:22) <i> Heb</i> "is sorrowful" or "is faint." The adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yW&#180;d~</FONT> ("faint") is used in reference to emotional sorrow (e.g., Isa 1:5; Lam 1:22; Jer 8:18) (BDB 188; <i>HALOT</i> 1:216). The cognate Aramaic term means "sorrow," and the cognate Syriac term refers to "misery" (<i>HALOT</i> 1:216). The related Hebrew adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hw~D+</FONT> means "(physically) sick" and "(emotionally) sad" (BDB 188; <i>HALOT</i> 1:216), while the related Hebrew verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hw&#180;D&#180;</FONT> means "to be sad" (<i>HALOT</i> 1:216) due to menstruation (BDB 188). Other more literal translations fail to explicitly bring out the nuance of emotional sorrow and create possible confusion whether the problem is simply loss of courage: "my heart is faint" (KJV, NKJV, RSV, NRSV, ASV, NASB, NIV). The more paraphrastic translations explicate the emotional sorrow that this idiom connotes: "my heart is sick" (NJPS), "I am sick at heart" (TEV), and "I've lost all hope!" (CEV).<br>
 <a name="fn140" href="lam.htm#fnB140"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:1) The adverb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkya</FONT> is used as an exclamation of lament or desperation: "How!" (BDB 32.2) or "Alas!" (<i>HALOT</i> 1:40.1e). It often appears as the opening word in laments (Isa 1:21; Jer 48:17; Lam 1:1; 2:1; 4:1, 2). Like the less emphatic exclamation <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Eya</FONT> ("Alas!") (2 Sam 1:19; Isa 14:4, 12; Ezek 26:17), it is used in contexts of lament.<br>
 <b>sn </b> (2:1) The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ekya</FONT> ("Alas!") and its counterpart <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Eya</FONT> ("Alas!") are normally uttered in contexts of mourning as exclamation of lament and grief over a deceased person (2 Sam 1:19; Isa 14:4, 12). The prophets borrow this term from its normal <i>Sitz im Leben</i> in the funeral lament and rhetorically place it in the context of announcements or descriptions of God's judgment of cities or nations (Isa 1:21; Jer 48:17; Ezek 26:17; Lam 1:1; 2:1; 4:1, 2). This creates a personification of the city/nation which is either in danger of imminent "death" or already has "died" as a result of the LORD's judgment.<br>
 <a name="fn141" href="lam.htm#fnB141"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:1)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">byuy</FONT> is a <i>hapax legomena</i> (a term that appears only once in Hebrew OT). Most lexicons take it as a denominative verb from the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwu</FONT> "cloud" (<i>HALOT</i> 2:773; BDB 728): Hiphil imperfect 3ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwu</FONT> "cover with a cloud, make dark" (<i>HALOT</i> 2:794) or "becloud" (BDB 728): "the Lord has covered Daughter Zion with the cloud of His anger." This approach is followed by many translations (KJV, RSV, NASB, NIV). However, a few scholars relate it to a cognate Arabic verb "to blame, revile" (Ehrlich, Rudolph, Hillers): "the Lord has shamed Daughter Zion in His anger." Several translations adopt this (NRSV, NJPS, CEV).<br>

The term "horn" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/rq</FONT>) normally refers to the horn of a bull, one of the most powerful animals in ancient Israel. This term is often used figuratively as a symbol of strength, usually in reference to the military might of an army (Deut 33:17; 1 Sam 2:1, 10; 2 Sam 22:3; Pss 18:3; 75:11; 89:18, 25; 92:11; 112:9; 1 Chr 25:5; Jer 48:25; Lam 2:3, 17; Ezek 29:21) (BDB 901.2), just as warriors are sometimes figuratively described as "bulls."

This idiom is used figuratively to describe the assaults of the wicked (Pss 11:2; 37:14) and the judgments of the LORD (Ps 7:13; Lam 2:4; 3:12) (BDB 202.4). The translation "he has strung his bow" is the modern English idiomatic equivalent of the ancient Hebrew idiom "his has bent his bow"--both are preparations to get ready to shoot arrows.<br>

The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ec</FONT> "booth" (BDB 968) is a <i>hapax legomena</i> (term that appears only once in the Hebrew OT), but it is probably an alternate spelling of the more common noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hks</FONT> ("booth") which is used frequently of temporary shelters and booths (e.g., Neh 8:15) (BDB 697). Related to the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ekc</FONT> ("to weave"), it refers to a temporary dwelling constructed of interwoven boughs. This is a figurative description of the temple, as the parallel term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wduwm</FONT> ("his tabernacle" or "his appointed meeting place") makes clear. Jeremiah probably chose this term to emphasize the frailty of the temple, and its ease of destruction. Contrary to the expectation of Jerusalem, it was only a temporary dwelling of the LORD--its permanence cut short due to sin of the people.<br>

The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jkv</FONT> "to cause someone to forget" (Piel perfect 3ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jkv</FONT> "to forget") is used figuratively (metonymy): because the people could not worship in the temple any more, the festivals would, in a sense, be forgotten. Most translations render this in a metonymical sense: "the LORD has brought to an end in Zion appointed festival and sabbath" (RSV), "[he] did away with festivals and Sabbaths" (CEV), "he has put an end to holy days and Sabbaths" (TEV), "the LORD has ended...festival and sabbath" (NJPS), "the LORD has abolished...festivals and sabbath" (NRSV).

This expression, "her gates have sunk down into the ground," is a personification, picturing the city-gates descending into the earth, as if going down into the grave or the netherworld. Most translations render it literally (KJV, RSV, NRSV, NASB, NIV, NJPS); however, a few paraphrases have captured the equivalent sense quite well: "Zion's gates have fallen facedown on the ground" (CEV) and "the gates are buried in rubble" (TEV).<br>

The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Eru</FONT> normally means "to lay out, set in rows; to get ready, set in order; to line up for battle, set battle formation," but it also may denote "to compare (as a result of arranging in order), to make equal" (e.g., Pss 40:6; 89:6 [HT 7]; Job 28:17, 19; Isa 40:18; 44:7) (<i>HALOT</i> 2:885.4; BDB 789.2). The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest the emendation which involves simple orthographic confusion between <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">r</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">d</FONT>, and deletion of <i>yodh</i> that the MT added to make sense of the form. The variant is favored based on internal evidence: (1) it is the more difficult reading because the meaning "to compare" for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Eru</FONT> is less common than <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hdu</FONT> "to testify," (2) it recovers a tight parallelism between <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Eru</FONT> "to liken" and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmD</FONT> "to compare" (e.g., Ps 89:6 [HT 7]; Isa 40:18), and (3) the MT reading: "How can I testify for you?" makes little sense in the context. Nevertheless, most English translations hold to the MT reading: KJV, RSV, NRSV, NASB, NIV, TEV, CEV. This textual emendation was first proposed by J.

When used in collocation with verbs of cognition, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">har</FONT> means "to understand" (Isa 6:9) and "to see for oneself" or "to take notice" (1 Sam 26:12).

This temporal idiom refers to a general time period, but uses the term "day" as a forceful rhetorical device to emphasize the vividness and drama of the event, depicting it as occurring within a single day. In the ancient Near East, military minded kings often referred to a successful campaign as "the day of X" in order to portray themselves as powerful conquerors who, as it were, could inaugurate and complete a victory military campaign within the span of one day.<br>

(2) <i>HALOT</i> suggests that it is derived from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jpf</FONT> II and means "to give birth to healthy children" (<i>HALOT</i> 2:378). The recent lexicons suggest that it is related to Arabic <i>tafaha</i> "to bring forth fully formed children" and to Akkadian <i>tuppu</i> "to raise children" (<i>HALOT</i> 2:378). The latter is preferred. The use of this particular term highlights the tragic irony of what the army of Babylon has done: it has destroyed the lives of perfectly healthy children whom the women of Israel had raised.<br>
 <a name="fn281" href="lam.htm#fnB281"><sup>142</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:22)  This entire line is an accusative noun clause, functioning as the direct object of the following line: "my enemy has destroyed the perfectly healthy children..."

The imagery depicts the LORD building a wall to seal off personified Jerusalem with no way of escape out of the city, or the LORD blocking the road of escape. Siege imagery prevails in 3:4-6, but 3:7-9 pictures an unsuccessful escape that is thwarted due to blocked roads in 3:7 and 3:9.<br>

 <a name="fn337" href="lam.htm#fnB337"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:23) The adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">br</FONT> has a broad range of meanings: (1) quantitative: "much, numerous, many (with plurals), abundant, enough, exceedingly" (BDB 913.1) and (2) less often in a qualitative sense: "great" (a) of space and location, (b) "strong" as opposed to "weak" and (c) "major" (BDB 913.2). The traditional translation, "great is thy faithfulness," is less likely than the quantitative sense: "your faithfulness is abundant" [or, "plentiful"]. NJPS is on target in its translation: "Ample is your grace!"<br>

 <a name="fn342" href="lam.htm#fnB342"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:26)  <i>Heb</i> "waiting and silently." The two adjectives <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;mWdw lyjyw</FONT> ("waiting and silently") form a hendiadys: the first functions verbally and the second functions adverbially: "to wait silently." The adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;mWd</FONT> ("silently") also functions as a metonymy of association, standing for patience or rest (<i>HALOT</i> 1:217). This metonymical nuance is captured well in less literal translations: "wait in patience" (TEV) and "wait patiently" (CEV, NJPS). The more literal translations do not express the metonymy as well: "quietly wait" (KJV, NKJV, ASV), "waits silently" (NASB), "wait quietly" (RSV, NRSV, NIV).<br>

 <a name="fn346" href="lam.htm#fnB346"><sup>65</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:27)  Jeremiah is referring to the painful humiliation of subjugation to the Babylonians, particularly to the exile of the populace of Jerusalem. The Babylonians and Assyrians frequently used the phrase "bear the yoke" as a metaphor: their subjects were made as subservient to them as yoked oxen were to their masters. Because the Babylonian exile would last for seventy years, only those who were in their youth when Jerusalem fell would have any hope of living until the return of the remnant. For the middle-aged and elderly, the yoke of exile would be insufferable; but those who bore this "yoke" in their youth would have hope.<br>
 <a name="fn347" href="lam.htm#fnB347"><sup>66</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:27) <i> Heb</i> "in his youth." The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">b</FONT> functions in a temporal sense: "when."<br>

The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bbl</FONT> ("heart") is figurative: metonymy of association for emotions, standing for enjoyment, pleasure and desire (BDB 525.9a) (e.g., Exod 4:14; Judg 16:25; 18:20; 19:6, 22; Ruth 3:7; 1 Sam 2:1; 25:36; 2 Sam 13:28; 1 Kgs 8:66; 21:7; Est 1:10; 5:9; Job 29:13; Pss 4:8; 13:6; 16:9; 19:9; 21:3; 24:17; 28:7; 33:21; 37:4; 119:111; Prov 15:13, 15, 30; 17:22; 27:9, 11; Eccl 2:10; 5:19; 7:3; 9:7; 11:9; Song 3:11; Isa 24:7; 65:14; 66:14; Lam 5:15; Zeph 3:14; Zech 10:7).

 <a name="fn366" href="lam.htm#fnB366"><sup>85</sup></a><b>tc</b> (3:39)  Kethib reads the singular <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">oafj</FONT> ("his sin"), which is reflected in the LXX. Qere reads the plural <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wyafj</FONT> ("his sins") which is preserved in many medieval Hebrew MSS and reflected in the other versions (Aramaic Targum, Syriac Peshitta, Latin Vulgate). The external and internal evidence are not decisive in favor of either reading.<br>
 <b>tn</b> (3:39) <i> Heb</i> "concerning his punishment." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">afj</FONT> has a broad range of meanings: (1) "sin," (2) "guilt of sin" and (3) "punishment for sin," which fits the context of calamity as discipline and punishment for sin (BDB 308.3) (e.g., Lev 19:17; 20:20; 22:9; 24:15; Num 9:13; 18:22, 32; Isa 53:12; Lam 3:39; Ezek 23:49). The metonymical (cause-effect) relation between sin and punishment is clear in the expressions <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twm fpvm afj</FONT> "sin deserving death penalty" (Deut 21:22) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twm afj </FONT>"sin unto death" (Deut 22:26) (<i>HALOT</i> 1:306.2). The point of this verse is that the punishment of sin can sometimes lead to death; therefore, any one who is being punished by God for his sins - and yet is allowed to live - has nothing to complain about!<br>
 <a name="fn367" href="lam.htm#fnB367"><sup>86</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:40)  <i>Heb</i> "Let us test our ways and examine." The two verbs <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrqjnw hcPjn</FONT> ("Let us test and let us examine") form a verbal hendiadys in which the first functions adverbially and the second retains its full verbal force: "Let us carefully examine our ways."<br>
 <a name="fn368" href="lam.htm#fnB368"><sup>87</sup></a><b>tc</b> (3:41)  The MT reads the singular noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wnbbl</FONT> ("our heart") but the versions (LXX, Aramaic Targum, Latin Vulgate) and many medieval Hebrew MSS read the plural noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wnybbl</FONT> ("our hearts"). External evidence favors the plural and internal evidence can explain the origin of the singular variant based on simple orthographic confusion.<br>
 <a name="fn369" href="lam.htm#fnB369"><sup>88</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:42) <i> Heb</i> "We have revolted and we have rebelled."

The two nouns <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">swamW yjs</FONT> probably form a nominal hendiadys, in which the first noun functions as an adjective and the second retains its full nominal sense: "filthy excrement."<br>
 <a name="fn372" href="lam.htm#fnB372"><sup>91</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:45) <i> Heb</i> "in the midst of."<br>
 <a name="fn373" href="lam.htm#fnB373"><sup>92</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:46) <i> Heb</i> "open wide their mouths." Used in reference to an enemy, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hxP</FONT> ("to open the mouth wide") means to utter threats against someone (Ps 22:14; Lam 2:16; 3:46) (<i>HALOT</i> 2:953.c).<br>

 <a name="fn376" href="lam.htm#fnB376"><sup>95</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:48) <i> Heb</i> "rivers." The phrase "rivers of tears" is an example of hyperbole. The English idiom "streams of tears" is the English idiom, but it as well is hyperbolic.<br>

The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hgoph</FONT> ("stop") is a <i>hapax legomena</i> (word that occurs only once in Hebrew scriptures). The form of the noun is unusual, probably being derived from the denominative Hiphil verbal stem of the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gWP</FONT> ("to grow weary, ineffective; numb, become cold") (BDB 806; <i>HALOT</i> 1:253; 2:916).<br>

 <a name="fn389" href="lam.htm#fnB389"><sup>108</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:54)  <i>Heb</i> "I said."<br>
 <a name="fn390" href="lam.htm#fnB390"><sup>109</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:54) <i> Heb</i> "I was about to be cut off." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yTrzgn</FONT> (Niphal perfect 1cs from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rzG</FONT> "to be cut off") functions in an ingressive sense: "about to be cut off." It is used in reference to the threat of death (e.g., Ezek 37:11) (BDB 160.2). To be "cut off" from the hand of the living means to experience death (Ps 88:6).<br>

 <a name="fn400" href="lam.htm#fnB400"><sup>119</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:63) <i> Heb</i> "their rising and their sitting." The two terms <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;tnyqw &lt;Tbv</FONT> ("their sitting and their rising") form a merism: two terms that are polar opposites are used to encompass everything in between. The idiom "from your rising to your sitting" refers to the earliest action in the morning and the latest action in the evening (e.g., Deut 6:7; Ps 139:3). The enemies mock Jerusalem from the moment they arise in the morning until the moment they sit down in the evening.<br>
 <a name="fn401" href="lam.htm#fnB401"><sup>120</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:64) <i> Heb</i> "Please cause to return." The imperfect verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">byvT</FONT> (Hiphil imperfect 2ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv</FONT> "to return") functions in a volitional sense, like an imperative of request. The Hiphil stem of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv</FONT> ("to cause to return") often means "to make requital, to pay back" (e.g., Judg 9:5, 56; 1 Sam 25:39; 1 Kgs 2:32, 44; Neh 3:36; Prov 24:12, 29; Hos 12:3; Joel 4:4, 7) (BDB 999.4a).<br>
 <a name="fn402" href="lam.htm#fnB402"><sup>121</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:64) <i> Heb</i> "recompense to them." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lWmG</FONT> ("dealing, accomplishment") has two metonymical (cause-effect) meanings: (1) positive "benefit" and (2) negative "retribution, requital, recompense" (BDB 168.2; <i>HALOT</i> 1:196.2), the sense used here (e.g., Pss 28:4; 94:2; 137:8; Prov 19:17; Isa 35:4; 59:18; 66:6; Jer 51:6; Lam 3:64; Joel 4:4, 7). The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lWmG byvT</FONT> means "to pay back retribution" (e.g., Joel 4:4, 7), that is, to return the deeds of the wicked upon them as a display of talionic or poetic justice.<br>
 <a name="fn403" href="lam.htm#fnB403"><sup>122</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:64) <i> Heb</i> "their hands." The term "hand" is a synecdoche of part (= hands) for the whole person (= they).<br>

 <a name="fn405" href="lam.htm#fnB405"><sup>124</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:65)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hNgm</FONT> is a <i>hapax legomena</i> (term that appears only once in the Hebrew scriptures). Its meaning is debated: earlier lexicographers suggested that it meant "covering" (BDB 171), but more recent lexicons suggest "shamelessness" or "insanity" (<i>HALOT</i> 2:546). <br>
 <a name="fn406" href="lam.htm#fnB406"><sup>125</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:66) <i> Heb</i> "pursue." The accusative direct object is implied in the Hebrew, and inserted in the translation.<br>

 <a name="fn408" href="lam.htm#fnB408"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn </b> (4:1) The adverb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkya</FONT> is used as an exclamation of lament or desperation: "How!" (BDB 32.2) or "Alas!" (<i>HALOT</i> 1:40.1e). It often appears as the opening word in laments (Isa 1:21; Jer 48:17; Lam 1:1; 2:1; 4:1, 2). The less emphatic exclamation <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Eya</FONT> ("Alas!") is used in contexts of mourning (2 Sam 1:19; Isa 14:4, 12; Ezek 26:17) (<i>HALOT</i> 1:39.5).<br>
 <b>sn </b> (4:1) The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ekya</FONT> ("Alas!") and its counterpart <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Eya</FONT> ("Alas!") are normally uttered in contexts of mourning as exclamation of lament and grief over a deceased person (2 Sam 1:19; Isa 14:4, 12). The prophets borrow this term from its normal <i>Sitz im Leben</i> in the funeral lament and rhetorically place it in the context of announcements or descriptions of God's judgment of cities or nations (Isa 1:21; Jer 48:17; Ezek 26:17; Lam 1:1; 2:1; 4:1, 2). This creates a personification of the city/nation which is either in danger of imminent "death" or already has "died" as a result of the LORD's judgment.<br>
 <a name="fn409" href="lam.htm#fnB409"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:1)  <i>Heb</i> "had grown dim." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;uWy</FONT> (Hophal imperfect 3ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;mu</FONT> "to conceal, darken") literally means "to be dimmed" (BDB 770) or "to be darkened" (<i>HALOT</i> 2:846). Most translations render this literally: the gold has "become dim" (KJV, NKJV), "grown dim" (RSV, NRSV), "is dulled" (NJPS), "grown dull" (TEV); however, but NIV has captured the sense well: "How the gold has lost its luster."<br>
 <a name="fn410" href="lam.htm#fnB410"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:1)  <i>Heb</i> "the pure gold."<br>

Here, it describes people dying from hunger (BDB 201; <i>HALOT</i> 1:230).

Used in reference to God's wrath, it describes God unleashing his full measure of anger so that divine justice is satisfied. This is handled admirably by several translations: "The LORD has given full vent to his wrath" (NIV), "The LORD gave full vent to his wrath" (RSV, NRSV), "The LORD vented all his fury" (NJPS), "The LORD turned loose the full force of his fury" (TEV).

Ancient Near Eastern fortified cities typically featured double and sometimes triple city gates - the bulwark of the defense of the city. Because fortified cities were enclosed with protective walls, the achilles tendon of every city was the city gates - the weak point in the defense and the perennial point of attack by enemies (e.g., Judg 5:8, 11; 1 Sam 17:52; Isa 29:6; Jer 17:27; 51:54; Ezek 21:20, 27; Mic 1:9, 12; Neh 1:3; 2:3, 13, 17).<br>

Just as a cup of poison kills all those who are forced to drink it, the cup of God's wrath destroys all those who must drink it (e.g., Ps 75:9; Isa 51:17, 22; Jer 25:15, 17, 28; 49:12; 51:7; Lam 4:21; Ezek 23:33; Hab 2:16) (BDB 468).<br>

The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ou</FONT> has a broad range of meanings, including: (1) iniquity, (2) guilt of iniquity, and (3) consequence or punishment for iniquity (cause-effect metonymical relation).

The perfect tense verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;T</FONT> "will come to an end" (Qal perfect 3ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;mT</FONT> "to be complete") is an example of the so-called "prophetic perfect." The perfect tense often describes actions that are viewed as complete (normally past- or present-time events). When the perfect tense describes a future event, it often depicts it as "complete," that is, "as good as done" or certain to take place from the viewpoint of the prophet. Thus, by using the perfect tense, Jeremiah may be emphasizing the certainty that the exile will eventually come to an end.<br>

 <a name="fn486" href="lam.htm#fnB486"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:1) <i> Heb</i> "remember." Although often used of recollection of past events, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rkz</FONT> ("to remember") can also describe consideration of present situations: "to consider, think about" something present (BDB 270.5) - the most appropriate nuance here. Verses 1-6 describe the present plight of Jerusalem. The parallel requests <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">harW fyBh </FONT>("Look and see!") have a present-time orientation as well, demanding that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rkz</FONT> be nuanced "consider!" rather than "remember!"<br>
 <a name="fn487" href="lam.htm#fnB487"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:1) <i> Heb</i> "Look!" Although often used in reference to visual perception, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">fbn</FONT> ("to look") can also refer to cognitive consideration and mental attention shown to a situation: "to regard" (e.g., 1 Sam 16:7; 2 Kgs 3:14), "to pay attention to, consider" (e.g., Isa 22:8; Isa 51:1, 2) (BDB 613.2).<br>

Although normally used in reference to visual sight, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">har</FONT> ("to see") is often used in reference to cognitive processes and mental observation: "give attention to, take heed" (e.g., Exod 10:10; 25:40; 2 Sam 13:28; 1 Kgs 12:16; 2 Kgs 6:32; 10:23; 2 Chr 10:16; Ps 45:11; Jer 2:31) (BDB 907.7c).<br>
 <a name="fn489" href="lam.htm#fnB489"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:1)  <i>Heb</i> "our disgrace." The 1cpl suffix functions as a subjective genitive: "we are suffering disgrace."<br>

 <a name="fn491" href="lam.htm#fnB491"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn<i> </i></b> (5:2) <i>Heb</i> "Our inheritance"; or "Our inherited possessions/property." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hljn</FONT> has a range of meanings: (1) "inheritance," (2) "portion, share" and (3) "possession, property" (BDB 635). The land of Canaan was given by the LORD to Israel as its inheritance (Deut 4:21; 15:4; 19:10; 20:16; 21:23; 24:4; 25:19; 26:1; Josh 20:6) and distributed among the tribes, clans and families (Num 16:14; 36:2; Deut 29:7; Josh 11:23; 13:6; 14:3, 13; 17:4, 6, 14; 19:49; 23:4; Judg 18:1; Ezek 45:1; 47:22, 29). Through the family, the family provided an inheritance (property) to its children with the first-born receiving pride of position (Gen 31:14; Num 27:7-11; 36:3, 8; 1 Kgs 21:3, 4; Job 42:15; Prov 19:14; Ezek 46:16). Here, the parallelism between "our inheritance" and "our homes" would allow for the specific referent of the phrase "our inheritance" to be (1) land or (2) material possessions. This is an example of synecdoche of general (= inheritance) for specific (= land).<br>

The Qere is supported by many medieval Hebrew MSS, as well as most of the versions (Aramaic Targum, Syriac Peshitta, Latin Vulgate). The <i>vav</i> prefixed to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wnjnaw</FONT> functions either in a disjunctive sense ("but") or resultant sense ("so").<br>

The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ou</FONT> has a broad range of meanings, including: (1) iniquity, (2) guilt of iniquity, and (3) consequence or punishment for iniquity (cause-effect metonymical relation). The context suggests that "punishment for sin" is most appropriate here (e.g., Gen 4:13; 19:15; Exod 28:38, 43; Lev 5:1, 17; 7:18; 10:17; 16:22; 17:16; 19:8; 20:17, 19; 22:16; 26:39, 41, 43; Num 5:31; 14:34; 18:1, 23; 30:15; 1 Sam 25:24; 28:10; 2 Sam 14:9; 2 Kgs 7:9; Job 10:14; Pss 31:11; 69:28; 106:43; Prov 5:22; Isa 5:18; 30:13; 40:2; 53:6, 11; 64:5, 6; Jer 51:6; Lam 4:22; 5:7; Ezek 4:4-6, 17; 7:16; 14:10; 18:19-20; 21:30, 34; 24:23; 32:27; 35:5; 39:23; 44:10, 12) (BDB 731.3).<br>
 <a name="fn505" href="lam.htm#fnB505"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:8)  <i>Heb</i> "slaves." The expression "slaves rule over us" might be an idiom for "tyrants rule over us." This might find its counterpart in the gnomic truth that the most ruthless rulers are made of former slaves: "Under three things the earth quakes, under four it cannot bear up: under a slave when he becomes king" (Prov 30:21-22a).<br>

The expression <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WnvpnB</FONT> means "at the risk of our lives" (BDB 90.3a). Similar expressions include <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ovpnb</FONT> "at the cost of his life" (1 Kgs 2:23; Prov 7:23) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;tovnpb</FONT> "at peril of their lives" (2 Sam 23:17). To venture out from their hiding-places to search for food was a risky proposal; it meant that they would be exposed and out in the open, where their enemies could make easy prey of them.<br>
 <a name="fn508" href="lam.htm#fnB508"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:9) <i> Heb</i> "our soul." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vpn</FONT> ("soul") is used as a metonymy (= soul) of association (= life) (e.g., Gen 44:30; Exod 21:23; 2 Sam 14:7; Jon 1:14) (BDB 659.2c).<br>

The related adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwD</FONT> means "(physically) sick" and "(emotionally) sad" (BDB 188; <i>HALOT</i> 1:216), while the related verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwD</FONT> means "to be sad" (<i>HALOT</i> 1:216). The cognate Aramaic term means "sorrow," and the cognate Syriac term refers to "misery" (<i>HALOT</i> 1:216). <br>

 <a name="fn533" href="lam.htm#fnB533"><sup>48</sup></a><b>sn </b> (5:20) The verbs "to forget" and "to remember" are often used figuratively in scripture when God is the subject, particularly in contexts of judgment (God has forgotten his people) and restoration of blessing (God remembers his people). In this case, the verb "to forget" functions as a hypocatastasis (implied comparison), drawing a comparison between God's judgment and rejection of Jerusalem to a person forgetting that Jerusalem even exists. God's judgment of Jerusalem was so intense and enduring that it seemed as though he had forgotten her. The synonymous parallelism between "Why have you forgotten us...?" and "Why have you forsaken us...?" makes this clear.<br>
 <a name="fn534" href="lam.htm#fnB534"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tc</b> (5:21)  The Kethib is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWvnw</FONT> "and we will return" (<i>vav</i> conjunction + Qal imperfect 1cpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv</FONT> "to return"). The Qere is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbWvnw</FONT> "and let us return" (<i>vav</i> conjunction + Qal cohortative 1cpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv</FONT> "to return").<br>
 <b>tn</b> (5:21)  There is a wordplay in Hebrew between "Bring us back" (Hiphil imperative of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv</FONT> "to return") and "let us return" (Qal imperfect of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv</FONT> "to return"). This repetition of the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv</FONT> is significant; it depicts a reciprocal relationship between God's willingness to allow the nation to return to Him and its national repentance.<br>
 <a name="fn535" href="lam.htm#fnB535"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:21) <i> Heb</i> "renew."<br>
 <a name="fn536" href="lam.htm#fnB536"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:21) <i> Heb</i> "our days." The term "days" is a synecdoche of time (= days) for what is experienced within that time span (= life) (e.g., Gen 5:4, 8, 11; 6:3; 9:29; 11:32; 25:7; 47:8, 9; Deut 22:19, 29; 23:7; Josh 24:31; Judg 2:7, 18; 2 Sam 19:35; Job 7:1, 16, 18; Pss 8:9; 39:5, 6; 90:9, 10, 12, 14; 103:15; Prov 31:12; Eccl 2:3; 5:17, 19; 6:3) (BDB 399.4a). For example, Jesus prayed, "May I be delivered from this hour (= events which he would experience within that time period)." Just as Isaiah prophesied that the LORD would restore Israel's former prominence as in days of old (Isa 1:26), Jerusalem is praying that the LORD would restore the national existence (= life) of Jerusalem to the glorious status marked by former days. Fittingly, TEV renders this line as: "Restore our ancient glory."<br>
 <a name="fn537" href="lam.htm#fnB537"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:21) <i> Heb</i> "as of old."<br>
 <a name="fn538" href="lam.htm#fnB538"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn </b> (5:22) The compound conjunction <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;a yK</FONT> functions to limit the preceding clause: "unless, or..." (e.g., Ruth 3:18; Isa 65:6; Amos 3:7; Lam 5:22) (BDB 474.2a): "Return us to yourself... <i>unless</i> you have utterly rejected us" or "Return us to yourself...<i>Or</i> have you utterly rejected us?" (BDB 474.2a). It is Jeremiah's plea that the LORD be willing to relent of his anger and restore a repentant nation to himself; however, Jeremiah acknowledges that this wished for restoration might not be possible if the LORD has become so angry with Jerusalem/Judah that he is determined to reject the nation once and for all. Then, Jerusalem/Judah's restoration would be impossible.<br>
 <a name="fn539" href="lam.htm#fnB539"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:22) <i> Heb</i> "Or have you utterly rejected us?" The construction <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WnTsam sam</FONT> (Qal infinitive absolute + Qal perfect 2ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">sam</FONT> "to reject") is emphatic: the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">sam</FONT> is repeated in these two verbal forms for emphasis.<br>
 <a name="fn540" href="lam.htm#fnB540"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:22) <i> Heb</i> "Are you exceedingly angry with us?" The construction <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dam-du</FONT> means "up to an abundance, to a great degree, exceedingly" (BDB 547.2b) (e.g., Gen 27:33, 34; 1 Sam 11:15; 25:36; 2 Sam 2:17; 1 Kgs 1:4; Pss 38:7, 9; 119:8, 43, 51, 107; Isa 64:9, 12; Lam 5:22; Dan 8:8; 11:25). Used in reference to God's judgment, this phrase denotes total and irrevocable rejection by God and his refusal to forgive the sin and restore the people to a status under his grace and blessings, e.g., "Do not be angry beyond measure (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dam-du</FONT>), O LORD; do not remember our sins forever" (Isa 64:9) and "Will you keep silent and punish us beyond measure (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dam-du</FONT>)?" (Isa 64:12). The sentiment is expressed well in the less literal translations: "Or have you rejected us forever? Is there no limit to your anger?" (TEV) and "Or do you despise us so much that you don't want us?" (CEV).
