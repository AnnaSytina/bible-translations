 <b>sn</b> (1:1)  <i>In the beginning. </i>The search for the basic "stuff" out of which things are made was the earliest one in Greek philosophy. It was attended by the related question of "What is the process by which the secondary things came out of the primary one (or ones)?," or in Aristotelian terminology, "What is the `beginning' (same Greek word as <i>beginning</i>, John 1:1) and what is the origin of the things that are made?" In the New Testament the word usually has a temporal sense, but even BAGD 112 s.v. 2 lists the second major category of meaning as "the first cause." For John, the words "In the beginning" are most likely a conscious allusion to the opening words of Genesis--"In the beginning." Other concepts which occur prominently in Gen 1 are also found in John's prologue: "life" (1:4) "light" (1:4) and "darkness" (1:5). Gen 1 describes the first (physical) creation; John 1 describes the new (spiritual) creation. But this is not to play off a false dichotomy between "physical" and "spiritual"; the first creation was both physical and spiritual. The new creation is really a re-creation, of the spiritual (first) but also the physical. (In spite of the common understanding of John's `spiritual' emphasis, the "physical" recreation should not be overlooked; this occurs in John 2 with the changing of water into wine, in John 11 with the resurrection of Lazarus, and the emphasis of John 20-21 on the aftermath of Jesus' own resurrection.)<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="joh.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">prov"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">pros</FONT>) implies not just proximity, but intimate personal relationship. M. Dods stated, "<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Prov"</FONT> ...means more than <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">metav</FONT> or <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">parav</FONT>, and is regularly employed in expressing the presence of one person with another" ("The Gospel of St. John," <i>The Expositor</i>'<i>s Greek Testament</i>, 1:684). See also Mark 6:3, Matt 13:56, Mark 9:19, Gal 1:18, 2 John 12.<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="joh.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  Or "and what God was, the Word was too"; or "and the Word was fully God." Colwell's Rule is often invoked to support the translation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">qeos</FONT>) as definite ("God") rather than indefinite here. However, Colwell's Rule merely <i>permits</i>, but does not demand, that a predicate nominative ahead of an equative verb be translated as definite rather than indefinite. Furthermore, Colwell's Rule did not deal with a third possibility, that the anarthrous predicate noun may have more of a qualitative nuance when placed ahead of the verb. Orthodox Christian theology would permit either a definite or a qualitative meaning for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov"</FONT> here. From a technical standpoint, though, it is probably preferable to see something of a qualitative aspect to anarthrous <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov"</FONT> in John 1:1. Translations like the NEB, REB, and Moffatt are helpful in capturing the sense in John 1:1, that the Word was fully deity in essence (just as much God as God the Father). However, in contemporary English "the Word was divine" does not quite catch the meaning since "divine" as a descriptive term is not used in English exclusively of God. Thus the translation "what God was, the Word was too" is more likely to convey the meaning to the average English reader.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:1)  <i>And the Word was God.</i> John's theology consistently drives toward the conclusion that Jesus, the incarnate Word, is just as much God as God the Father. This can be seen, for example, in John's use of the verb "worship" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">proskunevw</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">proskunew</FONT>) with Jesus as object in John 9:38, a word that elsewhere in John (4:21, 23-24) has only God the Father as its object. The construction in John 1:1c does not equate the Word with the <i>person</i> of God; rather it equates the <i>essence</i> of the Word with that of God.<br>

 <a name="fn6" href="joh.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:3)  There is a major punctuation problem here: should this relative clause go with v. 3 or v. 4? The earliest MSS have no punctuation (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>66 <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>75* <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT>* A B <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">D</FONT>). Many of the later MSS which do have punctuation place it before the phrase, thus putting it with v. 4 (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>75<sup>c</sup> C D L <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Q</FONT> <i>al</i>). NA25<sup> </sup>placed the phrase in v. 3; NA26 moved the words to the beginning of v. 4. In a detailed article K. Aland defended the change ("Eine Untersuchung zu Johannes 1, 3-4. &Uuml;ber die Bedeutung eines Punktes," <i>ZNW </i>59 [1968]: 174-209). He sought to prove that the attribution of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o} gevgonen</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">}o gegonen</FONT>) to v. 3 began to be carried out in the 4th<sup> </sup>century in the Greek church. This came out of the Arian controversy, and was intended as a safeguard for doctrine. The change was unknown in the West. Aland is probably correct in affirming that the phrase was attached to v. 4 by the Gnostics and the Eastern Church; only when the Arians began to use them were they attached to v. 3. But this does not rule out the possibility that, by moving the words from v. 4 to v. 3, one is restoring the original reading. Understanding the words as part of v. 3 is natural and adds to the emphasis which is built up there; while it also gives a terse, forceful statement in v. 4. On the other hand, taking the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o} gevgonen</FONT> with v. 4 gives a complicated expression: C. K. Barrett says that both ways of understanding v. 4 with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o} gevgonen</FONT> included `are almost impossibly clumsy' (<i>St. John</i>, 157): "That which came into being--in it the Word was life"; "That which came into being--in the Word was its life." The following stylistic points should be noted in the solution of this problem: (1) John frequently starts sentences with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">en</FONT>); (2) he repeats frequently ("nothing was created that has been created"); (3) 5:26 and 6:53 both give a sense similar to v. 4 if it is understood without the phrase; (4) it makes far better Johannine sense to say that in the Word was life than to say that the created universe (what was made, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o} gevgonen</FONT>) was life in him. In conclusion: The phrase is best taken with v. 3. Schnackenburg, Barrett, Carson, Haenchen, Morris, KJV, and NIV concur (against Brown, Beasley-Murray, and NEB). The arguments of R. Schnackenburg, <i>The Gospel According to St. John</i>, 1:239-40, are particularly persuasive.<br>
 <b>tn</b> (1:3)  Or "made"; <i>Grk</i> "that has come into existence." <br>
 <a name="fn7" href="joh.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  John uses <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">zwhv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">zwh</FONT>) 37 times: 17 times it occurs with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aijwvnio"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">aiwnios</FONT>), and in the remaining occurrences outside the prologue it is clear from context that `eternal' life is meant. The two uses in 1:4, if they do not refer to `eternal' life, would be the only exceptions. (Also 1 John uses <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">zwhv</FONT> 13 times, always of `eternal' life.)<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:4)  An allusion to Ps 36:9, which gives significant OT background: "For with you is the fountain of life; In your light we see light." In later Judaism, Bar 4:2 expresses a similar idea. Life, especially eternal life, will become one of the major themes of John's Gospel.<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="joh.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  <i>Grk</i> "of men" (but in a generic sense, not restricted to males only, thus "mankind").<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="joh.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  Up till now the author has used past tenses (imperfects, aorists); now he switches to a present. The light continually shines (thus the translation, "shines on"). Even as the author writes, it is shining. The present here most likely has gnomic force (though it possible to take it as a historical present); it expresses the timeless truth that the light of the world (cf. 8:12, 9:5, 12:46) never ceases to shine.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:5)  <i>The light shines on. </i>The question of whether John has in mind here the pre-incarnate Christ or the incarnate Christ is probably too specific. The incarnation is not really introduced until v. 9, but here the point is more general: it is of the very nature of <i>light</i>, that it <i>shines</i>.<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="joh.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:5)  The author now introduces what will become a major theme of John's Gospel: the opposition of <i>light</i> and <i>darkness</i>. The antithesis is a natural one, widespread in antiquity. Gen 1 gives considerable emphasis to it in the account of the creation, and so do the writings of Qumran. It is the major theme of one of the most important extra-biblical documents found at Qumran, the so-called War Scroll, properly titled <i>The War of the Sons of Light with the Sons of Darkness</i>. Connections between John and Qumran are still an area of scholarly debate and a consensus has not yet emerged. See T. A. Hoffman, "1 John and the Qumran Scrolls," <i>BTB </i>8 (1978): 177-21.<br>
 <a name="fn11" href="joh.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Grk</i> "and," but the context clearly indicates a contrast, so this is translated as an adversative use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="joh.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  Or "comprehended it," or "overcome it." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">katevlaben</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">katelaben</FONT>) is not easy to translate. "To seize" or "to grasp" is possible, but this also permits "to grasp with the mind" in the sense of "to comprehend" (esp. in the middle voice). This is probably another Johannine double meaning--one does not usually think of darkness as trying to "understand" light. For it to mean this, "darkness" must be understood as meaning "certain people," or perhaps "humanity" at large, darkened in understanding. But in John's usage, darkness is not normally used of people or a group of people. Rather it usually signifies the evil environment or `sphere' in which people find themselves: "They loved darkness rather than light" (John 3:19). Those who follow Jesus do not walk in darkness (8:12). They are to walk while they have light, lest the darkness "overtake/overcome" them (12:35, same verb as here). For John, with his set of symbols and imagery, darkness is not something which seeks to "understand (comprehend)" the light, but represents the forces of evil which seek to "overcome (conquer)" it. The English verb "to master" may be used in both sorts of contexts, as "he mastered his lesson" and "he mastered his opponent."<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="joh.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:6)  <i>John</i> refers to John the Baptist.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (1:7)  <i>Witness</i> is also one of the major themes of John's Gospel. The Greek verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">marturevw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">marturew</FONT>) occurs 33 times (compare to once in Matthew, once in Luke, 0 in Mark) and the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">marturiva</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">marturia</FONT>) 14 times (0 in Matthew, once in Luke, 3 times in Mark).<br>

 <a name="fn19" href="joh.htm#fnB19"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  Or "He was the true light, who gives light to everyone who comes into the world." The participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejrcovmenon</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ercomenon</FONT>) may be either (1) neuter nominative, agreeing with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">toV fw'"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">to fw"</FONT>), or (2) masculine accusative, agreeing with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">a[nqrwpon</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">anqrwpon</FONT>). Option (1) results in a periphrastic imperfect with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">h\n</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">hn</FONT>), <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">h\n toV fw'"... ejrcovmenon</FONT>, referring to the incarnation. Option (2) would have the participle modifying <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">a[nqrwpon</FONT> and referring to the true light as enlightening "every man who comes into the world." Option (2) has some rabbinic parallels: the phrase "all who come into the world" is a fairly common expression for "every man" (cf. <i>Leviticus</i> <i>Rabbah</i> 31.6). But (1) must be preferred here, because: (a) In the next verse the light is in the world; it is logical for v. 9 to speak of its entering the world; (b) in other passages Jesus is described as "coming into the world" (6:14, 9:39, 11:27, 16:28) and in 12:46 Jesus says: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejgwV fw'" eij" toVn kovsmon ejlhvluqa</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">egw fw" ei" ton kosmon elhluqa</FONT>); (c) use of a periphrastic participle with the imperfect tense is typical Johannine style: 1:28, 2:6, 3:23, 10:40, 11:1, 13:23, 18:18 and 25. In every one of these except 13:23 the finite verb is first and separated by one or more intervening words from the participle.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:9)  In v. 9 the <i>world</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kovsmo"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kosmos</FONT>) is mentioned for the first time. This is another important theme word for John. Generally, <i>the world</i> as a Johannine concept does not refer to the totality of creation (the universe), although there are exceptions at 11:9. 17:5, 24, 21:25, but to the world of human beings and human affairs. Even in 1:10 the world created through the <i>Logos</i> is a world capable of knowing (or reprehensibly not knowing) its Creator. Sometimes <i>the world</i> is further qualified as <i>this world</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJ kovsmo" ou|to"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jo kosmos Joutos</FONT>) as in 8:23, 9:39, 11:9, 12:25, 31; 13:1, 16:11, 18:36. This is not merely equivalent to the rabbinic phrase "this present age"(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJ aijwvn ou|to"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jo aiwn Joutos</FONT>) and contrasted with "the world to come." For John it is also contrasted to a world other than this one, already existing; this is the lower world, corresponding to which there is a world above (see especially 8:23, 18:36). Jesus appears not only as the Messiah by means of whom an eschatological future is anticipated (as in the synoptic gospels) but also as an envoy from the heavenly world to <i>this world</i>.<br>

 <a name="fn26" href="joh.htm#fnB26"><sup>27</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:11)  <i>His own people did not receive him. </i>There is a subtle irony here: when the<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek"> lovgo"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">logos</FONT>) came into the world, he came to his <i>own</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">taV i[dia</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ta idia</FONT>, literally "his own things") and his own people (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oiJ i[dioi</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joi idioi</FONT>), who should have known and received him, but they did not. This time John does not say that "his own" did not know him, but that they <i>did not receive him</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">parevlabon</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">parelabon</FONT>). The idea is one not of mere recognition, but of acceptance and welcome.<br>
 <a name="fn27" href="joh.htm#fnB27"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:12)  On the use of the<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek"> pisteuvw</FONT> + <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">pisteuw</FONT> + <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ei"</FONT>) construction in John: the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pisteuvw</FONT> occurs 98 times in John (compared to 11 times in Matthew, 14 times in Mark (including the longer ending), and 9 times in Luke). One of the unsolved mysteries is why the corresponding noun form <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pivsti"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">pistis</FONT>) is never used at all. Many have held the noun was in use in some pre-Gnostic sects and this rendered it suspect for John. It might also be that for John, faith was an activity, something that men do (cf. W. Turner, "Believing and Everlasting Life--A Johannine Inquiry," <i>ExpTim </i>64 [1952/53]: 50-52). John uses <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pisteuvw</FONT> in 4 major ways: (1) of believing facts, reports, etc., 12 times; (2) of believing people (or the scriptures), 19 times; (3) of believing "in" Christ" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pisteuvw</FONT> + <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij"</FONT> + acc.), 36 times; (4) used absolutely without any person or object specified, 30 times (the one remaining passage is 2:24, where Jesus refused to "trust" himself to certain individuals). Of these, the most significant is the use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pisteuvw</FONT> with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij"</FONT> + accusative. It is not unlike the Pauline <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn Cristw'/</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">en Cristw</FONT>) formula. Some have argued that this points to a Hebrew (more likely Aramaic) original behind the Fourth Gospel. But it probably indicates something else, as C. H. Dodd observed: "<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pisteuvein</FONT> with the dative so inevitably connoted simple credence, in the sense of an intellectual judgment, that the moral element of personal trust or reliance inherent in the Hebrew or Aramaic phrase--an element integral to the primitive Christian conception of faith in Christ--needed to be otherwise expressed" (<i>The Interpretation of the Fourth Gospel</i>, 183).<br>
 <a name="fn28" href="joh.htm#fnB28"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13)  The Greek term translated "born" here also involves conception.<br>
 <a name="fn29" href="joh.htm#fnB29"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13)  <i>Grk</i> "of blood(s)." The plural <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aiJmavtwn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jaimatwn</FONT>) has seemed a problem to many interpreters. At least some sources in antiquity imply that blood was thought of as being important in the development of the fetus during its time in the womb: thus Wis 7:1: "in the womb of a mother I was molded into flesh, within the period of 10 months, compacted with blood, from the seed of a man and the pleasure of marriage." In John 1:13, the plural <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aiJmavtwn</FONT> may imply the action of both parents. It may also refer to the `genetic' contribution of both parents, and so be equivalent to "human descent" (see BAGD 22 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ai|ma</FONT>). E. C. Hoskyns thinks John could not have used the singular here because Christians are in fact `begotten' by the blood of Christ (<i>The Fourth Gospel</i>, 143), although the context would seem to make it clear that the blood in question is something other than the blood of Christ.<br>
 <a name="fn30" href="joh.htm#fnB30"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13)  Or "of the will of the flesh." The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oujdeV ejk qelhvmato" sarkov"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">oude ek qelhmato" sarko"</FONT>) is more clearly a reference to sexual desire, but it should be noted that <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">savrx</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">sarx</FONT>) in John does not convey the evil sense common in Pauline usage. For John it refers to the physical nature in its weakness rather than in its sinfulness. There is no clearer confirmation of this than the immediately following verse, where the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">lovgo"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">logos</FONT>) became <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">savrx</FONT>.<br>
 <a name="fn31" href="joh.htm#fnB31"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13)  Or "man's."<br>
 <a name="fn32" href="joh.htm#fnB32"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13)  The third phrase, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oujdeV ejk qelhvmato" ajndrov"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">oude ek qelhmato" andros</FONT>), means much the same as the second one. The word here (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajnhr</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">anhr</FONT>) is often used for a husband, resulting in the translation "or a husband's decision," or more generally, "or of any human volition whatsoever." L. Morris may be right when he sees here an emphasis directed at the Jewish pride in race and patriarchal ancestry, although such a specific reference is difficult to prove (<i>John </i>[NICNT]<i>,</i> 101).<br>
 <a name="fn33" href="joh.htm#fnB33"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:14)  Here <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>) has been translated as "now" to indicate the transition to a new topic, the incarnation of the Word. Greek style often begins sentences or clauses with "and," but English style generally does not.<br>
 <a name="fn34" href="joh.htm#fnB34"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:14)  This looks at the Word incarnate in humility and weakness; the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">savrx</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">sarx</FONT>) does not carry overtones of sinfulness here as it frequently does in Pauline usage. See also John 3:6.<br>
 <a name="fn35" href="joh.htm#fnB35"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:14)  <i>Grk</i> "and tabernacled."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:14)  The Greek word translated <i>took up residence</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">skhnovw</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">skhnow</FONT>) alludes to the OT tabernacle, where the Shekinah, the visible glory of God's presence, resided. The author is suggesting that this glory can now be seen in Jesus (note the following verse).<i> </i>The verb used here may imply that the Shekinah glory that used be found in the tabernacle has taken up residence in the person of Jesus. Cf. also John 2:19-21. <i>The Word became flesh. </i>This verse constitutes the most concise statement of the incarnation in the New Testament. John 1:1 makes it clear that the <i>Logos</i> was fully God, but 1:14 makes it clear that he was also fully human. A Docetic interpretation is completely ruled out. Here for the first time the <i>Logos</i> of 1:1 is identified as Jesus of Nazareth--the two are one and the same. Thus this is the last time the word <i>logos</i> is used in the Fourth Gospel to refer to the second person of the Trinity. From here on it is Jesus of Nazareth who is the focus of John's Gospel.<br>
 <a name="fn36" href="joh.htm#fnB36"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:14)  <i>Grk</i> "and we saw."<br>
 <a name="fn37" href="joh.htm#fnB37"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:14)  Or "of the unique one." Although this word is often translated "only begotten," such a translation is misleading, since in English it appears to express a metaphysical relationship. The word in Greek was used of an only child (a son [Luke 7:12, 9:38] or a daughter [Luke 8:42]). It was also used of something unique (only one of its kind) such as the mythological Phoenix (1 Clement 25:2). From here it passes easily to a description of Isaac (Heb 11:17 and Josephus, <i>Ant.</i>, 1.13.1 [1.222]) who was not Abraham's <i>only</i> son, but was one-of-a-kind because he was the child of the promise. Thus the word means "one-of-a-kind" and is reserved for Jesus in the Johannine literature of the NT. While all Christians are children of God (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tevkna qeou'</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">tekna qeou</FONT>), Jesus is God's Son in a unique, one-of-a-kind sense. The word is used in this way in all its uses in the Gospel of John (1:14, 1:18, 3:16, and 3:18).<br>

 <a name="fn42" href="joh.htm#fnB42"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:16)  <i>Grk</i> "for from his fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace." The meaning of the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">cavrin ajntiV cavrito"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">carin anti carito"</FONT>) could be: (1) love (grace) under the New Covenant in place of love (grace) under the Sinai Covenant, thus replacement; 2) grace "on top of" grace, thus accumulation; (3) grace corresponding to grace, thus correspondence. The most commonly held view is (2) in one sense or another, and this is probably the best explanation. This sense is supported by a fairly well-known use in Philo, <i>Posterity </i>43 (145). Morna D. Hooker suggested that Exod 33:13 provides the background for this expression: "How therefore, I pray you , if I have found <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">cavri"</FONT> (LXX) in your sight, let me know your ways, that I may know you, so that I may find <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">cavri"</FONT> (LXX) in your sight." Hooker proposed that it is this idea of favor given to one who has already received favor which lies behind 1:16, and this seems very probable as a good explanation of the meaning of the phrase ("The Johannine Prologue and the Messianic Secret," <i>NTS </i>21 [1974/75]: 53).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:16)  Earlier commentators (including Origen and Luther) took the words <i>For we have all received from his fullness one gracious gift after another</i> to be John the Baptist's. Most modern commentators take them as the words of the author.<br>

John 1:17 seems to indicate clearly that the Old Covenant (Sinai) was being contrasted with the New. In Jewish sources the Law was regarded as a gift from God (Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 3.8.10 [3.223]; <i>Pirqe Aboth</i> 1.1; <i>Sifre</i> Deut 31:4 &#167;305). Further information can be found in T. F.

 <a name="fn44" href="joh.htm#fnB44"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:18)  The textual problem <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">monogenhV" qeov"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">monogenh" qeo"</FONT>, "the only God") versus <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJ monogenhV" uiJov"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jo monogenh" Juio"</FONT>, "the only son") is a notoriously difficult one. Only one letter would have differentiated the readings in some MSS, since <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>66, one of the earliest MSS (2nd-3rd<sup> </sup>century), uses the contraction <FONT FACE="GREEK UNCIALS">qMs</FONT><FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">;</FONT> the alternative would have been <FONT FACE="GREEK UNCIALS">uMs</FONT>. The external evidence is difficult to evaluate objectively because it is so evenly split between Alexandrian and Byzantine readings and one's view toward the relative importance of these two texttypes will probably decide one's evaluation of the external evidence. Internally, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uiJov"</FONT> fits the immediate context more readily; <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov"</FONT> is much more difficult, but also explains the origin of the other reading (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uiJov"</FONT>), because it is difficult to see why a scribe who found <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uiJov"</FONT> in the text he was copying would alter it to <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov"</FONT>. On the whole neither reading seriously alters the meaning of the text. But <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov"</FONT> as the older and more difficult reading is preferred. As for translation, it makes the most sense to see the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov"</FONT> as in apposition to <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">monogenhv"</FONT>, and the participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJ w[n</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jo wn</FONT>) as in apposition to <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov"</FONT>, giving in effect three descriptions of Jesus rather than only two. The modern translations which best express this are the NEB (margin) and TEV. Several things should be noted: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">monogenhv"</FONT> alone, without <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uiJov"</FONT>, can mean "only son," "unique son," "unique one," etc. (see 1:14). Furthermore, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov"</FONT> is anarthrous. As such it carries qualitative force much like it does in 1:1c, where <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeoV" h\n oJ lovgo"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">qeo" hn Jo logo"</FONT>) means "the Word was fully God" or "the Word was fully of the essence of deity." Finally, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJ w[n</FONT> occurs in Rev 1:4, 1:8, 4:8, 11:17, and 16:5, but even more significantly in the LXX of Exod 3:14.

 <a name="fn53" href="joh.htm#fnB53"><sup>54</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:19)  "<i>Who are you?</i>"<i> </i>No uniform Jewish expectation of a single eschatological figure existed in the 1st century. A majority expected the Messiah. But some pseudepigraphic books describe God's intervention without mentioning the anointed Davidic king; in parts of <i>1 Enoch</i>, for example, the figure of the Son of Man, not the Messiah, embodies the expectations of the author. Essenes at Qumran seem to have expected three figures: a prophet, a priestly messiah, and a royal messiah. In baptizing, John the Baptist was performing an eschatological action. It also seems to have been part of his proclamation (John 1:23, 26-27). Crowds were beginning to follow him. He was operating in an area not too far from the Essene center on the Dead Sea. No wonder the authorities were curious about who he was.<br>
 <a name="fn54" href="joh.htm#fnB54"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:20)  Or "the Messiah" (Both Greek "Christ" and Hebrew and Aramaic "Messiah" mean "one who has been anointed").<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:20)  "<i>I am not the Christ.</i>" A 3rd century work, the pseudo-Clementine <i>Recognitions </i>(1.54 and 1.60 in the Latin text; the statement is not as clear in the Syriac version) records that John's followers proclaimed him to be the Messiah. There is no clear evidence that they did so in the 1st<sup> </sup>century, however--but Luke 3:15 indicates some wondered. Concerning the <i>Christ</i>, the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">cristov"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">cristos</FONT>) was originally an adjective ("anointed"), developing in LXX into a substantive ("an anointed one"), then developing still further into a technical generic term ("the anointed one"). In the intertestamental period it developed further into a technical term referring to the hoped-for anointed one, that is, a specific individual. In the NT the development starts there (technical-specific), is so used in the gospels, and then develops in Paul to mean virtually Jesus' last name.<br>
 <a name="fn55" href="joh.htm#fnB55"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:21)  <i>Grk</i> "What then?" (an idiom).<br>
 <a name="fn56" href="joh.htm#fnB56"><sup>57</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:21)  According to the 1st century rabbinic interpretation of 2 Kgs 2:11, <i>Elijah</i> was still alive. In Mal 4:5 it is said that Elijah would be the precursor of Messiah. How does one reconcile John the Baptist's denial here (<i>"I am not"</i>) with Jesus' statements in Matt 11:14 (see also Mark 9:13 and Matt 17:12) that John the Baptist <i>was</i> Elijah? Some have attempted to remove the difficulty by a reconstruction of the text in the Gospel of John which makes the Baptist say that he was Elijah. However, external support for such emendations is lacking. According to Gregory the Great, John was <i>not</i> Elijah, but exercised toward Jesus the <i>function</i> of Elijah by preparing his way. But this avoids the real difficulty, since in John's Gospel the question of the Jewish authorities to the Baptist concerns <i>precisely</i> his function. It has also been suggested that the author of the Gospel here preserves a historically correct reminiscence--that John the Baptist did not think of himself as Elijah, although Jesus said otherwise. Mark 6:14-16 and Mark 8:28 indicate the people and Herod both distinguished between John and Elijah--<i>probably</i> because he did not see himself as Elijah. But Jesus' remarks in Matt 11:14, Mark 9:13, and Matt 17:12 indicate that John <i>did</i> perform the function of Elijah--John did for Jesus what Elijah was to have done for the coming of the Lord. C. F. D. Moule pointed out that it is too simple to see a straight contradiction between John's account and that of the synoptic gospels: "We have to ask <i>by whom</i> the identification is made, and by whom refused. The synoptic gospels represent <i>Jesus</i> as identifying, or comparing, the Baptist with Elijah, while John represents the <i>Baptist</i> as rejecting the identification when it is offered him by his interviewers. Now these two, so far from being incompatible, are psychologically complementary. The Baptist humbly rejects the exalted title, but Jesus, on the contrary, bestows it on him. Why should not the two both be correct?" (<i>The Phenomenon of the New Testament</i>, 70).<br>

The general significance of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mevnw </FONT>for John is to express the permanency of relationship between Father and Son and Son and believer. Here the use of the word implies that Jesus permanently possesses the Holy Spirit, and because he does, he will dispense the Holy Spirit to others in baptism. Other notes on the dispensation of the Spirit occur at John 3:5 and following (at least implied by the wordplay), John 3:34, 7:38-39, numerous passages in John 14-16 (the Paraclete passages) and John 20:22.

 <a name="fn81" href="joh.htm#fnB81"><sup>82</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:34)  There is a discrepancy as to what the original text of John read here. The debate has to do with what John the Baptist declared about Jesus on this occasion. Did he say, "This is the Son of God" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ou|tov" ejstin oJ uiJoV" tou' qeou'</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">|outo" estin Jo Juio" tou qeou</FONT>), or "This is the Chosen One of God" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ou|tov" ejstin oJ ejklektoV" tou' qeou'</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">outo" estin Jo eklekto" tou qeou</FONT>)? The majority of the witnesses, impressive because of their diversity in age and locales, read "This is the Son of God" (so <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>66 <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>75 B C L bo<sup> </sup>aur c f l g <i>et plu</i>). Most scholars take this to be sufficient evidence that they regard the issue as settled without much of a need to reflect on internal evidence. On the other hand, the earliest MS for this verse, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>5 (3rd century), evidently read <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ou|tov" ejstin oJ ejklektoV" tou' qeou'</FONT>. (There is a gap in the MS at the point of the disputed words; it is too large for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uiJov"</FONT> especially if written, as it surely would have been, as a <i>nomen sacrum</i> [<FONT FACE="GREEK UNCIALS">uMs</FONT>]. The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejklektov"</FONT> was not a <i>nomen sacrum</i> and would have therefore taken up much more space [<FONT FACE="GREEK UNCIALS">eklektos</FONT>]. Given these two variants, there is hardly any question as to what <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>5 read.) This papyrus has many affinities with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT>*, which here also has <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJ ejklektov"</FONT>. In addition to their combined testimony b e ff<sup>2</sup>* syr<sup>s,c </sup><i>et alii</i> also support this reading. A third reading combines these two: "the elect Son" (<i>electus filius</i> in ff<sup>2c</sup> sa and a [with slight variation]). Although the evidence for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejklektov"</FONT> is not nearly as impressive as that for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uiJov"</FONT>, the reading is found in early Alexandrian and Western witnesses. Turning to the internal evidence, "the Chosen One" clearly comes out ahead. "Son of God" is a favorite expression of the author (cf. 1:49; 3:18; 5:25; 10:36; 11:4, 27; 19:7; 20:31); further, there are several other references to "his Son," "the Son," etc. Scribes would be naturally motivated to change <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejklektov"</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uiJov"</FONT> since the latter is both a Johannine expression and is, on the surface, richer theologically in 1:34. On the other hand, there is not a sufficient reason for scribes to change <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uiJov"</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejklektov"</FONT>. The term never occurs in John; even its verbal cognate (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejklevgw</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">eklegw</FONT>) is never affirmed of Jesus in this Gospel. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejklektov"</FONT> clearly best explains the rise of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uiJov"</FONT>. Further, the third reading ("Chosen Son of God") is patently a conflation of the other two. It has all the earmarks of adding <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uiJov"</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejklektov"</FONT>. Thus, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJ</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uiJov" tou' qeou' </FONT>is almost certainly a motivated reading. As R. E. Brown notes (<i>John </i>[AB], 1:57), "On the basis of theological tendency...it is difficult to imagine that Christian scribes would change `the Son of God' to `God's chosen one,' while a change in the opposite direction would be quite plausible. Harmonization with the Synoptic accounts of the baptism (`You are [This is] my beloved <i>Son</i>') would also explain the introduction of `the Son of God' into John; the same phenomenon occurs in vi 69. Despite the weaker textual evidence, therefore, it seems best--with Lagrange, Barrett, Boismard, and others--to accept `God's chosen one' as original." <br>

But later in the Gospel's Passover account (John 19:42, where the sixth hour is on the "eve of the Passover") it seems clear the author had to be using Jewish reckoning, which began at 6 a.m. This would make the time here in 1:39 to be 4 p.m. This may be significant: if the hour was late, Andrew and the unnamed disciple probably spent the night in the same house where Jesus was staying, and the events of 1:41-42 took place on the next day. The evidence for Westcott's view, that the Gospel is using Roman time, is very slim. The Roman reckoning which started at midnight was only used by authorities as legal time (for contracts, official documents, etc.). Otherwise, the Romans too reckoned time from 6 a.m. (e.g., Roman sundials are marked VI, not XII, for noon).<br>

However, there were a number of different messianic expectations in 1st century Palestine (see the note on <i>"Who are you?" </i>in v. 19), and it would be wrong to assume that what Andrew meant here is the same thing the author means in the purpose statement at the end of the Fourth Gospel, 20:31. The issue here is not whether the disciples' initial faith in Jesus as Messiah was genuine or not, but whether their concept of who Jesus was grew and developed progressively as they spent time following him, until finally after his resurrection it is affirmed in the climactic statement of John's Gospel, the affirmation of Thomas in 20:28. <br>

 <a name="fn120" href="joh.htm#fnB120"><sup>121</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:51)  The title <i>Son of Man</i> appears 13 times in John's Gospel. It is associated especially with the themes of crucifixion (3:14; 8:28), revelation (6:27; 6:53), and eschatological authority (5:27; 9:39). The title as used in John's Gospel has for its background the son of man figure who appears in Dan 7:13-14 and is granted universal regal authority. Thus for the author, the emphasis in this title is not on Jesus' humanity, but on his heavenly origin and divine authority.<br>
 <a name="fn121" href="joh.htm#fnB121"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:1)  <i>Cana in Galilee</i> was not a very well-known place. It is mentioned only here, in 4:46, and 21:2, and nowhere else in the NT. Josephus (<i>Life </i>16 [86]) says he once had his quarters there. The probable location is present day Khirbet Cana, 8 mi (14 km) north of Nazareth, or Khirbet Kenna, 4 mi (7 km) northeast of Nazareth.<br>

The attitude of Mary in approaching Jesus and asking him to do something when the wine ran out also suggests that familial obligations were involved.<br>
 <a name="fn124" href="joh.htm#fnB124"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:3)  The word "left" is not in the Greek text but is implied.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (20:30)  <i>They have no wine left. </i>On the backgrounds of this miracle J. D. M. Derrett pointed out among other things the strong element of reciprocity about weddings in the Ancient Near East. It was possible in certain circumstances to take legal action against the man who failed to provide an appropriate wedding gift. The bridegroom and family here might have been involved in a financial liability for failing to provide adequately for their guests ("Water into Wine," <i>BZ</i> 7 <sup>55</sup>: 80-97). Was Mary asking for a miracle? There is no evidence that Jesus had worked any miracles prior to this (although this is an argument from silence). Some think Mary was only reporting the situation, or (as Calvin thought) asking Jesus to give some godly exhortations to the guests and thus relieve the bridegroom's embarrassment. But the words, and the reply of Jesus in v. 4, seem to imply more. It is not inconceivable that Mary, who had probably been witness to the events of the preceding days, or at least was aware of them, knew that her son's public career was beginning. She also knew the supernatural events surrounding his birth, and the prophetic words of the angel, and of Simeon and Anna in the temple at Jesus' dedication. In short, she had good reason to believe Jesus to be the Messiah, and now his public ministry had begun. In this kind of context, her request does seem more significant.<br>
 <a name="fn125" href="joh.htm#fnB125"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  <i>Grk</i> "and Jesus said to her."<br>
 <a name="fn126" href="joh.htm#fnB126"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:4)  The term <i>Woman</i> is Jesus' normal, polite way of addressing women (Matt 15:28, Luke 13:12; John 4:21; 8:10; 19:26; 20:15). But it <i>is</i> unusual for a son to address his mother with this term. The custom in both Hebrew (or Aramaic) and Greek would be for a son to use a qualifying adjective or title. Is there significance in Jesus' use here? It probably indicates that a new relationship existed between Jesus and his mother once he had embarked on his public ministry. He was no longer or primarily only her son, but the "Son of Man." This is also suggested by the use of the same term in 19:26 in the scene at the cross, where the beloved disciple is "given" to Mary as her "new" son.<br>
 <a name="fn127" href="joh.htm#fnB127"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  <i>Grk</i> "Woman, what to me and to you?" (an idiom). The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tiv ejmoiVV kaiV soiv, guvnai</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ti emoi kai soi, gunai</FONT>) is Semitic in origin. The equivalent Hebrew expression in the Old Testament had two basic meanings: (1) When one person was unjustly bothering another, the injured party could say "What to me and to you?" meaning, "What have I done to you that you should do this to me?" (Judg 11:12, 2 Chr 35:21, 1 Kgs 17:18). (2) When someone was asked to get involved in a matter he felt was no business of his, he could say to the one asking him, "What to me and to you?" meaning, "That is your business, how am I involved?" (2 Kgs 3:13, Hos 14:8). Option (1) implies hostility, while option (2) implies merely disengagement. Mere disengagement is almost certainly to be understood here as better fitting the context (although some of the Greek Fathers took the remark as a rebuke to Mary, such a rebuke is unlikely).<br>
 <a name="fn128" href="joh.htm#fnB128"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  <i>Grk</i> "my hour" (referring to the time of Jesus' crucifixion and return to the Father).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:4)  The Greek word translated <i>time</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">w{ra</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jwra</FONT>) occurs in John 2:4; 4:21, 23; 5:25, 28, 29; 7:30; 8:20; 12:23, 27; 13:1; 16:25; and 17:1. It is a reference to the special period in Jesus' life when he was to leave this world and return to the Father (13:1); the hour when the Son of man is glorified (17:1). This is accomplished through his suffering, death, resurrection (and ascension--though this last is not emphasized by John). John 7:30 and 8:20 imply that Jesus' arrest and death are included. John 12:23 and 17:1, referring to the glorification of the Son, imply that the resurrection and ascension are included as part of the "hour." In John 2:4 Jesus' remark to his mother indicates that the time for this self-manifestation has not yet arrived; his identity as Messiah is not yet to be publicly revealed.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (2:6)  Significantly, these jars held water for <i>Jewish ceremonial washing</i> (purification rituals). The water of Jewish ritual purification has become the wine of the new messianic age. The wine may also be, after the fashion of Johannine double meanings, a reference to the wine of the Lord's Supper. A number have suggested this, but there does not seem to be anything in the immediate context which compels this; it seems more related to how frequently a given interpreter sees references to the sacraments in John's Gospel as a whole.<br>

 <a name="fn142" href="joh.htm#fnB142"><sup>22</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:12)  Verse 12 is merely a transitional note in the narrative (although <i>Capernaum</i> does not lie on the direct route to Jerusalem from Cana). Nothing is mentioned in John's Gospel at this point about anything Jesus said or did there (although later his teaching is mentioned, see 6:59). From the synoptics it is clear that Capernaum was a center of Jesus' Galilean ministry and might even be called "his own town" (Matt 9:1). The royal official whose son Jesus healed (John 4:46-54) was from Capernaum. He may have heard Jesus speak there, or picked up the story about the miracle at Cana from one of Jesus' disciples.<br>
 <a name="fn143" href="joh.htm#fnB143"><sup>23</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:12)  With respect to Jesus' <i>brothers</i>, the so-called Helvidian view is to be preferred (named after Helvidius, a 4th century theologian). This view holds that the most natural way to understand the phrase is as a reference to children of Joseph and Mary after the birth of Jesus. Other views are that of Epiphanius (they were children of Joseph by a former marriage) or Jerome (they were cousins). The tradition of Mary's perpetual virginity appeared in the 2nd century and is difficult to explain (as J. H. Bernard, <i>St. John</i> [ICC],<i> </i>1:85, points out) if some of her other children were prominent members of the early church (e.g., James of Jerusalem). But this is outweighed by the natural sense of the words.<br>
 <a name="fn144" href="joh.htm#fnB144"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:13)  <i>Grk</i> "the Passover of the Jews." This is first of at least three (and possibly four) Passovers mentioned in John's Gospel. If it is assumed that the Passovers appear in the Gospel in their chronological order (and following a date of A.D. 33 for the crucifixion), this would be the Passover of the spring of A.D. 30, the first of Jesus' public ministry. There is a clear reference to another Passover in 6:4, and another still in 11:55, 12:1, 13:1, 18:28, 39, and 19:14. The latter would be the Passover of A.D. 33. There is a possibility that 5:1 also refers to a Passover, in which case it would be the second of Jesus' public ministry (A.D. 31), while 6:4 would refer to the third (A.D. 32) and the remaining references would refer to the final Passover at the time of the crucifixion. It is entirely possible, however, that the Passovers occurring in the Fourth Gospel are not intended to be understood as listed in chronological sequence. If the material of the Fourth Gospel originally existed in the form of homilies or sermons by the Apostle John on the life and ministry of Jesus, the present arrangement would not have to be in strict chronological order (it does not explicitly claim to be). In this case the Passover mentioned in 2:13, for example, might actually be later in Jesus' public ministry than it might at first glance appear. This leads, however, to a discussion of an even greater problem in the passage, the relationship of the temple cleansing in John's Gospel to the similar account in the synoptic gospels.<br>
 <a name="fn145" href="joh.htm#fnB145"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:14)  <i>John 2:14-22. </i>Does John's account of the temple cleansing describe the same event as the synoptic gospels describe, or a separate event? The other accounts of the cleansing of the temple are Matt 21:12-13; Mark 11:15-17; and Luke 19:45-46. None are as long as the Johannine account. The fullest of the synoptic accounts is Mark's. John's account differs from Mark's in the mention of sheep and oxen, the mention of the whip of cords, the Greek word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kermatisth'"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kermatisths</FONT>) for <i>money changer</i> (the synoptics use <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kollubisth'"</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kollubisths</FONT>], which John mentions in 2:15), the scattering of the <i>coins</i> (2:15), and the command by Jesus, <i>"Take these things away from here!"</i> The word for <i>overturned</i> in John is <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajnastrefw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">anastrefw</FONT>), while Matthew and Mark use <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">katastrefw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">katastrefw</FONT>; Luke does not mention the moneychangers at all). The synoptics all mention that Jesus quoted Isa 56:7 followed by Jer 7:11. John mentions no citation of scripture at all, but says that later the disciples remembered Ps 69:9. John does not mention, as does Mark, Jesus' prohibition on carrying things through the temple (i.e., using it for a shortcut). But the most important difference is one of time: In John the cleansing appears as the first great public act of Jesus' ministry, while in the synoptics it is virtually the last. The most common solution of the problem, which has been endlessly discussed among NT scholars, is to say there was only one cleansing, and that it took place, as the synoptics record it, at the end of Jesus' ministry. In the synoptics it appears to be the event that finalized the opposition of the high priest, and precipitated the arrest of Jesus. According to this view, John's placing of the event at the opening of Jesus' ministry is due to his general approach; it was fitting `theologically' for Jesus to open his ministry this way, so this is the way John records it. Some have overstated the case for one cleansing and John's placing of it at the opening of Jesus' public ministry, however. For example William Barclay stated: "John, as someone has said, is more interested in the truth than in the facts. He was not interested to tell men when Jesus cleansed the Temple; he was supremely interested in telling men that Jesus did cleanse the Temple" (<i>John, </i>94). But this is not the impression one gets by a reading of John's Gospel: he seems to go out of his way to give details and facts, including notes of time and place. To argue as Barclay does that John is interested in truth apart from the facts is to set up a false dichotomy. Why should one have to assume, in any case, that there could have been only one cleansing of the temple? This account in John is found in a large section of nonsynoptic material. Apart from the work of John the Baptist--and even this is markedly different from the references in the synoptics--nothing else in the first five chapters of John's Gospel is found in <i>any</i> of the synoptics. It is certainly not impossible that John took one isolated episode from the conclusion of Jesus' earthly ministry and inserted it into his own narrative in a place which seemed appropriate according to his purposes. But in view of the differences between John and the synoptics, in both wording and content, as well as setting and time, it is at least possible that the event in question actually occurred twice (unless one begins with the presupposition that the Fourth Gospel is non-historical anyway). In support of two separate cleansings of the temple, it has been suggested that Jesus' actions on this occasion were not permanent in their result, and after (probably) 3 years the <i>status quo</i> in the temple courts had returned to normal. And at this time early in Jesus' ministry, he was virtually unknown. Such an action as he took on this occasion would have created a stir, and evoked the response John records in 2:18-22, but that is probably about all, especially if Jesus' actions met with approval among part of the populace. But later in Jesus' ministry, when he was well-known, and vigorously opposed by the high-priestly party in Jerusalem, his actions might have brought forth another, harsher response. It thus appears possible to argue for two separate cleansings of the temple as well as a single one relocated by John to suit his own purposes. Which then is more probable? On the whole, more has been made of the differences between John's account and the synoptic accounts than perhaps should have been. After all, the synoptic accounts also differ considerably from one another, yet few scholars would be willing to posit four cleansings of the temple as an explanation for this. While it is certainly possible that the author did not intend by his positioning of the temple cleansing to correct the synoptics' timing of the event, but to highlight its significance for the course of Jesus' ministry, it still appears somewhat more probable that John has placed the event he records in the approximate period of Jesus' public ministry in which it did occur, that is, within the first year or so of Jesus' public ministry. The statement of the Jewish authorities recorded by the author (<i>this temple has been under construction for forty-six years</i>) would tend to support an earlier rather than a later date for the temple cleansing described by John, since 46 years from the beginning of construction on Herod's temple in c. 19 B.C. (the date varies somewhat in different sources) would be around A.D. 27. This is not conclusive proof, however.<br>

Some, however, see the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">naov"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">naos</FONT>) here as referring only to the sanctuary and the aorist verb as consummative, so that the meaning would be "this temple was built forty-six years ago" (so D.

Thus, Jesus not only was referring to his <i>physical</i> resurrection, but also to his <i>participation</i> in the resurrection process. The New Testament thus records the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as all performing the miracle of Christ's resurrection.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:21)  <i>Jesus was speaking about the temple of his body. </i>For the author, the temple is not just the building, it is Jesus' resurrected <i>body</i>. Compare the non-localized worship mentioned in John 4:21-23, and also Rev 21:22 (there is to be no temple in the New Jerusalem; the Lord and the Lamb are its temple). John points to the fact that, as the place where men go in order to meet God, the temple has been supplanted and replaced by Jesus himself, in whose resurrected person people may now encounter God (see John 1:18, 14:6).<br>

Out of the darkness of his life and religiosity Nicodemus came to the Light of the world. The author probably had multiple meanings or associations in mind here, as is often the case.<br>

C. Hodges ("Water and Spirit: John 3:5" <i>BSac </i>135 [1978]: 206-20). The word may mean either "again" (in which case it is synonymous with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">palivn</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">palin</FONT>]) or "from above" (BAGD 77 s.v.<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek"> a[nwqen</FONT>). This is a favorite technique of the author of the Fourth Gospel, and it is lost in almost all translations at this point. John uses the word 5 times, in 3:3, 7; 3:31; 19:11 and 23. In the latter 3 cases the context makes clear that it means "from above." Here (3:3, 7) it could mean either, but Hodges is right that the primary meaning intended by Jesus is "from above." Nicodemus apparently understood it the other way, which explains his reply, "How can a man be born when he is old? He can't enter his mother's womb a second time and be born, can he?" The author uses the technique of the "misunderstood question" often to bring out a particularly important point: Jesus says something which is misunderstood by the disciples or (as here) someone else, which then gives Jesus the opportunity to explain more fully and in more detail what he really meant.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:3)  Or<i> born again.</i> The Greek word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">a[nwqen</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">anwqen</FONT>) can mean both "again" and "from above," giving rise to Nicodemus' misunderstanding about a second physical birth (v. 4).<br>
 <a name="fn179" href="joh.htm#fnB179"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:3)  What does Jesus' statement about not being able to <i>see the kingdom of God</i> mean within the framework of John's Gospel? John uses the word <i>kingdom</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">basileiva</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">basileia</FONT>) only 5 times (3:3, 5; 18:36 [3x]). Only here is it qualified with the phrase <i>of God</i>. The fact that John does not stress the concept of the <i>kingdom of God</i> does not mean it is absent from his theology, however. Remember the messianic implications found in John 2, both the wedding and miracle at Cana and the cleansing of the temple. For Nicodemus, the term must surely have brought to mind the messianic kingdom which Messiah was supposed to bring. But Nicodemus had missed <i>precisely</i> this point about <i>who</i> Jesus was. It was the Messiah himself with whom Nicodemus was speaking. Whatever Nicodemus understood, it is clear that the point is this: he misunderstood Jesus' words. He over-literalized them, and thought Jesus was talking about repeated physical birth, when he was in fact referring to new spiritual birth.<br>

Jesus' somewhat enigmatic statement points to the necessity of being born "from above," because <i>water</i> and <i>wind/spirit/Spirit</i> come from above. Isaiah 44:3-5 and Ezek 37:9-10 are pertinent examples of <i>water</i> and <i>wind</i> as life-giving symbols of the Spirit of God in his work among people. Both occur in contexts that deal with the future restoration of Israel as a nation prior to the establishment of the messianic kingdom. It is therefore particularly appropriate that Jesus should introduce them in a conversation about entering the kingdom of God. Note that the Greek word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pneuvmato"</FONT> is anarthrous (has no article) in v. 5. This does not mean that <i>spirit</i> in the verse should be read as a <i>direct</i> reference to the Holy Spirit, but that both water and wind are figures (based on passages in the OT, which Nicodemus, <i>the teacher of Israel</i> should have known) that represent the regenerating work of the Spirit in the lives of men and women.<br>

For John the "flesh" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">savrx</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">sarx</FONT>) emphasizes merely the weakness and mortality of the creature--a neutral term, not necessarily sinful as in Paul. This is confirmed by the reference in John 1:14 to the <i>Logos</i> becoming "flesh." The author avoids associating sinfulness with the incarnate Christ.<br>

It is clear that at this time he has still not grasped what Jesus is saying. Note also that this is the last appearance of Nicodemus in the dialogue. Having served the purpose of the author, at this point he disappears from the scene. As a character in the narrative, he has served to illustrate the prevailing Jewish misunderstanding of Jesus' teaching about the necessity of a new, spiritual birth from above.

What are <i>earthly things</i> which Jesus has just spoken to Nicodemus? And through him to others--this is not the first instance of the plural pronoun, see v. 7, <i>you must all</i>. Since Nicodemus began with a plural (<i>we know</i>, v. 2) Jesus continues it, and through Nicodemus addresses a broader audience. It makes most sense to take this as a reference to the things Jesus has just said (and the things he is about to say, vv. 13-15). If this is the case (and it seems the most natural explanation) then <i>earthly things</i> are not necessarily strictly <i>physical</i> things, but are so called because they take place on earth, in contrast to things like v. 16, which take place in heaven. Some have added the suggestion that the things are called <i>earthly</i> because physical analogies (birth, wind, water) are used to describe them. This is possible, but it seems more probable that Jesus calls these things <i>earthly</i> because they happen on earth (even though they are spiritual things). In the context, taking <i>earthly things</i> as referring to the words Jesus has just spoken fits with the fact that Nicodemus did not believe. And he would not after hearing <i>heavenly things</i> either, unless he first believed in the <i>earthly things</i>--which included the necessity of a regenerating work from above, by the Holy Spirit.<br>

 <a name="fn199" href="joh.htm#fnB199"><sup>29</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:13)  The verb <i>ascended</i> is a perfect tense in Greek (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajnabevbhken</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">anabebhken</FONT>) which seems to look at a past, completed event. (This is not as much of a problem for those who take Jesus' words to end at v. 12, and these words to be a comment by the author, looking back on Jesus' ascension.) As a saying of Jesus, these words are a bit harder to explain. Note, however, the lexical similarities with 1:51: "ascending," "descending," and "son of man." Here, though, the ascent and descent is accomplished by the Son himself, not the angels as in 1:51. There is no need to limit this saying to Jesus' ascent following the resurrection, however; the point of the Jacob story (Gen 28), which seems to be the background for 1:51, is the freedom of communication and relationship between God and men (a major theme of John's Gospel). This communication comes through the angels in Gen 28 (and John 1:51); but here (most appropriately) it comes directly through <i>the Son of Man</i>. Although Jesus could be referring to a prior ascent, after an appearance as the pre-incarnate Son of Man, more likely he is simply pointing out that no one from earth has ever gone up to heaven and come down again. The Son, who has come down from heaven, is the only one who has been `up' there. In both Jewish intertestamental literature and later rabbinic accounts, Moses is portrayed as ascending to heaven to receive the Torah and descending to distribute it to men (e.g., <i>Targum</i> Ps 68:19.) In contrast to these Jewish legends, the Son is the only one who has ever made the ascent and descent.<br>

In John, being <i>lifted up</i> refers to one continuous action of ascent, beginning with the cross but ending at the right hand of the Father.

The Greek adverb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ou{tw"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joutws</FONT>) can refer (1) to the <i>degree </i>to which God loved the world, that is, to such an <i>extent</i> or <i>so much </i>that he gave his own Son (see R. E. Brown, <i>John </i>[AB], 1:133-34; D. A. Carson, <i>John</i>, 204) or (2) simply to the <i>manner </i>in which God loved the world, i.e., by sending his own son (see R. H. Gundry and R. W. Howell, "The Sense and Syntax of John 3:14-17 with Special Reference to the Use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Ou{tw"</FONT>...<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">w{ste</FONT> in John 3:16," NovT 41 [1999]: 24-39)<b>. </b>Though the term more frequently refers to the manner in which something is done (see BAGD 597-98 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ou{tw"</FONT>), the following clause involving <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">w{ste</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jwste</FONT>) plus the indicative (which stresses actual, but [usually] unexpected result) emphasizes the greatness of the gift God has given. With this in mind, then, it is likely (3) that John is emphasizing both the <i>degree </i>to which God loved the world as well as the <i>manner</i> in which He chose to express that love. This is in keeping with John's style of using double entendre or double meaning. Thus, the focus of the Greek construction here is on the <i>nature</i> of God's love, addressing its mode, intensity, and extent.<br>
 <a name="fn207" href="joh.htm#fnB207"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:16)  Although this word is often translated "only begotten," such a translation is misleading, since in English it appears to express a metaphysical relationship. The word in Greek was used of an only child (a son [Luke 7:12, 9:38] or a daughter [Luke 8:42]). It was also used of something unique (only one of its kind) such as the mythological Phoenix (1 Clement 25:2). From here it passes easily to a description of Isaac (Heb 11:17 and Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 1.13.1 [1.222]) who was not Abraham's <i>only</i> son, but was one-of-a-kind because he was the child of the promise. Thus the word means "one-of-a-kind" and is reserved for Jesus in the Johannine literature of the NT. While all Christians are children of God (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tevkna qeou'</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">tekna qeou</FONT>), Jesus is God's Son in a unique, one-of-a-kind sense. The word is used in this way in all its uses in the Gospel of John (1:14, 1:18, 3:16, and 3:18).<br>

 <a name="fn216" href="joh.htm#fnB216"><sup>46</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:21)  <i>John 3:16-21</i> provides an introduction to the (so-called) "realized" eschatology of the Fourth Gospel: judgment has come; eternal life may be possessed now, in the present life, as well as in the future. The terminology "realized eschatology" was originally coined by E. Haenchen and used by J. Jeremias in discussion with C. H. Dodd, but is now characteristically used to describe Dodd's own formulation. See L. Goppelt, <i>Theology of the New Testament</i>, 1:54, note 10, and R. E. Brown (<i>John </i>[AB], 1:cxvii-cxviii) for further discussion. Especially important to note is the element of choice portrayed in John's Gospel. If there is a twofold reaction to Jesus in John's Gospel, it should be emphasized that that reaction is very much dependent on a person's choice, a choice that is influenced by his way of life, whether his deeds are wicked or are done in God (John 3:20-21). For John there is virtually no trace of determinism at the surface. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one find statements like "no one can come to me, unless the Father who sent me draws him" (John 6:44).<br>

(3) Thus Samaria has been suggested. 4 miles (6.6 km) east of Shechem is a town called Salim, and 8 miles (13 km) northeast of Salim lies modern Ainun. In the general vicinity are many springs. Because of the meanings of the names (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Aijnwvn</FONT> = "springs" in Aramaic and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Saleivm</FONT> = Salem, "peace") some have attempted to allegorize here that John the Baptist is <i>near</i> salvation.

 <a name="fn223" href="joh.htm#fnB223"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:25)  Or ceremonial cleansing," or "purification."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:25)  What was the controversy <i>concerning ceremonial washing</i>? It is not clear. Some have suggested that it was over the relative merits of the baptism of Jesus and John. But what about the ceremonial nature of the washing? There are so many unanswered questions here that even R. E. Brown (who does not usually resort to dislocations in the text as a solution to difficulties) proposes that this dialogue originally took place immediately after 1:19-34 and before the wedding at Cana. (Why else the puzzled hostility of the disciples over the crowds coming to Jesus?) Also, the synoptics imply John was imprisoned before Jesus began his Galilean ministry. At any rate, there is no reason to rearrange the material here--it occurs in this place for a very good reason. As far as the author is concerned, it serves as a further continuation of the point made to Nicodemus, that is, the necessity of being born "from above" (3:3). Note that John the Baptist describes Jesus as "the one who comes from heaven" in 3:31 (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">a[nwqen </FONT>[<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">anwqen</FONT>], same word as in 3:3). There is another lexical tie to preceding material: <i>ceremonial washing</i> (3:25), the subject of the dispute, calls to mind the six stone jars of water changed to wine at the wedding feast in 2:6, put there for "Jewish ceremonial washing." This section ultimately culminates and concludes ideas begun in chap. 2 and continued in chap. 3. Although the author does not supply details, one scenario would be this: The disciples of John, perplexed after this disagreement with an individual Jew (or with the Jewish authorities), came to John and asked about the fact that Jesus was baptizing and more and more were coming to him. John had been preaching a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sin (see Mark 1:4, Luke 3:3). Possibly what the Jew(s) reported to John's disciples was that Jesus was now setting aside the Jewish purification rituals as unnecessary. To John's disciples this might also be interpreted as: (a) a falling away from Judaism, and (b) a break with John's own teaching. That Jesus could have said this is very evident from many incidents in his ministry in all the gospels. The thrust would be that outward cleansing (that is, observance of purification rituals) was not what made a person clean. A new heart within (that is, being born from above) is what makes a person clean. So John's disciples came to him troubled about an apparent contradiction in doctrine though the explicit problem they mentioned is that Jesus was baptizing and multitudes were coming to him. (Whether Jesus was or was not baptizing really wasn't the issue though, and John the Baptist knew that because he didn't mention it in his reply. In 4:2 the author says that Jesus was not baptizing, but his disciples. That reference would seem to cover this incident as well, and so the disciples of John are just reporting what they have heard, or thought they heard.) The real point at issue is the <i>authority</i> of Jesus to "overturn" the system of ritual purification within Judaism. John replied to this question of the authority of Jesus in 3:27-36. In 3:27-30 he reassured his disciples, reminding them that if more people were coming to Jesus, it did not threaten him at all, because "heaven" had ordained it to be so (v. 27). (After all, some of these very disciples of John had presumably heard him tell the Jewish delegation that he was not the Messiah but was sent before him, mentioned in John 1.) Then John compared himself to the friend of the bridegroom who stands by and yet participates in the bridegroom's joy (v. 29). John was completely content in his own position as forerunner and preparer of the way.<br>

The major problem in these verses concerns the contradiction between the proverb stated by Jesus in v. 44 and the reception of the Galileans in v. 45. Origen solved the problem by referring <i>his own country</i> to Judea (which Jesus had just left) and not Galilee. But this runs counter to the thrust of John's Gospel, which takes pains to identify Jesus with Galilee (cf. 1:46) and does not even mention his Judean birth. R. E. Brown typifies the contemporary approach: he regards v. 44 as an addition by a later redactor who wanted to emphasize Jesus' unsatisfactory reception in Galilee. Neither expedient is necessary, though, if <i>honor</i> is understood in its sense of attributing true worth to someone. The Galileans did welcome him, but their welcome was to prove a superficial response based on what they had seen him do at the feast. There is no indication that the signs they saw brought them to place their faith in Jesus any more than Nicodemus did on the basis of the signs. But a superficial welcome based on enthusiasm for miracles is no real honor at all.<br>

Externally this problem is difficult to decide, but it is probably better to read the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eJorthv</FONT> as anarthrous in agreement with NA27 and UBS4, and thus a reference to a feast other than the Passover. The incidental note in 5:3, that the sick were lying outside in the porticoes of the pool, makes Passover an unlikely time because it fell toward the end of winter and the weather would not have been warm. L. Morris (<i>John </i>[NICNT],<i> </i>299, n. 6) thinks it impossible to identity the feast with certainty.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (5:1)  <i>A Jewish feast. </i>Jews were obligated to go up to Jerusalem for 3 major annual feasts: Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles. If the first is probably ruled out because of the time of year, the last is not as likely because it forms the central setting for chap. 7 (where there are many indications in the context that Tabernacles is the feast in view.) This leaves the feast of Pentecost, which at some point prior to this time in Jewish tradition (as reflected in Jewish intertestamental literature and later post-Christian rabbinic writings) became identified with the giving of the law to Moses on Mount Sinai. Such an association might explain Jesus' reference to Moses in 5:45-46. This is uncertain, however. The only really important fact for the author is that the healing was done on a Sabbath. This is what provoked the controversy with the Jewish authorities recorded in 5:16-47.<br>

This would imply that there is reference to two pools in the context rather than only one. This does not seem necessary (although it is a grammatical possibility). The gender of the words do not help since both are feminine (as is the participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejpilegomevnh</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">epilegomenh</FONT>]). Note however that Brown's suggestion would require a feminine word to be supplied (for the participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejpilegomevnh</FONT> to modify).

 <a name="fn351" href="joh.htm#fnB351"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tc</b> (5:2)  Some MSS read <i>Bethzatha</i>, while a few read <i>Bethsaida</i>. A lot of controversy has surrounded the name of the pool itself: the reading of the Byzantine (or majority) text, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Bhqesdav</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Bhqesda</FONT>), has been virtually discarded in favor of what is thought to be the more primitive <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Bhqzaqav</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Bhqzaqa</FONT>) or <i>Betzetha</i> (Old Latin). The latter is attested by Josephus as the name of a quarter of the city near the northeast corner of the temple area. He reports that the Syrian Legate Cestius burned this suburb in his attack on Jerusalem in October A.D. 68 (<i>J. W.</i> 2.19.4 [2.530]). However, there is some new archeological evidence (published by M. Baillet, J. T. Milik, and R. de Vaux in <i>Les "petites grottes" de Qumran</i>): Copper scroll 3Q15 from Qumran seems to indicate that in the general area of the temple, on the eastern hill of Jerusalem, a treasure was buried in <i>Bet <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">*</FONT>Esdatayin</i>, in the pool at the entrance to the smaller basin. The name of the region or pool itself seems then to have been <i>Bet <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">*</FONT>Esda</i>, "house of the flowing." It appears with the dual ending in the scroll because there were 2 basins. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Bhqesdav</FONT> seems to be an accurate Greek rendition of the name, while Milik suggests <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Bhqzaqav</FONT> is a rendition of the Aramaic intensive plural <i>Bet <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">*</FONT>Esdata</i>. All of this is not entirely certain, but is certainly plausible; if Milik is correct, both the textual variants would refer to the same location, one a Greek rendering of the Hebrew name, the other a Greek rendering of the Aramaic. This would be an unusual instance where two textual traditions which appear to be in conflict would both be correct.<br>

Stairways at the corners permitted descent to the pool.<br>

 <a name="fn354" href="joh.htm#fnB354"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tc</b> (5:3)  The majority of later MSS add the following to <b>5:3</b>: "waiting for the moving of the water. <b>5:4</b> For an angel of the Lord went down and stirred up the water at certain times. Whoever first stepped in after the stirring of the water was healed from whatever disease which he suffered." Few textual scholars today would accept the authenticity of vv. 3b-4, for they are not found in the earliest witnesses (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>66 <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>75 <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> B C* D), they include un-Johannine vocabulary and syntax, several of the MSS that include the verses mark them as spurious (with an asterisk or obelisk), and because there is a great amount of textual diversity among the witnesses that do include the verses. Internally, to include such verses would suggest an inappropriate divine <i>modus operandi</i>: that the angel would heal only the first sick person who gets to the pool is akin to the unbiblical pop theological aphorism, "God helps those who help themselves." However, in support of their inclusion, there is fairly broad geographical support. Further, the text is incomplete without something here to explain v. 7, the reference to the troubling of the water. Most today would say this is what motivated a copyist to add vv. 3b-4; but the text as it would stand without the verses in question is so difficult that it does not seem consistent with Johannine style elsewhere. It would seem, in fact, either obscure or careless to leave this incident unexplained, when elsewhere John goes to such great lengths to add notes and comments to aid readers who might not be familiar with Jewish customs, places, names, etc. It has also been said on the other hand that there was a popular tradition about the stirring of the water by an angel, which the author of the Gospel chose not to include because he regarded it as popular superstition, and therefore left the matter unexplained (there is, in fact, archeological evidence that the bubbling waters were due to an underground spring). It would seem, however, that he could have included the reference while pointing out that it was only legend; but in any case this is sometimes advanced as an argument in favor of the shorter reading. Thus at this point it must be acknowledged that <i>some</i> portion of vv. 3b-4 may be authentic, though certainly not all; but sorting out which exact combination of words is difficult and may be impossible, given the present state of knowledge of the history of the text. The present translation follows the standard critical Greek texts in omitting the verse number, a procedure also followed by a number of other modern translations.<br>

A preliminary understanding can be obtained from John 5:18, noting the Jewish authorities' response and the author's comment. They sought to kill Jesus, because not only was he <i>breaking the Sabbath</i>, but he was also <i>calling God his own Father</i>, thus making himself equal with God. This must be seen in the context of the relation of God to the Sabbath rest. In the commandment (Exod 20:11) it is explained that "In six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth...and rested on the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy." Philo, based on the LXX translation of Exod 20:11, denied outright that God had ever ceased his creative activity. And when Rabban Gamaliel II, R. Joshua, R. Eleazar ben Azariah, and R. Akiba were in Rome, c. A.D. 95, they gave as a rebuttal to sectarian arguments evidence that God might do as he willed in the world without breaking the Sabbath because the entire world was his private residence. So even the rabbis realized that God did not really cease to work on the Sabbath: Divine providence remained active on the Sabbath, otherwise, all nature and life would cease to exist. As regards men, divine activity was visible in two ways: men were born and men died on the Sabbath. Since only God could give life and only God could deal with the fate of the dead in judgment, this meant God was active on the Sabbath. This seems to be the background for Jesus' words in 5:17. He justified his work of healing on the Sabbath by reminding the Jewish authorities that they admitted God worked on the Sabbath. This explains the violence of the reaction. The Sabbath privilege was peculiar to God, and no one was equal to God. In claiming the right to work even as his Father worked, Jesus was claiming a divine prerogative. He was literally making himself equal to God, as 5:18 goes on to state explicitly for the benefit of the reader who might not have made the connection.<br>

The same that the Father does--and the same that the rabbis recognized as legitimate works of God on the Sabbath (see note on <i>working</i> in v. 17). (1) Jesus grants life (just as the Father grants life) on the Sabbath. But as the Father gives physical life on the Sabbath, so the Son grants spiritual life (John 5:21; note the "greater things" mentioned in v. 20). (2) Jesus judges (determines the destiny of people) on the Sabbath, just as the Father judges those who die on the Sabbath, because the Father has granted authority to the Son to judge (John 5:22-23). But this is not all. Not only has this power been granted to Jesus in the present; it will be his in the future as well. In v. 28 there is a reference not to spiritually dead (only) but also physically dead. At their resurrection they respond to the Son as well.<br>

This apparently parallels the use of Isaiah by John to reflect the spiritual blindness of the Jewish leaders (see the quotations from Isaiah in John 9:41 and 12:39-40).<br>

Anyone who is inclined toward a sacramental viewpoint will almost certainly want to take these words as a reference to the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, or the Eucharist, because of the reference to eating and drinking. But this does not automatically follow: by anyone's definition there must be a symbolic element to the eating which Jesus speaks of in the discourse, and once this is admitted, it is better to understand it here, as in the previous references in the passage, to a personal receiving of (or appropriation of) Christ and his work.<br>

This was the big test, and the twelve, with Peter as spokesman, passed with flying colors. The confession here differs considerably from the synoptic accounts (Matt 16:16, Mark 8:29, and Luke 9:20) and concerns directly the disciples' personal loyalty to Jesus, in contrast to those other disciples who had deserted him (John 6:66).<br>

 <a name="fn531" href="joh.htm#fnB531"><sup>111</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:70)  Although most translations render this last phrase as "one of you is <i>a </i>devil," such a translation presupposes that there is more than one devil. This finds roots in the KJV in which the Greek word for demon was often translated "devil." In fact, the KJV never uses the word "demon." (Sixty-two of the 63 NT instances of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">daimovnion</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">daimonion</FONT>] are translated "devil" [in Acts 17:18 the plural is translated "gods"]. This can get confusing in places where the singular "devil" is used: Is Satan or one of the demons in view [cf. Matt 9:33 (demon); 13:39 (devil); 17:18 (demon); Mark 7:26 (demon); Luke 4:2 (devil); etc.]?) Now regarding John 6:70, both the construction in Greek and the technical use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">diavbolo"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">diabolos</FONT>) indicate that the one devil is in view. To object to the translation "the devil" because it thus equates Judas with Satan does not take into consideration that Jesus often spoke figuratively (e.g., "destroy this temple" [John 2:19]; "he [John the Baptist] is Elijah" [Matt 11:14]), even equating Peter with the devil on one occasion (Mark 8:33). According to D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax</i>, 249, "A curious phenomenon has occurred in the English Bible with reference to one particular monadic noun, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">diavbolo"</FONT>. The KJV translates both <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">diavbolo" </FONT>and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">daimovnion</FONT> as `devil.' Thus in the AV translators' minds, `devil' was not a monadic noun. Modern translations have correctly rendered <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">daimovnion</FONT> as `demon' and have, for the most part, recognized that <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">diavbolo"</FONT> is monadic (cf., e.g., 1 Pet 5:8; Rev 20:2). But in John 6:70 modern translations have fallen into the error of the King James translators. The KJV has "one of you is a devil." So does the RSV, NRSV, ASV, NIV, NKJV, and the Jerusalem Bible. Yet there is only one devil. ...The legacy of the KJV still lives on, then, even in places where it ought not."<br>

 <a name="fn542" href="joh.htm#fnB542"><sup>8</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:2)  Since the present verse places these incidents at the <i>feast of Tabernacles</i> (A.D. 29 or 32, depending on whether one dates the crucifixion in A.D. 30 or 33) there would have been a 6-month interval during which no events are recorded. The author is obviously selective in his approach; he is not recording an exhaustive history (as he will later tell the reader in John 21:25). After healing the paralytic on the Sabbath in Jerusalem (John 5:1-47), Jesus withdrew again to Galilee because of mounting opposition. In Galilee the feeding of the 5,000 took place, which marked the end of the Galilean ministry for all practical purposes. John 7:1-9 thus marks Jesus' final departure from Galilee.<br>

Perhaps. But it is also possible to take the words as indicating that if Jesus is going to put forward messianic claims (i.e., through miraculous signs) then he should do so in Jerusalem, not in the remote parts of Galilee. Such an understanding seems to fit better with the following verse. It would also indicate misunderstanding on the part of Jesus' brothers of the true nature of his mission--he did not come as the royal Messiah of Jewish apocalyptic expectation, to be enthroned as king at this time.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (7:35)  Note the Jewish opponents' misunderstanding of Jesus' words, as made clear in vv. 35-36. They didn't realize he spoke of his departure out of the world. This is another example of the author's use of misunderstanding as a literary device to emphasize a point.<br>

Lev 23:36, however, makes it plain that there was an eighth day, though it was mentioned separately from the seven. It is not completely clear whether the seventh or eighth day was the climax of the feast, called here by the author the "last great day of the feast." Since according to the Mishnah (<i>m. Sukkah</i> 4.1) the ceremonies with water and lights did not continue after the seventh day, it seems more probable that this is the day the author mentions.<br>

 <a name="fn635" href="joh.htm#fnB635"><sup>101</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:38)  An alternate way of punctuating the Greek text of vv. 37-38 results in this translation: "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink. The one who believes in me, just as the scripture says, `From within him will flow rivers of living water.'" John 7:37-38 has been the subject of considerable scholarly debate. Certainly Jesus picks up on the <i>literal</i> water used in the ceremony and uses it figuratively. But what does the figure mean? According to popular understanding, it refers to the coming of the Holy Spirit to dwell in the believer. There is some difficulty in locating an OT text which speaks of rivers of water flowing from within such a person, but Isa 58:11 is often suggested: "The LORD will continually lead you, he will feed you even in parched regions. He will give you renewed strength, and you will be like a well-watered garden, like a spring that continually produces water." Other passages which have been suggested are Prov 4:23 and 5:15; Isa 44:3 and 55:1; Ezek 47:1 ff.; Joel 3:18; and Zech 13:1 and 14:8. The meaning in this case is that when anyone comes to believe in Jesus the scriptures referring to the activity of the Holy Spirit in a person's life are fulfilled. "When the believer comes to Christ and drinks he not only slakes his thirst but receives such an abundant supply that veritable rivers flow from him" (L. Morris, <i>John </i>[NICNT], 424-25). In other words, with this view, the believer himself becomes the source of the living water. This is the traditional understanding of the passage, often called the "Eastern interpretation" following Origen, Athanasius, and the Greek Fathers. It is supported by such modern scholars as Barrett, Behm, Bernard, Cadman, Carson, R. H. Lightfoot, Lindars, Michaelis, Morris, Odeberg, Schlatter, Schweizer, C. H. Turner, M. M. B. Turner, Westcott, and Zahn. In addition it is represented by the following Greek texts and translations: KJV, RSV, NASB, UBS4 and NA27. D. A. Carson, <i>John</i>, 322-29, has a thorough discussion of the issues and evidence although he opts for the previous interpretation. There is another interpretation possible, however, called the "Western interpretation" because of patristic support by Justin, Hippolytus, Tertullian, and Irenaeus. Modern scholars who favor this view are Abbott, Beasley-Murray, Bishop, Boismard, Braun, Brown, Bullinger, Bultmann, Burney, Dodd, Dunn, Guilding, R. Harris, Hoskyns, Jeremias, Loisy, D. M. Stanley, Th&uuml;sing, N. Turner, and Zerwick. This view is represented by the translation in the RSV margin and by the NEB. It is also sometimes called the "christological interpretation" because it makes Jesus himself the source of the living water in v. 38, by punctuating as follows: (37b)<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek"> ejavn ti diya'/ ejrcevsqw prov" me, kaiV pinevtw </FONT>(38)<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek"> oJ pisteuvwn eij" ejmev. KaqwV" ei\pen hJ grafhv, potamoiV ejk th'" koiliva" aujtou' rJeuvsousin u{dato" zw'nto".</FONT> Three crucial questions are involved in the solution of this problem: (1) punctuation; (2) determining the antecedent of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aujtou'</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">autou</FONT>); and (3) the source of the scripture quotation. With regard to (1) <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>66 does place a full stop after <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pinevtw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">pinetw</FONT>), but this may be theologically motivated and could have been added later. Grammatical and stylistic arguments are inconclusive. More important is (2) the determination of the antecedent of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aujtou'</FONT>. Can any other Johannine parallels be found which make the believer the source of the living water? John 4:14 is often mentioned in this regard, but unlike 4:14 the water here becomes a source for others also. Neither does 14:12 provide a parallel. Furthermore, such an interpretation becomes even more problematic in light of the explanation given in v. 39 that the water refers to the Holy Spirit, since it is extremely difficult to see the individual believer becoming the `source' of the Spirit for others. On the other hand, the Gospel of John repeatedly places Jesus himself in this role as source of the living water: 4:10, of course, for the water itself; but according to 20:22 Jesus provides the Spirit (cf. 14:16). Furthermore, the symbolism of 19:34 is difficult to explain as anything other than a deliberate allusion to what is predicted here. This also explains why the Spirit cannot come to the disciples unless Jesus "departs" (16:7). As to (3) the source of the scripture quotation, M. E. Boismard has argued that John is using a targumic rendering of Ps 78:15-16 which describes the water brought forth from the rock in the wilderness by Moses ("Les citations targumiques dans le quatri&egrave;me &eacute;vangile," <i>RB</i> 66 [1959]: 374-78). The frequency of Exodus motifs in the Fourth Gospel (paschal lamb, bronze serpent, manna from heaven) leads quite naturally to the supposition that the author is here drawing on the account of Moses striking the rock in the wilderness to bring forth water (Num 20:8 ff.). That such imagery was readily identified with Jesus in the early church is demonstrated by Paul's understanding of the event in 1 Cor 10:4. Jesus is the Rock from which the living water--the Spirit--will flow. Carson (see note above) discusses this imagery although he favors the traditional or "Eastern" interpretation. In summary, the latter or "Western" interpretation is to be preferred.<br>

 <a name="fn670" href="joh.htm#fnB670"><sup>136</sup></a><b>tc</b> (7:52)  At least one early and important MS (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>66) places the Greek article before "prophet," making this a reference to the "prophet like Moses" mentioned in Deut 18:15.<br>
 <b>tn</b> (7:52)  This claim by the leaders presents some difficulty, because Jonah had been from Gathhepher, in Galilee (2 Kgs 14:25). Also the Babylonian Talmud later stated, "There was not a tribe in Israel from which there did not come prophets" (<i>b.</i> <i>Sukkah</i> 27b). Two explanations are possible: (1) In the heat of anger the members of the Sanhedrin overlooked the facts (this is perhaps the easiest explanation). (2) This anarthrous noun is to be understood as a reference to <i>the</i> prophet of Deut 18:15 (note the reading of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>66 which is articular), by this time an eschatological figure in popular belief. This would produce in the text of John's Gospel a high sense of irony indeed, since the religious authorities by their insistence that "the Prophet" could not come from Galilee displayed their true ignorance of where Jesus came from on <i>two</i> levels at once (Bethlehem, his birthplace, the fulfillment of Mic 5:2, but also heaven, from which he was sent by the Father). The author does not even bother to refute the false attestation of Jesus' place of birth as Galilee (presumably Christians knew all too well where Jesus came from).<br>
 <a name="fn671" href="joh.htm#fnB671"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tc</b> (7:53)  This entire section, 7:53-8:11, traditionally known as the <i>pericope adulterae</i>, is not contained in the earliest and best MSS and was almost certainly not an original part of the Gospel of John. Among modern commentators and textual critics, it is a foregone conclusion that the section is not original but represents a later addition to the text of the Gospel. B. M. Metzger summarizes: "the evidence for the non-Johannine origin of the pericope of the adulteress is overwhelming" (<i>Textual Commentary</i>, 187-89). External evidence is as follows: For the omission of 7:53-8:11, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>66 <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>75 <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> B L N T W X Y <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">D</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Q</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Y</FONT> 053 0141 0211 22 33 124 157 209 565 788 828 1230 1241 1242 1253 2193 <i>al</i>. In addition codices A and C are defective in this part of John, but it appears that neither contained the pericope, because careful measurement shows that there would not have been enough space on the missing pages to include the pericope 7:53-8:11 along with the rest of the text. Among the MSS that include 7:53-8:11 are: D F G H K M U <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">G</FONT> 28 700 892 1009 1010 1071 1079 1195 1216 1344 1365 1546 1646 2148 2174 <i>Byz</i> <i>al</i>. In addition E, S, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">L</FONT>, and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">P</FONT> include part or all of the passage with asterisks or obeli, 225 places the pericope after John 7:36, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Euml;</FONT><sup>1</sup> places it after John 21:24 or 25, 115 after John 8:12, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Euml;</FONT><sup>13</sup> after Luke 21:38, and the corrector of 1333 includes it after Luke 24:53. In evaluating this MS evidence, it should be remembered that in the gospels A is usually considered to be of Byzantine texttype (unlike in the Pauline epistles, where it is Alexandrian), as are E, F, and G (MSS with the same designation are of Western texttype in the Pauline epistles). This leaves D as the only major Western uncial witness in the gospels for the inclusion. Therefore the evidence could be summarized by saying that almost all early MSS of the Alexandrian texttype omit the pericope, while most MSS of the Western and Byzantine texttype include it. But it must be remembered that "Western MSS" here refers only to D, a single witness. Thus it can be seen that practically all of the earliest and best MSS extant omit the pericope; it is found only in MSS of secondary importance. But before one can conclude that the passage was not originally part of the Gospel of John, internal evidence needs to be considered as well. Internal evidence in favor of the inclusion of 8:1-11 (7:53-8:11): (1) 7:53 fits in the context. If the "last great day of the feast" (7:37) refers to the conclusion of the Feast of Tabernacles, then the statement refers to the pilgrims and worshipers going home after living in "booths" for the week while visiting Jerusalem. (2) The chief priests and Pharisees had just mocked Nicodemus for suggesting that Jesus' claims might possibly be true. In particular they heaped scorn on Jesus' Galilean origins (7:52). But far more than a prophet was to come from Galilee, according to Isa 9:1-2. In view of John's observed fondness for Isaiah, it seems impossible that he was unaware of this prophecy. But if he was aware of it, he might be expected to work it into the background of the narrative, as he has often done before. And that is exactly what is found: 8:12 is the point when Jesus describes himself as the Light of the world. But the section in question mentions that Jesus returned to the temple at "early dawn" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek"> [Orqrou</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Orqrou</FONT>, in 8:2). This is the "dawning" of the Light of the world (8:12) mentioned by Isa 9:2. (3) Furthermore, note the relationship to what follows: just prior to presenting Jesus' statement that he is the Light of the world, John presents the reader with an example that shows Jesus as the light. Once again, this calls to mind one of the major themes of the Gospel: light and darkness (compare especially 3:19-21). Here the woman "came to the light" (although not at first willingly) while her accusers shrank away into the shadows, because their deeds were evil. This could be seen as an appropriate setting for Jesus to follow with the statement of 8:12, "I am the light of the world." Internal evidence against the inclusion of 8:1-11 (7:53-8:11): (1) In reply to the claim that the introduction to the pericope, 7:53, fits the context, it should also be noted that the narrative reads well without the pericope, so that Jesus' reply in 8:12 is directed against the charge of the Pharisees in 7:52 that no prophet comes from Galilee. (2) The assumption that the author "must" somehow work Isa 9:12 into the narrative is simply that--an assumption. The statement by the Pharisees in 7:52 about Jesus' Galilean origins is allowed to stand without correction by the author, although one might have expected him to mention that Jesus was really born in Bethlehem. And 8:12 does directly mention Jesus' claim to be the Light of the world. The author may well have presumed familiarity with Isa 9:12 on the part of his readers because of its widespread association with Jesus among early Christians. (3) The fact that the pericope deals with the light/darkness motif does not inherently strengthen its claim to authenticity, because the motif is so prominent in the Fourth Gospel that it may well have been the reason why someone felt that the pericope, circulating as an independent tradition, fit so well here. (4) In general the style of the pericope is not Johannine either in vocabulary or grammar. According to R. E. Brown it is closer stylistically to Lucan material (<i>John </i>[AB], 1:336). Interestingly one important family of MSS (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Euml;</FONT><sup>13</sup>) places the pericope after Luke 21:38. Conclusion: In the final analysis, the weight of evidence in this case must go with the external evidence. The earliest and best MSS do not contain the pericope. It is true with regard to internal evidence that an attractive case can be made for inclusion, but this is by nature subjective (as evidenced by the fact that strong arguments can be given against such as well). In terms of internal factors like vocabulary and style, the pericope does not stand up very well. The question may be asked whether this incident, although not an original part of the Gospel of John, should be regarded as an authentic tradition about Jesus. It could well be that it is ancient and may indeed represent an unusual instance where such a tradition survived outside of the bounds of the canonical literature.<br>

 <a name="fn691" href="joh.htm#fnB691"><sup>21</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:12)  The theory proposed by F. J. A. Hort (<i>The New Testament in the Original Greek, </i>vol. 2, <i>Introduction; Appendix</i>, 87-88) that the backdrop of 8:12 is the lighting of the candelabra in the court of women, may offer a plausible setting to the proclamation by Jesus that he is <i>the light of the world</i>. The last time that Jesus spoke in the narrative (assuming 7:53-8:11 is not part of the original text, as the textual evidence suggests) is in 7:38, where he was speaking to a crowd of pilgrims in the temple area. This is where he is found in the present verse, and he may be addressing the crowd again. Jesus' remark has to be seen in view of both the prologue (John 1:4, 5) and the end of the discourse with Nicodemus (John 3:19-21). The coming of Jesus into the world provokes judgment: a choosing up of sides becomes necessary. The one who comes to the light, that is, who follows Jesus, will <i>not</i> walk in the darkness. The one who refuses to come, <i>will</i> walk in the darkness. In this contrast, there are only two alternatives. So it is with a person's decision about Jesus. Furthermore, this serves as in implicit indictment of Jesus' opponents, who still walk in the darkness, because they refuse to come to him. This sets up the contrast in chap. 9 between the man born blind, who receives both physical and spiritual sight, and the Pharisees (John 9:13, 15, 16) who have physical sight but remain in spiritual darkness.<br>

They tried to condemn people. Jesus did not come to judge the world, but to save it (3:17). Nevertheless, and not contradictory to this, the coming of Jesus did bring judgment, because it forced people to make a choice. Would they accept Jesus or reject him? Would they come to the light or shrink back into the darkness? As they responded, so were they judged--just as 3:19-21 previously stated. One's response to Jesus determines one's eternal destiny.<br>

The translation "set you free" or "release you" (unlike the more traditional "make you free") conveys more the idea that the hearers were currently in a state of slavery from which they needed to be freed. The following context supports precisely this idea.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (8:32)  The statement<i> the truth will set you free</i> is often taken as referring to <i>truth</i> in the philosophical (or absolute) sense, or in the intellectual sense, or even (as the Jews apparently took it) in the political sense. In the context of John's Gospel (particularly in light of the prologue) this must refer to <i>truth </i>about the person and work of Jesus. It is saving truth. As L. Morris says, "it is the truth which saves men from the darkness of sin, not that which saves them from the darkness of error (though there is a sense in which men in Christ are delivered from gross error)" (<i>John </i>[NICNT], 457).<br>

Here repeated, continuous action is in view. The one whose lifestyle is characterized by repeated, continuous sin is a slave to sin. That one is not free; sin has enslaved him. To break free from this bondage requires outside (divine) intervention. Although the statement is true at the general level (the person who continually practices a lifestyle of sin is enslaved to sin) the particular sin of the Jewish authorities, repeatedly emphasized in the Fourth Gospel, is the sin of unbelief. The present tense in this instance looks at the continuing refusal on the part of the Jewish leaders to acknowledge who Jesus is, in spite of mounting evidence.<br>

 <a name="fn747" href="joh.htm#fnB747"><sup>77</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:35)  Jesus' point is that while a slave may be part of a family or household, the slave is not guaranteed a permanent place there, while a <i>son</i>, as a descendant or blood relative, will always be guaranteed a place in the family (<i>remains forever</i>).<br>

The use of past tenses would seem to refer to something that occurred during the patriarch's lifetime. <i>Genesis Rabbah</i> 44:25ff, (cf. 59:6) states that Rabbi Akiba, in a debate with Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai, held that Abraham had been shown not this world only but the world to come (this would include the days of the Messiah). More realistically, it is likely that Gen 22:13-15 lies behind Jesus' words. This passage, known to rabbis as the <i>Akedah</i> ("Binding"), tells of Abraham finding the ram which will replace his son Isaac on the altar of sacrifice--an occasion of certain rejoicing.<br>

Although each occurrence of the phrase "I am"<i> </i>in the Fourth Gospel needs to be examined individually in context to see if an association with Exod 3:14 is present, it seems clear that this is the case here (as the response of the Jewish authorities in the following verse shows).<br>

The opening words of chap. 9, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiV paravgwn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai paragwn</FONT>), convey only the vaguest indication of the circumstances. Since there is no break with chap. 8, Jesus is presumably still in Jerusalem, and presumably <i>not</i> still in the temple area. The events of chap. 9 fall somewhere between the feast of Tabernacles (John 7:2) and the feast of the Dedication (John 10:22). But in the author's narrative the connection exists--the incident recorded in chap. 9 (along with the ensuing debates with the Pharisees) serves as a real-life illustration of the claim Jesus made in 8:12, <i>I am the light of the world.</i> This is in fact the probable theological motivation behind the juxtaposition of these two incidents in the narrative. The second serves as an illustration of the first, and as a concrete example of the victory of light over darkness. One other thing which should be pointed out about the miracle recorded in chap. 9 is its messianic significance. In the OT it is God himself who is associated with the giving of sight to the blind (Exod 4:11, Ps 146:8). In a number of passages in Isa (29:18, 35:5, 42:7) it is considered to be a messianic activity.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (9:2)  The disciples assumed that <i>sin</i> (regardless of who committed it) was the cause of the man's blindness. This was a common belief in Judaism; the rabbis used Ezek 18:20 to prove there was no death without sin, and Ps 89:33 to prove there was no punishment without guilt (the Babylonian Talmud, <i>b. Shabbat </i>55a, although later than the NT, illustrates this). Thus in this case the sin must have been on the part of the man's parents, or during his own prenatal existence. <i>Song Rabbah</i> 1:41 (another later rabbinic work) stated that when a pregnant woman worshiped in a heathen temple the unborn child also committed idolatry. This is only one example of how, in rabbinic Jewish thought, an unborn child was capable of sinning.<br>

 <a name="fn842" href="joh.htm#fnB842"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:5)  Jesus' statement <i>I am the light of the world</i> connects the present account with 8:12. Here (seen more clearly than at 8:12) it is obvious what the author sees as the significance of Jesus' statement. "Light" is not a metaphysical definition of the person of Jesus but a description of his effect on the world, forcing everyone in the world to `choose up sides' for or against him (cf. 3:19-21).<br>

The textual variant preserved in the Syriac text of Ephraem's commentary on the <i>Diatessaron</i> ("he made eyes from his clay") probably arose from the interpretation given by Irenaeus in <i>Against Heresies</i>: "that which the Artificer, the Word, had omitted to form in the womb, he then supplied in public." This involves taking the clay as an allusion to Gen 2:7, which is very unlikely.<br>

There is no substantial evidence for a formal ban on Christians until later than this Gospel could possibly have been written. This may be a reference to some form of excommunication adopted as a contingency to deal with those who were proclaiming Jesus to be the Messiah. If so, there is no other record of the procedure than here. It was probably local, limited to the area around Jerusalem. See also the note on <i>synagogue</i> in 6:59.<br>

In the Johannine context the word would connote its full sense: this was something due God alone. Note also that Jesus did not prevent the man from doing this. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">proskunevw </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">proskunew</FONT>) is used in John 4:20-25 of worshiping God, and again with the same sense in 12:20. This would be the only place in John's Gospel where anyone is said to have worshiped Jesus using this term. As such, it forms the climax of the story of the man born blind, but the uniqueness of the concept of worshiping Jesus at this point in John's narrative (which reaches its ultimate climax in the confession of Thomas in John 20:28) may suggest it is too early for such a response and it represents a later scribal addition.<br>

Jesus said," (vv. 38-39a). This is weighty evidence for the omission of these words. It is difficult to overstate the value of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>75 here, since it is the only currently available papyrus MS extant for the text of John 9:38-39. Further, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute; </FONT>is an important and early Alexandrian witness for the omission. The versional testimony and codex W also give strong support to the omission. Nearly all other MSS, however, include these words. The omission may have been occasioned by parablepsis (both verses 37 and 39 begin with "Jesus said to him"), though it is difficult to account for such an error across such a wide variety of witnesses. On the other hand, the longer reading appears to be motivated by liturgical concerns (so R. E. Brown, <i>John </i>[AB], 1:375), since the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">proskunevw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">proskunew</FONT>, "I worship") is used in John 4:20-25 of worshiping God, and again with the same sense in 12:20. If these words were authentic here, this would the only place in John's Gospel where Jesus is the explicit object of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">proskunevw</FONT>. Even if these words are not authentic, such an omission would nevertheless hardly diminish John's high Christology (cf. 1:1; 5:18-23; 14:6-10; 20:28), nor the implicit worship of him by Thomas (20:28). Nevertheless, a decision is difficult, and the included words may reflect a very early tradition about the blind man's response to Jesus. Because of the difficulty of this problem, the words have been retained, but placed in square brackets to indicate a strong degree of doubt as to their inclusion in the original text of John.<br>

But the Pharisees, who claimed to possess spiritual sight, were spiritually blinded. The reader might recall Jesus' words to Nicodemus in 3:10, "Are you the teacher of Israel and don't understand these things?" In other words, to receive Jesus was to receive the light of the world, to reject him was to reject the light, close one's eyes, and become blind. This is the serious sin of which Jesus had warned before (8:21-24). The blindness of such people was incurable since they had rejected the only cure that exists (cf. 12:39-41).<br>

Note the contrast: the thief takes the life of the sheep (10:10), the <i>good shepherd</i> lays down his own <i>life</i> for the sheep. Jesus is not speaking generally here, but specifically: he has his own substitutionary death on the cross in view. For a literal shepherd with a literal flock, the shepherd's death would have spelled disaster for the sheep; in this instance it spells life for them (Compare the worthless shepherd of Zech 11:17, by contrast).<br>

From a historical standpoint, it was the last great deliverance the Jewish people had experienced, and it came at a time when least expected. Josephus ends his account of the institution of the festival with the following statement: "And from that time to the present we observe this festival, which we call the festival of Lights, giving this name to it, I think, from the fact that the right to worship appeared to us at a time when we hardly dared hope for it" (<i>Ant.</i> 12.7.6 [12.325]).<br>

 <a name="fn1030" href="joh.htm#fnB1030"><sup>82</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:34)  A quotation from Ps 82:6.<i> </i>Technically the Psalms are not part of the OT "law" (which usually referred to the five books of Moses), but occasionally the term "law" was applied to the entire OT, as here. The problem in this verse concerns the meaning of Jesus' quotation from Ps 82:6. It is important to look at the OT context: the whole line reads, "I say, you are gods, sons of the Most High, all of you." Jesus will pick up on the term "sons of the Most High" in 10:36, where he refers to himself as the <i>Son of God</i>. The psalm was understood in rabbinic circles as an attack on unjust judges who, though they have been given the title "gods" because of their quasi-divine function of exercising judgment, are just as mortal as other men. What is the argument here? It is often thought to be as follows: if it was an OT practice to refer to men like the judges as gods, and not blasphemy, why did the Jewish authorities object when this term was applied to Jesus? This really doesn't seem to fit the context, however, since if that were the case Jesus would not be making any claim for "divinity" for himself over and above any other human being--and therefore he would not be subject to the charge of blasphemy. Rather, this is evidently a case of arguing from the lesser to the greater, a common form of rabbinic argument. The reason the OT judges could be called gods is because they were vehicles of the word of God (cf. 10:35). But granting that premise, Jesus deserves much more than they to be called God. He is the Word incarnate, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world to save the world (10:36). In light of the prologue to the Gospel of John, it seems this interpretation would have been most natural for the author. If it is permissible to call men "gods" because they were the vehicles of the word of God, how much more permissible is it to use the word "God" of him who is the Word of God?<br>
 <a name="fn1031" href="joh.htm#fnB1031"><sup>83</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:35)  The parenthetical note<i> And the scripture cannot be broken</i> belongs to Jesus' words rather than the author's. Not only does Jesus appeal to the OT to defend himself against the charge of blasphemy, but he also adds that the scripture cannot be "broken." In this context he does not explain precisely what is meant by "broken," but it is not too hard to determine. Jesus' argument depended on the exact word used in the context of Ps 82:6. If any other word for "judge" had been used in the psalm, his argument would have been meaningless. Since the scriptures do use this word in Ps 82:6, the argument is binding, because they cannot be "broken" in the sense of being shown to be in error.<br>

Furthermore, the glorification of the Son is not praise that comes to him for the miracle, but his death, resurrection, and return to the Father which the miracle precipitates (note the response of the Jewish authorities in 11:47-53).<br>

It seems necessary to understand the disciples' belief here in a developmental sense, because there are numerous references to the disciples' faith previous to this in John's Gospel, notably 2:11.

 <b>sn</b> (11:17)  There is no description of the journey itself. The author simply states that when Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had been in the tomb <i>four days already</i>. He had died some time before this but probably not very long (cf. Ananias and Sapphira in Acts 5:6,10 who were buried immediately after they died, as was the common practice of the time). There is some later evidence (early 3rd century) of a rabbinic belief that the soul hovered near the body of the deceased for three days, hoping to be able to return to the body. But on the fourth day it saw the beginning of decomposition and finally departed (<i>Leviticus Rabbah</i> 18.1). If this belief is as old as the 1st century, it might suggest the significance of the four days: after this time, resurrection would be a first-order miracle, an unequivocal demonstration of the power of God. It is not certain if the tradition is this early, but it is suggestive. Certainly the author does not appear to attach any symbolic significance to the four days in the narrative.<br>

However, Martha's statement in 11:39 makes it clear that she had no idea that a resurrection was still possible. How then are her words in 11:22 to be understood? It seems best to take them as a confession of Martha's continuing faith in Jesus even though he was not there in time to help her brother. She means, in effect, "Even though you weren't here in time to help, I still believe that God grants your requests."<br>

 <b>sn</b> (11:23) <i> </i>Jesus' remark to Martha that Lazarus would <i>come back to life again</i> is another example of the misunderstood statement. Martha apparently took it as a customary statement of consolation and joined Jesus in professing belief in the general resurrection of the body at the end of the age. However, as Jesus went on to point out in 11:25-26, Martha's general understanding of the resurrection at the last day was inadequate for the present situation, for the gift of life that conquers death was a present reality to Jesus. This is consistent with the author's perspective on eternal life in the Fourth Gospel: it is not only a future reality, but something to be experienced in the present as well. It is also consistent with the so-called "realized eschatology" of the Fourth Gospel.<br>

In the LXX, the verb and its cognates are used to describe a display of indignation (Dan 11:30, for example--see also Mark 14:5). Jesus displayed this reaction to the afflicted in Mark 1:43, Matt 9:30. Was he angry at the afflicted? No, but he was angry because he found himself face-to-face with the manifestations of Satan's kingdom of evil. Here, the realm of Satan was represented by death.<br>

This word simply means "to shed tears" and has more the idea of quiet grief. But why did Jesus do this? Not out of grief for Lazarus, since he was about to be raised to life again. L. Morris (<i>John </i>[NICNT]<i>, </i>558) thinks it was grief over the misconception of those round about. But it seems that in the context the weeping is triggered by the thought of Lazarus in the tomb: this was not personal grief over the loss of a friend (since Lazarus was about to be restored to life) but grief over the effects of sin, death, and the realm of Satan. It was a natural complement to the previous emotional expression of anger (11:33).

Yet Caiaphas could not suspect that Jesus would die, not in place of the political nation Israel, but on behalf of the true people of God; and he would save them, not from physical destruction, but from eternal destruction (cf. 3:16-17).

As far as the author's account is concerned, Jesus totally ignores these Greeks and makes no further reference to them whatsoever. It appears that his words are addressed to Andrew and Philip, but in fact they must have had a wider audience, including possibly the Greeks who had wished to see him in the first place. The words <i>the time has come </i>recall all the previous references to "the hour" throughout the Fourth Gospel (see the note on <i>time</i> in 2:4).

This will be reiterated in 13:1 and 17:1. Jesus states (employing words similar to those of Ps 6:4) that his soul is troubled. What shall his response to his imminent death be? A prayer to the Father to deliver him from that hour? No, because it is on account of this very hour that Jesus has come.

 <b>sn</b> (12:31)  The phrase<i> driven out</i> must refer to Satan's loss of authority over this world. This must be in principle rather than in immediate fact, since 1 John 5:19 states that the whole world (still) lies in the power of the evil one (a reference to Satan). In an absolute sense the reference is proleptic. The coming of Jesus' hour (his crucifixion, death, resurrection, and exaltation to the Father) marks the end of Satan's domain and brings about his defeat, even though that defeat has not been ultimately worked out in history yet and awaits the consummation of the age.<br>

None of these passages are in the Pentateuch <i>per se</i>, but "law" could in common usage refer to the entire OT (compare Jesus' use in John 10:34). Of the passages mentioned, Ps 89:36-37 is the most likely candidate. This verse speaks of David's "seed" remaining forever. Later in the same psalm, v. 51 speaks of the "anointed" (Messiah), and the psalm was interpreted messianically in both the NT (Acts 13:22, Rev 1:5, 3:14) and in the rabbinic literature (<i>Genesis Rabbah</i> 97).<br>

(2) To those later individuals to whom the Fourth Gospel was written, and to every person since, the words of Jesus are also a warning: there is a finite, limited time in which each individual has opportunity to respond to the Light of the world (i.e., Jesus); after that comes darkness.

On the basis of statements like 1:14 in the prologue, the author probably put no great distinction between the two.

The message for the disciples was that they were to love one another not just in humble, self-effacing service, but were to be willing to die for one another.

This makes a fine illustration from a homiletic standpoint, but is it the meaning of the passage? This seems highly doubtful. Jesus stated that the disciples were <i>completely clean</i> except for Judas (vv. 10b, 11). What they needed was to have their feet washed by Jesus. In the broader context of the Fourth Gospel, the significance of the foot-washing seems to point not just to an example of humble service (as most understand it), but something more--Jesus' self-sacrificial death on the cross. If this is correct, then the foot-washing which they needed to undergo represented their <i>acceptance</i> of this act of self-sacrifice on the part of their master. This makes Peter's initial abhorrence of the act of humiliation by his master all the more significant in context; it also explains Jesus' seemingly harsh reply to Peter (above, v. 8; compare Matt 16:21-23 where Jesus says to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan").<br>

If it is simply an act of humble service, as most interpret the significance, then Jesus is really telling his disciples to serve one another in humility rather than seeking preeminence over one another.

This individual also is mentioned in 19:26, 20:2, 21:7, and 21:20. Some have suggested that this disciple is to be identified with Lazarus, since the Fourth Gospel specifically states that Jesus loved him (11:3, 5, 36). From the terminology alone this is a possibility; the author is certainly capable of using language in this way to indicate connections. But there is nothing else to indicate that Lazarus was present at the last supper; Mark 14:17 seems to indicate it was only the twelve who were with Jesus at this time, and there is no indication in the Fourth Gospel to the contrary. Nor does it appear that Lazarus ever stood so close to Jesus as the later references in chaps. 19, 20 and 21 seem to indicate. When this is coupled with the omission of all references to John son of Zebedee from the Fourth Gospel, it seems far more likely that the references to the beloved disciple should be understood as references to him.<br>

It is entirely possible that Judas was seated to Jesus' left. Matt 26:25 seems to indicate that Jesus could speak to him without being overheard by the rest of the group.

In speaking of love as the <i>new commandment</i> for those whom Jesus had chosen as his own (John 13:1, 15:16) and as a mark by which they could be distinguished from others (13:35), John shows that he is thinking of this scene in covenant terminology. But note that the disciples are to love "<i>Just as I have loved you</i>" (13:34). The love Jesus has for his followers cannot be duplicated by them in one sense, because it effects their salvation, since he lays down his life for them: it is an act of love that gives life to men. But in another sense, they can follow his example (recall <i>to the end, </i>13:1; also 1 John 3:16, 4:16 and the interpretation of Jesus' washing of the disciples' feet).

 <a name="fn1362" href="joh.htm#fnB1362"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:1)  Or "Believe in God." The translation of the two uses of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pisteuvete</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">pisteuete</FONT>) is difficult. Both may be either indicative or imperative, and as L. Morris points out (<i>John </i>[NICNT], 637), this results in a bewildering variety of possibilities. To complicate matters further, the first may be understood as a question: "Do you believe in God? Believe also in me." Morris argues against the KJV translation which renders the first <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pisteuvete</FONT> as indicative and the second as imperative on the grounds that for the writer of the Fourth Gospel, faith in Jesus is inseparable from faith in God. But this is precisely the point that Jesus is addressing in context. He is about to undergo rejection by his own people as their Messiah. The disciples' faith in him as Messiah and Lord would be cast into extreme doubt by these events, which the author makes clear were not at this time foreseen by the disciples. After the resurrection it is this identification between Jesus and the Father which needs to be reaffirmed (cf. John 20:24-29). Thus it seems best to take the first <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pisteuvete</FONT> as indicative and the second as imperative, producing the translation "You believe in God; believe also in me."<br>
 <a name="fn1363" href="joh.htm#fnB1363"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:2)  Many interpreters have associated <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">monaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">monai</FONT>) with an Aramaic word that can refer to a stopping place or resting place for a traveler on a journey. This is similar to one of the meanings the word can have in secular Greek (Pausanius 10.31.7). Origen understood the use here to refer to stations on the road to God. This may well have been the understanding of the Latin translators who translated <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">monhv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">monh</FONT>) by <i>mansio</i>, a stopping place. The English translation "mansions" can be traced back to Tyndale, but in Middle English the word simply meant "a dwelling place" (not necessarily large or imposing) with no connotation of being temporary. The interpretation put forward by Origen would have been well suited to Gnosticism, where the soul in its ascent passes through stages during which it is gradually purified of all that is material and therefore evil. It is much more likely that the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">monhv</FONT> should be related to its cognate verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mevnw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">menw</FONT>), which is frequently used in the Fourth Gospel to refer to the permanence of relationship between Jesus and the Father and/or Jesus and the believer. Thus the idea of a permanent dwelling place, rather than a temporary stopping place, would be in view. Luther's translation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">monaiv</FONT> by <i>Wohnungen</i> is very accurate here, as it has the connotation of a permanent residence.<br>
 <a name="fn1364" href="joh.htm#fnB1364"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (14:2)  Most interpreters have understood the reference to <i>my Father's house</i> as a reference to heaven, and the <i>dwelling places</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">monhv</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">monh</FONT>) as the permanent residences of believers there. This seems consistent with the vocabulary and the context, where in v. 3 Jesus speaks of coming again to take the disciples to himself. However, the phrase <i>in my Father's house</i> was used previously in the Fourth Gospel in 2:16 to refer to the temple in Jerusalem. The author in 2:19-22 then reinterpreted the temple as Jesus' body, which was to be destroyed in death and then rebuilt in resurrection after three days. Even more suggestive is the statement by Jesus in 8:35, "Now the slave does not remain (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mevnw</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">menw</FONT>) in the household forever, but the son remains (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mevnw</FONT>) forever." If in the imagery of the Fourth Gospel the phrase <i>in my Father's house</i> is ultimately a reference to Jesus' body, the relationship of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">monhv </FONT>to <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mevnw </FONT>suggests the permanent relationship of the believer to Jesus and the Father as an adopted son who remains in the household forever. In this case the "dwelling place" is "in" Jesus himself, where he is, whether in heaven or on earth. The statement in v. 3, "I will come again and receive you to myself," then refers not just to the parousia, but also to Jesus' post-resurrection return to the disciples in his glorified state, when by virtue of his death on their behalf they may enter into union with him and with the Father as adopted sons. Needless to say, this bears numerous similarities to Pauline theology, especially the concepts of adoption as sons and being "in Christ" which are prominent in passages like Eph 1. It is also important to note, however, the emphasis in the Fourth Gospel itself on the present reality of eternal life (John 5:24, 7:38-39, etc.) and the possibility of worshiping the Father "in the Spirit and in truth" (John 4:21-24) in the present age. There is a sense in which it is possible to say that the future reality is present now. See further J. McCaffrey, <i>The House With Many Rooms</i>.<br>
 <a name="fn1365" href="joh.htm#fnB1365"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tc</b> (14:2)  A number of MSS supply "that" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joti</FONT>) here. Should the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> be included or omitted? The external evidence is almost equally divided. Most Alexandrian and Western MSS favor inclusion (it is unusual for the Alexandrian to favor the <i>longer</i> reading) while most Byzantine MSS favor omission (again unusual). Complicating things is the reading of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>66, which aligns with the Byzantine. Because of the strength of a papyrus reading aligned with the Byzantine, and because the shorter reading is out of character for the Byzantine text, the shorter reading (omitting the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT>) could certainly be authentic. If the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> is included, there are no less than four possible translations of the phrase: (1) "Otherwise I would have told you [= warned you], because I am going to prepare a place" (2) "Otherwise would I have told you so, because I am going to prepare a place?" (3) "Otherwise I would have told you that I am going to prepare a place" (4) "Otherwise would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place?" The first option (1) can be understood only if "otherwise I would have told you" is a parenthetical statement, and the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> clause goes with the preceding "There are many dwelling places in my Father's house." Translations (2) and (4) should probably be ruled out because they imply a previous statement by Jesus that either (2) there are many dwelling places in his Father's house or (4) He was going off to prepare a place for them. There is no indication anywhere in the Fourth Gospel that Jesus had made such statements prior to this time. Finally, (3) is understandable--if there were no dwelling places, Jesus would have told them that he was going off to make dwelling places. But the following verse makes clear that Jesus' departure is not hypothetical but real--he is really going away. Thus all the possibilities for understanding the verse with the inclusion of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> present some difficulties. R. E. Brown is probably right when he states: "all in all, the translation without <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> makes the best sense" (<i>John </i>[AB], 2:620). Thus the following translation seems best: "Otherwise, I would have told you [= warned you]. I go to prepare a place."<br>

 <a name="fn1367" href="joh.htm#fnB1367"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:2)  Or "If not, would have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you?" What is the meaning of the last clause with or without the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT>? One of the questions that must be answered here is whether or not <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tovpo"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">topos</FONT>) is to be equated with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">monhv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">monh</FONT>). In Rev 12:8 <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tovpo"</FONT> is used to refer to a place in heaven, which would suggest that the two are essentially equal here. Jesus is going ahead of believers to prepare a place for them, a permanent dwelling place in heaven (the Father's house).<br>

Once again there is a difficult textual problem in this verse. Either assertion on the part of Jesus would be understandable: "you know the way where I am going" or "you know where I am going and you know the way." In this case the shorter reading is basically Alexandrian; the primary Western codex D sides with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>66 and the majority of Byzantine minuscules in favor of the longer reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiV thVn oJdovn oi[date</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai thn Jodon oidate</FONT>).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (14:4)  <i>Where I am going. </i>Jesus had spoken of his destination previously to the disciples, most recently in John 13:33. Where he was going was back to the Father, and they could not follow him there, but later he would return for them and they could join him then. The <i>way</i> he was going was via the cross. This he had also mentioned previously (e.g., 12:32) although his disciples did not understand at the time (cf. 12:33). As Jesus would explain in v. 6, although for him the <i>way</i> back to the Father was via the cross, for his disciples the "way" to where he was going was Jesus himself.<br>

The division of the external evidence is difficult, but would appear to favor the first alternative, since there is an Alexandrian-Western alliance supported by <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>66. In this case (a first class condition) Jesus promises the disciples that (assuming they have known him) they will know the Father. Contextually this fits better with the following phrase (7b) which asserts that "from the present time you know him and have seen him" (compare John 1:18).<br>

John 10:38). The question Jesus asks of Philip (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ouj pisteuvei"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ou pisteuei"</FONT>) expects the answer "yes." Note that the following statement is addressed to all the disciples, however, because the plural pronoun (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uJmi'n</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jumin</FONT>) is used. Jesus says that his teaching (the words he spoke to them all) did not originate from himself, but the Father who permanently remains (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mevnwn</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">menwn</FONT>) in relationship with Jesus performs his works. One would have expected "speaks his words" here rather than "performs his works"; many of the church fathers (e.g., Augustine and Chrysostom) identified the two by saying that Jesus' words were works. But there is an implicit contrast in the next verse between words and works, and v. 12 seems to demand that the works are real works, not just words. It is probably best to see the two terms as related but not identical; there is a progression in the idea here. Both Jesus' words (recall the Samaritans' response in John 4:42) and Jesus' works are revelatory of who he is, but as the next verse indicates, works have greater confirmatory power than words.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (14:12)  What are the <i>greater deeds</i> that Jesus speaks of, and how is this related to his going to the Father? It is clear from both John 7:39 and 16:7 that the Holy Spirit will not come until Jesus has departed. After Pentecost and the coming of the Spirit to indwell believers in a permanent relationship, believers would be empowered to perform even greater deeds than those Jesus did during his earthly ministry. When the early chapters of Acts are examined, it is clear that, from a numerical standpoint, the deeds of Peter and the other Apostles surpassed those of Jesus in a single day (the day of Pentecost). On that day more were added to the church than had become followers of Jesus during the entire three years of his earthly ministry. And the message went forth not just in Judea, Samaria, and Galilee, but to the farthest parts of the known world. This understanding of what Jesus meant by "greater deeds" is more probable than a reference to "more spectacular miracles." Certainly miraculous deeds were performed by the apostles as recounted in Acts, but these do not appear to have surpassed the works of Jesus himself in either degree or number.<br>

Finding an appropriate English translation for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">paravklhto"</FONT> is a very difficult task. No single English word has exactly the same range of meaning as the Greek word. "Comforter," used by some of the older English versions, appears to be as old as Wycliffe. But today it suggests a quilt or a sympathetic mourner at a funeral. "Counselor" is adequate, but too broad, in contexts like "marriage counselor" or "camp counselor." "Helper" or "Assistant" could also be used, but could suggest a subordinate rank. "Advocate," the word chosen for this translation, has more forensic overtones that the Greek word does, although in John 16:5-11 a forensic context is certainly present. Because an "advocate" is someone who "advocates" or supports a position or viewpoint and since this is what the Paraclete will do for the preaching of the disciples, it was selected in spite of the drawbacks.<br>

Here the post-resurrection appearances are primarily in view, since Jesus speaks of the disciples "seeing" him after the world can "see" him no longer in the following verse. But many commentators have taken v. 18 as a reference to the coming of the Spirit, since this has been the topic of the preceding verses. Still, vv. 19-20 appear to contain references to Jesus' appearances to the disciples after his resurrection. It may well be that another Johannine double meaning is found here, so that Jesus `returns' to his disciples in one sense in his appearances to them after his resurrection, but in another sense he `returns' in the person of the Holy Spirit to indwell them.<br>

But Jesus says he leaves <i>peace</i> with his disciples. This should probably be understood ultimately in terms of the indwelling of the Paraclete, the Holy Spirit, who has been the topic of the preceding verses. It is his presence, after Jesus has left the disciples and finally returned to the Father, which will remain with them and comfort them. <br>

 <a name="fn1428" href="joh.htm#fnB1428"><sup>68</sup></a><b>sn</b> (14:28)  Jesus' statement <i>the Father is greater than I am</i> has caused much christological and trinitarian debate. Although the Arians appealed to this text to justify their subordinationist Christology, it seems evident that by the fact Jesus compares himself to the Father, his divine nature is taken for granted. There have been two orthodox interpretations: (1) The Son is eternally generated while the Father is not: Origen, Tertullian, Athanasius, Hilary, etc. (2) As <i>man</i> the incarnate Son was less than the Father: Cyril of Alexandria, Ambrose, Augustine. In the context of the Fourth Gospel the second explanation seems more plausible. But why should the disciples have rejoiced? Because Jesus was on the way to the Father who would glorify him (cf. 17:4-5); his departure now signifies that the work the Father has given him is completed (cf. 19:30). Now Jesus will be glorified with that glory that he had with the Father before the world was (cf. 17:5). This should be a cause of rejoicing to the disciples because when Jesus is glorified he will glorify his disciples as well (17:22).<br>

 <a name="fn1435" href="joh.htm#fnB1435"><sup>75</sup></a><b>sn</b> (14:31)  Some have understood Jesus' statement <i>Get up, let us go from here</i> to mean that at this point Jesus and the disciples got up and left the room where the meal was served and began the journey to the garden of Gethsemane. If so, the rest of the Farewell Discourse took place <i>en route</i>. Others have pointed to this statement as one of the "seams" in the discourse, indicating that the author used preexisting sources. Both explanations are possible, but not really necessary. Jesus could simply have stood up at this point (the disciples may or may not have stood with him) to finish the discourse before finally departing (in 18:1). In any case it may be argued that Jesus refers not to a literal departure at this point, but to preparing to meet the enemy who is on the way already in the person of Judas and the soldiers with him.<br>
 <a name="fn1436" href="joh.htm#fnB1436"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:1)  <i>I am the true vine. </i>There are numerous OT passages which refer to Israel as a vine: Ps 80:8-16, Isa 5:1-7, Jer 2:21, Ezek 15:1-8, 17:5-10, 19:10-14, and Hos 10:1. The vine became symbolic of Israel, and even appeared on some coins issued by the Maccabees. The OT passages which use this symbol appear to regard Israel as faithless to Yahweh (typically rendered as "LORD" in the OT) and/or the object of severe punishment. Ezek 15:1-8 in particular talks about the worthlessness of wood from a vine (in relation to disobedient Judah). A branch cut from a vine is worthless except to be burned as fuel. This fits more with the statements about the disciples (John 15:6) than with Jesus' description of himself as the vine. Ezek 17:5-10 contains vine imagery which refers to a king of the house of David, Zedekiah, who was set up as king in Judah by Nebuchadnezzar. Zedekiah allied himself to Egypt and broke his covenant with Nebuchadnezzar (and therefore also with God), which would ultimately result in his downfall (17:20-21). Ezek 17:22-24 then describes the planting of a cedar sprig which grows into a lofty tree, a figurative description of Messiah. But it is significant that Messiah himself is not described in Ezek 17 as a vine, but as a cedar tree. The vine imagery here applies to Zedekiah's disobedience. Jesus' description of himself as the <i>true vine</i> in John 15:1 ff. is to be seen against this background, but it differs significantly from the imagery surveyed above. It represents new imagery which differs significantly from OT concepts; it appears to be original with Jesus. The imagery of the vine underscores the importance of fruitfulness in the Christian life and the truth that this results not from human achievement, but from one's position in Christ. Jesus is not just giving some comforting advice, but portraying to the disciples the difficult path of faithful service. To some degree the figure is similar to the head-body metaphor used by Paul, with Christ as head and believers as members of the body. Both metaphors bring out the vital and necessary connection which exists between Christ and believers.<br>

 <a name="fn1438" href="joh.htm#fnB1438"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:2)  Or "He cuts off." <br>
 <b>sn</b> (15:2)  The Greek verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aijrevw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">airew</FONT>) can mean "lift up" as well as "take away," and it is sometimes argued that here it is a reference to the gardener "lifting up" (i.e., propping up) a weak branch so that it bears fruit again. In Johannine usage the word occurs in the sense of "lift up" in 8:59 and 5:8-12, but in the sense of "remove" it is found in 11:39, 11:48, 16:22, and 17:15. In context (theological presuppositions aside for the moment) the meaning "remove" does seem more natural and less forced (particularly in light of v. 6, where worthless branches are described as being "thrown out"--an image that seems incompatible with restoration). One option, therefore, would be to understand the branches which are taken away (v. 2) and thrown out (v. 6) as believers who forfeit their salvation because of unfruitfulness. However, many see this interpretation as encountering problems with the Johannine teaching on the security of the believer, especially John 10:28-29. This leaves two basic ways of understanding Jesus' statements about removal of branches in 15:2 and 15:6: (1) These statements may refer to an unfaithful (disobedient) Christian, who is judged at the judgment seat of Christ "through fire" (cf. 1 Cor 3:11-15). In this case the "removal" of 15:2 may refer (in an extreme case) to the physical death of a disobedient Christian. (2) These statements may refer to someone who was never a genuine believer in the first place (e.g., Judas and the Jews who withdrew after Jesus' difficult teaching in 6:66), in which case 15:6 refers to eternal judgment. In either instance it is clear that 15:6 refers to the fires of judgment (cf. OT imagery in Ps 80:16 and Ezek 15:1-8). But view (1) requires us to understand this in terms of the judgment of believers at the judgment seat of Christ. This concept does not appear in the Fourth Gospel, because from the perspective of the author, the believer does not come under judgment: note especially 3:18, 5:24, 5:29. The first reference (3:18) is especially important because it occurs in the context of 3:16-21, the section which is key to the framework of the entire Fourth Gospel and which is repeatedly alluded to throughout. A similar image to this one is used by John the Baptist in Matt 3:10, "And the ax is already laid at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire." Since this is addressed to the Pharisees and Sadducees who were coming to John for baptism, it almost certainly represents a call to initial repentance. More importantly, however, the imagery of being cast into the fire constitutes a reference to eternal judgment, a use of imagery which is much nearer to the Johannine imagery in 15:6 than the Pauline concept of the judgment seat of Christ (a judgment for believers) mentioned above. The use of the Greek verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mevnw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">menw</FONT>) in 15:6 also supports view (2). When used of the relationship between Jesus and the disciple and/or Jesus and the Father, it emphasizes the permanence of the relationship (John 6:56, 8:31, 8:35, 14:10). The prototypical branch who has not remained is Judas, who departed in 13:30. He did not bear fruit, and is now in the realm of darkness, a mere tool of Satan. His eternal destiny, being cast into the fire of eternal judgment, is still to come. It seems most likely, therefore, that the branches who do not bear fruit and are taken away and burned are false believers, those who profess to belong to Jesus but who in reality do not belong to him. In the Gospel of John, the primary example of this category is Judas. In 1 John 2:18-19 the "antichrists" fall into the same category; they too may be thought of as branches that did not bear fruit. They departed from the ranks of the Christians because they never did really belong, and their departure shows that they did not belong.<br>

Although some claim that realized eschatology is so prevalent in the Fourth Gospel that no references to final eschatology appear at all, the fate of these branches seems to point to the opposite. The imagery is almost certainly that of eschatological judgment, and recalls some of the OT vine imagery which involves divine rejection and judgment of disobedient Israel (Ezek 15:4-6, 19:12).<br>

This recalls 14:13-14, where the disciples were promised that if they asked anything in Jesus' name it would be done for them. The two thoughts are really quite similar, since here it is conditioned on the disciples' remaining in Jesus and his words remaining in them. The first phrase relates to the genuineness of their relationship with Jesus. The second phrase relates to their obedience. When both of these qualifications are met, the disciples would in fact be asking in Jesus' name and therefore according to his will.<br>

 <a name="fn1462" href="joh.htm#fnB1462"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tc</b> (15:8)  Some MSS read a future indicative verb, "and become." The original reading is difficult to determine, because the external evidence is rather evenly divided. The aorist subjunctive <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">gevnhsqe</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">genhsqe</FONT>, "you are") is supported by most Alexandrian MSS including (apparently) <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>66, along with the Western uncial D.

Zerwick, <i>Biblical Greek</i> &#167;342). Thus the two actions are really one and the same: bearing fruit and being Jesus' disciple are not two different actions, but a single action. The first is the outward sign or proof of the second--in bearing fruit the disciples show themselves to be disciples indeed (cf. 15:5). Thus the translation followed here is, "that you bear much fruit and show that you are my disciples." As far as the textual reading is concerned, it appears preferable to accept the aorist subjunctive reading (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">gevnhsqe</FONT>).<br>

This is the `new commandment' of John 13:34, and it is repeated in 15:17. The disciples' love for one another is compared to Jesus' love for them. How has Jesus shown his love for the disciples? This was illustrated in 13:1-20 in the washing of the disciples' feet, introduced by the statement in 13:1 that Jesus loved them "to the end." In context this constitutes a reference to Jesus' self-sacrificial death on the cross on their behalf; the love they are to have for one another is so great that it must include a self-sacrificial willingness to die for one another if necessary. This is exactly what Jesus is discussing here, because he introduces the theme of his sacrificial death in the following verse. In John 10:18 and 14:31 Jesus spoke of his death on the cross as a commandment he had received from his Father, which also links the idea of commandment and love as they are linked here. One final note: it is not just the degree or intensity of the disciples' love for one another that Jesus is referring to when he introduces by comparison his own death on the cross (that they must love one another enough to die for one another) but the very means of expressing that love: it is to express itself in self-sacrifice for one another, sacrifice up to the point of death, which is what Jesus himself did on the cross (cf. 1 John 3:16).<br>

Those who keep Jesus' commandments are called his <i>friends</i>, those friends for whom he lays down his life (v. 13). It is possible to understand this verse as referring to a smaller group within Christianity as a whole, perhaps only the apostles who were present when Jesus spoke these words. Some have supported this by comparing it to the small group of associates and advisors to the Roman Emperor who were called "Friends of the Emperor." Others would see these words as addressed only to those Christians who as disciples were obedient to Jesus. In either case the result would be to create a sort of "inner circle" of Christians who are more privileged than mere "believers" or average Christians. In context, it seems clear that Jesus' words must be addressed to all true Christians, not just some narrower category of believers, because Jesus' sacrificial death, which is his act of love toward his <i>friends</i> (v. 13) applies to all Christians equally (cf. John 13:1).<br>

Again this is true of all Christians, not just the twelve, and the theme that Christians are "chosen" by God appears frequently in other NT texts (e.g., Rom 8:33; Eph 1:4ff.; Col 3:12; and 1 Pet 2:4). Putting this together with the comments on 15:14 one may ask whether the author sees any special significance at all for the twelve. Jesus said in John 6:70 and 13:18 that he chose them, and 15:27 makes clear that Jesus in the immediate context is addressing those who have been with him from the beginning. In the Fourth Gospel the twelve, as the most intimate and most committed followers of Jesus, are presented as the models for all Christians, both in terms of their election and in terms of their mission.<br>

The introduction of the idea of "going" at this point suggests that the fruit is something more than just character qualities in the disciples' own lives, but rather involves fruit in the lives of others, i.e., Christian converts. There is a mission involved (cf. John 4:36). The idea that their fruit is permanent, however, relates back to vv. 7-8, as does the reference to asking the Father in Jesus' name. It appears that as the imagery of the vine and the branches develops, the "fruit" which the branches produce shifts in emphasis from qualities in the disciples' own lives in John 15:2, 4, 5 to the idea of a mission which affects the lives of others in John 15:16. The point of transition would be the reference to fruit in 15:8.<br>

 <a name="fn1486" href="joh.htm#fnB1486"><sup>51</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:19)  <i>I chose you out of the world...the world hates you. </i>Two themes are brought together here. In 8:23 Jesus had distinguished himself from the world in addressing his Jewish opponents: "You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world." In 15:16 Jesus told the disciples "You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you." Now Jesus has united these two ideas as he informs the disciples that he has chosen them out of the world. While the disciples will still be "in" the world after Jesus has departed, they will not belong to it, and Jesus prays later in John 17:15-16 to the Father, "I do not ask you to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world." The same theme also occurs in 1 John 4:5-6: "<i>They</i> are from the world; therefore <i>they</i> speak as from the world, and the world listens to <i>them</i>. <i>We</i> are from God; he who knows God listens to <i>us</i>; he who is not from God does not listen to <i>us</i>." Thus the basic reason why the world <i>hates</i> the disciples (as it hated Jesus before them) is because they are not of the world. They are born from above, and are not of the world. For this reason the world hates them.<br>

As the master has been treated, so will the slaves be treated also. If the world had persecuted Jesus, then it would also persecute the disciples. If the world had kept Jesus' word, it would likewise keep the word of the disciples. In this statement there is the implication that the disciples would carry on the ministry of Jesus after his departure; they would in their preaching and teaching continue to spread the message which Jesus himself had taught while he was with them. And they would meet with the same response, by and large, that he encountered.<br>

Jesus was not saying that if he had not come and spoken to these people they would be sinless; rather he was saying that if he <i>had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of</i> the <i>sin</i> of rejecting him and the Father he came to reveal. Rejecting Jesus is the one ultimate sin for which there can be no forgiveness, because the one who has committed this sin has at the same time rejected the only cure that exists.

(Some point out John 14:9 as an example, but this is addressed to the disciples, not to the world.) It is more likely that the "seeing" refers to the miraculous deeds mentioned in the first half of the verse.

Similar usage is found in <i>Didache</i> 16:5, an early Christian writing from around the beginning of the 2nd century A.D. An example of a disciple who falls away is Judas Iscariot. Here and again in 16:4 Jesus gives the purpose for his telling the disciples about coming persecution: so that when it happens, the disciples <i>will not fall away</i>, which in this context would refer to the confusion and doubt which they would certainly experience when such persecution began. There may have been a tendency for the disciples to expect immediately after Jesus' victory over death the institution of the messianic kingdom, particularly in light of the turn of events recorded in the early chapters of Acts. Jesus here forestalls such disillusionment for the disciples by letting them know in advance that they will face persecution and even martyrdom as they seek to carry on his mission in the world after his departure. This material has parallels in the Olivet Discourse (Matt 24-25) and the synoptic parallels.<br>

There will even be a time when those who kill Jesus' disciples will think that they are <i>offering service to God</i> by putting the disciples to death. Because of the reference to service offered to God, it is almost certain that Jewish opposition is intended here in both cases rather than Jewish opposition in the first instance (putting the disciples out of synagogues) and Roman opposition in the second (putting the disciples to death). Such opposition materializes later and is recorded in Acts: the stoning of Stephen in 7:58-60 and the slaying of James the brother of John by Herod Agrippa I in Acts 12:2-3 are notable examples.<br>

At that point Peter had inquired where he was going, but it appears that Peter did not understand Jesus' reply at that time and did not persist in further questioning.

Their shock at Jesus' revelation of coming persecution is so great that none of them thinks to ask him where it is that he is going.<br>

 <a name="fn1520" href="joh.htm#fnB1520"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:8)  Or "will convict the world," or "will expose the world." The conjunction <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">periv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">peri</FONT>) is used in 16:8-11 in the sense of "concerning" or "with respect to." But what about the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejlevgcw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">elencw</FONT>)? The basic meanings possible for this word are (1) "to convict or convince someone of something"; (2) "to bring to light or expose something; and (3) "to correct or punish someone." The third possibility may be ruled out in these verses on contextual grounds since punishment is not implied. The meaning is often understood to be that the Paraclete will "convince" the world of its error, so that some at least will repent. But S. Mowinckel ("Die Vorstellungen des Sp&auml;tjudentums vom heiligen Geist als F&uuml;rsprecher und der johanneische Paraklet," <i>ZNW </i>32 [1933]: 97-130) demonstrated that the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejlevgcw</FONT> did not necessarily imply the conversion or reform of the guilty party. This means it is far more likely that conviction in something of a legal sense is intended here (as in a trial). The only certainty is that the accused party is indeed proven guilty (not that they will acknowledge their guilt). Further confirmation of this interpretation is seen in John 14:17 where the world cannot receive the Paraclete and in John 3:20, where the evildoer deliberately refuses to come to the light, lest his deeds be exposed for what they really are (significantly, the verb in John 3:20 is also <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejlevgcw</FONT>). However, if one wishes to adopt the meaning "prove guilty" for the use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejlevgcw</FONT> in John 16:8 a difficulty still remains: while this meaning fits the first statement in 16:9--the world is `proven guilty' concerning its sin of refusing to believe in Jesus--it does not fit so well the second and third assertions in vv. 10-11. Thus R. E. Brown (<i>John</i> [AB], 2:705) suggests the more general meaning `prove wrong' which would fit in all three cases. This may be so, but there may also be a developmental aspect to the meaning, which would then shift from v. 9 to v. 10 to v. 11.<br>

 <a name="fn1523" href="joh.htm#fnB1523"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:9)  Or "that." It is very difficult to determine whether <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joti</FONT>; 3 times in 16:9, 10, 11) should be understood as causal or appositional/explanatory: Brown and Bultmann favor appositional or explanatory, while Barrett and Morris prefer a causal sense. A causal idea is preferable here, since it also fits the parallel statements in vv. 10-11 better than an appositional or explanatory use would. In this case Jesus is stating in each instance the reason why the world is proven guilty or wrong by the Spirit-Paraclete.<br>
 <a name="fn1524" href="joh.htm#fnB1524"><sup>21</sup></a><b>sn</b> (16:9)  Here (v. 9) the world is proven guilty concerning sin, and the reason given is their refusal to <i>believe</i> in Jesus. In 3:19 the effect of Jesus coming into the world as the Light of the world was to provoke judgment, by forcing people to choose up sides for or against him, and they chose darkness rather than light. In 12:37, at the very end of Jesus' public ministry in John's Gospel, people were still refusing to believe in him.<br>
 <a name="fn1525" href="joh.htm#fnB1525"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:10)  There are two questions that need to be answered: (1) what is the meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dikaiosuvnh</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">dikaiosunh</FONT>) in this context, and (2) to whom does it pertain--to the world, or to someone else? (1) The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dikaiosuvnh</FONT> occurs in the Gospel of John only here and in v. 8. It is often assumed that it refers to forensic justification, as it does so often in Paul's writings. Thus the answer to question (2) would be that it refers to the world. L. Morris states, "The Spirit shows men (and no-one else can do this) that their righteousness before God depends not on their own efforts but on Christ's atoning work for them" (<i>John</i> [NICNT], 699). Since the word occurs so infrequently in the Fourth Gospel, however, the context must be examined very carefully. The <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joti</FONT>) clause which follows provides an important clue: the righteousness in view here has to do with Jesus' return to the Father and his absence from the disciples. It is true that in the Fourth Gospel part of what is involved in Jesus' return to the Father is the cross, and it is through his substitutionary death that people are justified, so that Morris' understanding of righteousness here is possible. But more basic than this is the idea that Jesus' return to the Father constitutes his own <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dikaiosuvnh</FONT> in the sense of vindication rather than forensic justification. Jesus had repeatedly claimed oneness with the Father, and his opponents had repeatedly rejected this and labeled him a deceiver, a sinner, and a blasphemer (John 5:18, 7:12, 9:24, 10:33, etc.). But Jesus, by his glorification through his return to the Father, is vindicated in his claims in spite of his opponents. In his vindication his followers are also vindicated as well, but their vindication derives from his. Thus one would answer question (1) by saying that in context <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dikaiosuvnh"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">dikaiosunh"</FONT>) refers not to forensic justification but vindication, and question (2) by referring this justification/vindication not to the world or even to Christians directly, but to Jesus himself. Finally, how does Jesus' last statement in v. 10, that the disciples will see him no more, contribute to this? It is probably best taken as a reference to the presence of the Spirit-Paraclete, who cannot come until Jesus has departed (16:7). The meaning of v. 10 is thus: when the Spirit-Paraclete comes he will prove the world wrong concerning the subject of righteousness, namely, Jesus' righteousness which is demonstrated when he is glorified in his return to the Father and the disciples see him no more (but they will have instead the presence of the Spirit-Paraclete, whom the world is not able to receive).<br>
 <a name="fn1526" href="joh.htm#fnB1526"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:10)  Or "that."<br>
 <a name="fn1527" href="joh.htm#fnB1527"><sup>24</sup></a><b>sn</b> (16:11)  The world is proven wrong <i>concerning judgment</i>, because the ruler of this world has been judged. Jesus' righteousness before the Father, as proven by his return to the Father, his glorification, constitutes a judgment against Satan. This is parallel to the judgment of the world which Jesus provokes in 3:19-21: Jesus' presence in the world as the Light of the world provokes the judgment of those in the world, because as they respond to the light (either coming to Jesus or rejecting him) so are they judged. That judgment is in a sense already realized. So it is here, where the judgment of Satan is already realized in Jesus' glorification. This does not mean that Satan does not continue to be active in the world, and to exercise some power over it, just as in 3:19-21 the people in the world who have rejected Jesus and thus incurred judgment continue on in their opposition to Jesus for a time. In both cases the judgment is not immediately executed. But it is certain.<br>

 <a name="fn1531" href="joh.htm#fnB1531"><sup>28</sup></a><b>sn</b> (16:12)  In what sense does Jesus have <i>many more things</i> to say to the disciples? Does this imply the continuation of revelation after his departure? This is probably the case, especially in light of v. 13 and following, which describe the work of the Holy Spirit in guiding the disciples <i>into all truth</i>. Thus Jesus was saying that he would continue to speak (to the twelve, at least) after his return to the Father. He would do this through the Holy Spirit whom he was going to send. It is possible that an audience broader than the twelve is addressed, and in the Johannine tradition there is evidence that later other Christians (or perhaps, professed Christians) claimed to be recipients of revelation through the Spirit-Paraclete (1 John 4:1-6).<br>

 <a name="fn1535" href="joh.htm#fnB1535"><sup>32</sup></a><b>sn</b> (16:13)  Three important points must be noted here. (1) When the Holy Spirit comes, he will <i>guide</i> the disciples <i>into all truth</i>. What Jesus had said in 8:31-32, "If you continue to follow my teaching you are really my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free," will ultimately be realized in the ongoing ministry of the Holy Spirit to the disciples after Jesus' departure. (2) The things the Holy Spirit speaks to them will not be things which originate from himself (<i>he will not speak on his own authority</i>), but things he has heard. This could be taken to mean that no new revelation is involved, as R. E. Brown does (<i>John </i>[AB], 2:714-15). This is a possible but not a necessary inference. The point here concerns the source of the things the Spirit will say to the disciples and does not specifically exclude originality of content. (3) Part at least of what the Holy Spirit will reveal to the disciples will concern <i>what is to come</i>, not just fuller implications of previous sayings of Jesus and the like. This does seem to indicate<i> </i>that at least some new revelation is involved. But the Spirit is not the source or originator of these things--Jesus is the source, and he will continue to speak to his disciples through the Spirit who has come to indwell them. This does not answer the question, however, whether these words are addressed to all followers of Jesus, or only to his apostles. Different modern commentators will answer this question differently. Since in the context of the Farewell Discourse Jesus is preparing the twelve to carry on his ministry after his departure, it is probably best to take these statements as specifically related only to the twelve. Some of this the Holy Spirit does directly for all believers today; other parts of this statement are fulfilled through the apostles (e.g., in giving the Book of Revelation the Spirit speaks through the apostles to the church today of things to come). One of the implications of this is that a doctrine does not have to be traced back to an explicit teaching of Jesus to be authentic; all that is required is apostolic authority.<br>

The change from "you will see [me]" to <i>I will see you</i> places more emphasis on Jesus as the one who re-initiates the relationship with the disciples after his resurrection, but v. 16 (<i>you will see me</i>) is more like Isa 66:14. Further support for seeing this allusion as intentional is found in Isa 66:7, which uses the same imagery of the woman giving birth found in John 16:21. In the context of Isa 66 the passages refer to the institution of the messianic kingdom, and in fact the last clause of 66:14 along with the following verses (15-17) have yet to be fulfilled. This is part of the tension of present and future eschatological fulfillment that runs throughout the NT, by virtue of the fact that there are two advents. Some prophecies are fulfilled or partially fulfilled at the first advent, while other prophecies or parts of prophecies await fulfillment at the second.<br>

In the preceding context of the Farewell Discourse Jesus has certainly used obscure language and imagery at times: John 13:8-11; 13:16; 15:1-17; and 16:21 could all be given as examples.

 <b>sn</b> (16:29)  How is the disciples' reply to Jesus<i> now you are speaking plainly and not in obscure figures of speech</i> to be understood? Their claim to understand seems a bit impulsive. It is difficult to believe that the disciples have really understood the full implications of Jesus' words, although it is true that he spoke to them plainly and not figuratively in 16:26-28. The disciples will not fully understand all that Jesus has said to them until after his resurrection, when the Holy Spirit will give them insight and understanding (16:13).<br>

This parallels the synoptic accounts in Matt 26:31 and Mark 14:27 when Jesus, after the last supper and on the way to Gethsemane, foretold the desertion of the disciples as a fulfillment of Zech 13:7: "Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered."

It appears best to understand the "hour" as a period of time starting at the end of Jesus' public ministry and extending through the passion week, ending with Jesus' return to the Father through death, resurrection, and exaltation. The "hour" begins as soon as the first events occur which begin the process that leads to Jesus' death.<br>

 <a name="fn1610" href="joh.htm#fnB1610"><sup>7</sup></a><b>sn</b> (17:3)  <i>This is eternal life. </i>The author here defines <i>eternal life</i> for the readers, although it is worked into the prayer in such a way that many interpreters do not regard it as another of the author's parenthetical comments. It is not just unending life in the sense of prolonged duration. Rather it is a quality of life, with its qualitativeness derived from a relationship with God. Having eternal life is here defined as being in relationship with the Father, the one true God, and Jesus Christ whom the Father sent. <i>Christ </i>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Cristov"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Cristos</FONT>) is not characteristically attached to Jesus' name in John's Gospel; it occurs elsewhere primarily as a title and is used with Jesus' name only in 1:17. But that is connected to its use here: the statement here in 17:3 enables us to correlate the statement made in 1:18 of the prologue, that Jesus has fully revealed what God is like, with Jesus' statement in 10:10 that he has come that people might have life, and have it abundantly. These two purposes are really one, according to 17:3, because (abundant) eternal life is defined as knowing (being in relationship with) the Father and the Son. The only way to gain this eternal life, that is, to obtain this knowledge of the Father, is through the Son (cf. 14:6). Although some have pointed to the use of <i>know </i>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ginwvskw</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ginwskw</FONT>) here as evidence of Gnostic influence in the Fourth Gospel, there is a crucial difference: for John this knowledge is not intellectual, but relational.

 <b>sn</b> (17:4)  <i>By completing the work. </i>The idea of Jesus being sent into the world on a mission has been mentioned before, significantly in 3:17. It was even alluded to in the immediately preceding verse here (17:3). The completion of the "work" the Father had sent him to accomplish was mentioned by Jesus in 4:34 and 5:36. What is the nature of the "work" the Father has given the Son to accomplish? It involves the Son's mission to be the Savior of the world, as 3:17 indicates. But this is accomplished specifically through Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross (a thought implied by the reference to the Father "giving" the Son in 3:16). It is not without significance that Jesus' last word from the cross is "<i>It is completed</i>" (19:30).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (17:10)  The theme of glory with which Jesus began this prayer in 17:1-5 now recurs. Jesus said that he had been <i>glorified</i> by his disciples, but in what sense was this true? Jesus had manifested his glory to them in all of the sign-miracles which he had performed, beginning with the miracle at the wedding feast in Cana (2:11). He could now say that he had <i>been glorified by them</i> in the light of what he had already said in vv. 7-8, that the disciples had come to know that he had come from the Father and been sent by the Father. He would, of course, be glorified by them further after the resurrection, as they carried on his ministry after his departure.<br>

Immediately after this Judas left the company of Jesus and the other disciples and went out into the realm of darkness (13:30).

In view of the frequent use of the masculine in 1 John 2:13-14, 3:12, and 5:18-19 it seems much more probable that the masculine is to be understood here, and that Jesus is praying for his disciples to be protected from Satan.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (17:17)  The Greek word translated <i>set...apart</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aJgiavzw</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jagiazw</FONT>) is used here in its normal sense of being dedicated, consecrated, or set apart. The sphere in which the disciples are to be set apart is <i>in the truth</i>. In 3:21 the idea of "practicing" (<i>Grk</i> "doing") the truth was introduced; in 8:32 Jesus told some of his hearers that if they continued in his word they would truly be his disciples, and would know the truth, and the truth would make them free. These disciples who are with Jesus now for the Farewell Discourse have continued in his word (except for Judas Iscariot, who has departed), and they do know the truth about who Jesus is and why he has come into the world (17:8). Thus Jesus can ask the Father to set them apart in this truth as he himself is set apart, so that they might carry on his mission in the world after his departure (note the following verse).<br>
 <a name="fn1655" href="joh.htm#fnB1655"><sup>52</sup></a><b>sn</b> (17:18)  Jesus now compared the mission on which he was sending the disciples to his own mission <i>into the world</i>, on which he was sent by the Father. As the Father sent Jesus into the world (cf. 3:17), so Jesus now sends the disciples into the world to continue his mission after his departure. The nature of this prayer for the disciples as a consecratory prayer is now emerging: Jesus was setting them apart for the work he had called them to do. They were, in a sense, being commissioned.<br>
 <a name="fn1656" href="joh.htm#fnB1656"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:19)  Or "I sanctify."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (17:19)  In what sense does Jesus refer to his own `sanctification' with the phrase <i>I set myself apart</i>? In 10:36 Jesus referred to himself as "the one whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world," which seems to look at something already accomplished. Here, however, it is something he does on behalf of the disciples (<i>on their behalf</i>) and this suggests a reference to his impending death on the cross. There is in fact a Johannine wordplay here based on slightly different meanings for the Greek verb translated <i>set apart </i>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aJgiavzw</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jagiazw</FONT>). In the sense it was used in 10:36 of Jesus and in 17:17 and here to refer to the disciples, it means to set apart in the sense that prophets (cf. Jer 1:5) and priests (Exod 40:13, Lev 8:30, and 2 Chr 5:11) were consecrated (or set apart) to perform their tasks. But when Jesus speaks of setting himself apart (consecrating or dedicating himself) on behalf of the disciples here in 17:19 the meaning is closer to the consecration of a sacrificial animal (Deut 15:19). Jesus is "setting himself apart," i.e., dedicating himself, to do the will of the Father, that is, to go to the cross on the disciples' behalf (and of course on behalf of their successors as well).<br>

This will include not only Jewish Christians, but other Gentile Christians who are "not of this fold" (10:16), and thus Jesus' prayer for unity is especially appropriate in light of the probability that most of the readers of the Gospel are Gentiles (much as Paul stresses unity between Jewish and Gentile Christians in Eph 2:10-22).<br>

The author states that Jesus <i>went out with his disciples</i>, a probable reference to their leaving the upper room where the meal and discourse described in chaps. 13-17 took place (although some have seen this only as a reference to their leaving the city, with the understanding that some of the Farewell Discourse, including the concluding prayer, was given <i>en route</i>, cf. 14:31). They crossed the Kidron Valley and came to a garden, or olive orchard, identified in Matt 26:36 and Mark 14:32 as Gethsemane.

The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">spei'ran</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">speiran</FONT>) is a technical term for a Roman cohort, normally a force of 600 men (one tenth of a legion). It was under the command of a <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">cilivarco"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ciliarco"</FONT>, v. 12). Because of the improbability of an entire cohort being sent to arrest a single man, some have suggested that <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">spei'ran</FONT> here refers only to a maniple, a force of 200. But the use of the word here does not necessarily mean the entire cohort was present on this mission, but only that it was the cohort which performed the task (for example, saying the fire department put out the fire does not mean that every fireman belonging to the department was on the scene at the time). These Roman soldiers must have been ordered to accompany the servants of the chief priests and Pharisees by Pilate, since they would have been under the direct command of the Roman prefect or procurator. It is not difficult to understand why Pilate would have been willing to assist the Jewish authorities in such a way. With a huge crowd of pilgrims in Jerusalem for the Passover, the Romans would have been especially nervous about an uprising of some sort. No doubt the chief priests and Pharisees had informed Pilate that this man Jesus was claiming to be the Messiah, or in the terms Pilate would understand, king of Israel.<br>

They are different from the Levites who served as "temple police" according to K. H. Rengstorf (<i>TDNT</i> 8:540). In John 7:32ff. these officers had made an unsuccessful attempt to arrest Jesus, and perhaps this is part of the reason why their leaders had made sure they were accompanied by Roman soldiers this time. No more mistakes were to be tolerated.<br>

It may have been the commander of the Roman soldiers, although his presence is not explicitly mentioned until 18:12. It may also have been one of the officers of the chief priests. To the answer given, "Jesus the Nazarene," Jesus replies "I am [he]."<br>
 <a name="fn1681" href="joh.htm#fnB1681"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:5)  This is a parenthetical note by the author. Before he states the response to Jesus' identification of himself, the author inserts a parenthetical note that Judas, again identified as <i>the one who betrayed him</i> (cf. 18:2), was standing with the group of soldiers and officers of the chief priests. Many commentators have considered this to be an awkward insertion, but in fact it heightens considerably the dramatic effect of the response to Jesus' self-identification in the following verse, and has the added effect of informing the reader that along with the others the betrayer himself ironically falls down at Jesus' feet (18:6).<br>

 <a name="fn1684" href="joh.htm#fnB1684"><sup>16</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:6)  When Jesus said to those who came to arrest him "I am," <i>they retreated and fell to the ground</i>. L. Morris says that "it is possible that those in front recoiled from Jesus' unexpected advance, so that they bumped those behind them, causing them to stumble and fall" (<i>John </i>[NICNT], 743-44). Perhaps this is what in fact happened on the scene; but the theological significance given to this event by the author implies that more is involved. The reaction on the part of those who came to arrest Jesus comes in response to his affirmation that he is indeed the one they are seeking, Jesus the Nazarene. But Jesus makes this affirmation of his identity using a formula which the reader has encountered before in the Fourth Gospel, e.g., 8:24, 28, 58. Jesus has applied to himself the divine Name of Exod 3:14, "I AM." Therefore this amounts to something of a theophany which causes even his enemies to recoil and prostrate themselves, so that Jesus has to ask a second time, "Who are you looking for?" This is a vivid reminder to the reader of the Gospel that even in this dark hour, Jesus holds ultimate power over his enemies and the powers of darkness, because he is the one who bears the divine Name.<br>

Jesus also added, "<i>If you are looking for me, let these men go</i>." Jesus successfully diverted attention from his disciples by getting the soldiers and officers of the chief priests to admit (twice) that it is only him they were after. Even in this hour Jesus still protected and cared for his own, giving himself up on their behalf. By handing himself over to his enemies, Jesus ensured that his disciples went free. From the perspective of the author, this is acting out beforehand what Jesus will actually do for his followers when he goes to the cross.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (18:9)  This action of Jesus on behalf of his disciples is interpreted by the author as a fulfillment of Jesus' own words: "<i>I have not lost a single one of those whom you gave me</i>." Here it is Jesus' own words, rather than the OT scriptures, which are quoted. This same formula will be used by the author again of Jesus' words in 18:32, but the verb is used elsewhere in the Fourth Gospel to describe the NT fulfillment of OT passages (12:38, 13:18, 15:25, 17:12, 19:24, and 19:36). It is a bit difficult to determine the exact referent, since the words of Jesus quoted in this verse are not an exact reproduction of a saying of Jesus elsewhere in John's Gospel. Although some have identified the saying with John 6:39, the closest parallel is in 17:12, where the betrayer, Judas, is specifically excluded. The words quoted here in 18:9 appear to be a free rendition of 17:12.<br>

In connection with the synoptic accounts it is mentioned in Jesus' prayer; this occurrence certainly complements the synoptic accounts if Jesus had only shortly before finished praying about this.

 <a name="fn1703" href="joh.htm#fnB1703"><sup>35</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:13)  Jesus was taken first to <i>Annas</i>. Only the Gospel of John mentions this pre-trial hearing before Annas, and that Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who is said to be high priest in that year. Caiaphas is also mentioned as being high priest in John 11:49. But in 18:15, 16, 19, and 22 Annas is called high priest. Annas is also referred to as high priest by Luke in Acts 4:6. Many scholars have dismissed these references as mistakes on the part of both Luke and John, but as mentioned above, John 11:49 and 18:13 indicate that John knew that Caiaphas was high priest in the year that Jesus was crucified. This has led others to suggest that Annas and Caiaphas shared the high priesthood, but there is no historical evidence to support this view. Annas had been high priest from A.D. 6 to A.D. 15 when he was deposed by the Roman prefect Valerius Gratus (according to Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 18.2.2 [18.34]). His five sons all eventually became high priests. The family was noted for its greed, wealth and power. There are a number of ways the references in both Luke and John to Annas being high priest may be explained. Some Jews may have refused to recognize the changes in high priests effected by the Roman authorities, since according to the Torah the high priesthood was a lifetime office (Num 25:25). Another possibility is that it was simply customary to retain the title after a person had left the office as a courtesy, much as retired ambassadors are referred to as "Mr. Ambassador" or ex-presidents as "Mr. President." Finally, the use of the title by Luke and John may simply be a reflection of the real power behind the high priesthood of the time: although Annas no longer technically held the office, he may well have managed to control those relatives of his who did hold it from behind the scenes. In fact this seems most probable and would also explain why Jesus was brought to him immediately after his arrest for a sort of "pre-trial hearing" before being sent on to the entire Sanhedrin.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (18:15)  Many have associated this unnamed <i>other disciple</i> with the beloved disciple, that is, John son of Zebedee, mainly because the phrase <i>the other disciple</i> which occurs here is also used to describe the beloved disciple in John 20:2, 3, 4, and 8. Peter is also closely associated with the beloved disciple in 13:23-26, 20:2-10, 21:7, and 21:20-23. But other identifications have also been proposed, chiefly because v. 16 states that this disciple who was accompanied by Peter was known to the high priest. As C. K. Barrett (<i>St. John</i>, 525) points out, the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">gnwstov"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">gnwstos</FONT>) is used in the LXX to refer to a close friend (Ps 54:14 LXX [55:14 ET]). This raises what for some is an insurmountable difficulty in identifying the "other disciple" as John son of Zebedee, since how could the uneducated son of an obscure Galilean fisherman be known to such a powerful and influential family in Jerusalem? E. A. Abbott (as quoted in "Notes of Recent Exposition," <i>ExpTim </i>25 [1913/14]: 149-50) proposed that the "other disciple" who accompanied Peter was Judas, since he was the one disciple of whom it is said explicitly (in the synoptic accounts) that he had dealings with the high priest. E. A. Tindall ("Contributions and Comments: John xviii.15," <i>ExpTim </i>28 [1916/17]: 283-84) suggested the disciple was Nicodemus, who as a member of the Sanhedrin, would have had access to the high priest's palace. Both of these suggestions, while ingenious, nevertheless lack support from the text of the Fourth Gospel itself or the synoptic accounts. W. Wuellner (<i>The Meaning of </i>"<i>Fishers of Men</i>") argues that the common attitude concerning the low social status and ignorance of the disciples from Galilee may in fact be a misconception. Zebedee is presented in Mark 1:20 as a man wealthy enough to have hired servants, and Mark 10:35-45 presents both of the sons of Zebedee as concerned about status and prestige. John's mother appears in the same light in Matt 20:20-28. Contact with the high priestly family in Jerusalem might not be so unlikely in such circumstances. Others have noted the possibility that John came from a priestly family, some of which is based upon a statement in Eusebius (<i>Ecclesiastical History </i>3.31.3) quoting Polycrates that John son of Zebedee was a priest. For further information on possible priestly connections among members of John's family see L. Morris (<i>John </i>[NICNT], 752, n. 32). None of this is certain, but on the whole it seems most probable that the disciple who accompanied Peter and gained entry into the courtyard for him was John son of Zebedee.<br>

They must have been taken somewhat by surprise by Pilate's question<i> </i>"<i>What accusation do you bring against this man</i>," because it indicated that he was going to try the prisoner himself.

 <a name="fn1754" href="joh.htm#fnB1754"><sup>86</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:31)  Pilate, as the sole representative of Rome in a troubled area, was probably in Jerusalem for the Passover because of the danger of an uprising (the normal residence for the Roman governor was in Caesarea as mentioned in Acts 23:35). At this time on the eve of the feast he would have been a busy and perhaps even a worried man. It is not surprising that he offered to hand Jesus back over to the Jewish authorities to pass judgment on him. It may well be that Pilate realized when no specific charge was mentioned that he was dealing with an internal dispute over some religious matter. Pilate wanted nothing to do with such matters, as the statement "<i>Pass judgment on him according to your own law!</i>" indicates. As far as the author is concerned, this points out who was really responsible for Jesus' death: the Roman governor Pilate would have had nothing to do with it if he had not been pressured by the Jewish religious authorities, upon whom the real responsibility rested.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (18:31)  The historical background behind the statement<i> We cannot legally put anyone to death</i> is difficult to reconstruct. Scholars are divided over whether this statement in the Fourth Gospel accurately reflects the judicial situation between the Jewish authorities and the Romans in 1st century Palestine. It appears that the Roman governor may have given the Jews the power of capital punishment for specific offenses, some of them religious (the death penalty for Gentiles caught trespassing in the inner courts of the temple, for example). It is also pointed out that the Jewish authorities did carry out a number of executions, some of them specifically pertaining to Christians (Stephen, according to Acts 7:58-60; and James the Just, who was stoned in the 60s according to Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 20.9.1 [20.200]). But Stephen's death may be explained as a result of "mob violence" rather than a formal execution, and as Josephus in the above account goes on to point out, James was executed in the period between two Roman governors, and the high priest at the time was subsequently punished for the action. Two studies by A. N. Sherwin-White (<i>Roman Society and Roman Law in the New Testament</i>, 1-47; and "The Trial of Christ," <i>Historicity and Chronology in the New Testament</i>, 97-116) have tended to support the accuracy of John's account. He concluded that the Romans kept very close control of the death penalty for fear that in the hands of rebellious locals such power could be used to eliminate factions favorable or useful to Rome. A province as troublesome as Judea would not have been likely to be made an exception to this.<br>

These references may explain the lack of extra-biblical attestation: the custom to which Pilate refers here (18:39) is not a permanent one acknowledged by all the Roman governors, but one peculiar to Pilate as a means of appeasement, meant to better relations with his subjects.

 <b>sn</b> (19:1)  This severe flogging was not administered by Pilate himself but his officers, who took Jesus at Pilate's order and scourged him. The author's choice of wording here may constitute an allusion to Isa 50:6, "I gave my back to those who scourge me." Three forms of corporal punishment were employed by the Romans, in increasing degree of severity: (1) <i>fustigatio</i> (beating), (2) <i>flagellatio </i>(flogging), and (3) <i>verberatio </i>(severe flogging, scourging). The first could be on occasion a punishment in itself, but the more severe forms were part of the capital sentence as a prelude to crucifixion. The most severe, <i>verberatio</i>, is what is indicated here by the Greek verb translated <i>flogged severely</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mastigovw</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">mastigow</FONT>). People died on occasion while being flogged this way; frequently it was severe enough to rip a person's body open or cut muscle and sinew to the bone.

Although a few scholars have suggested that the situation was at this point so far out of Pilate's control that he really was telling the high priests they could go ahead and crucify a man he had found to be innocent, this seems unlikely. It is far more likely that Pilate's statement should be understood as one of frustration and perhaps sarcasm. This seems to be supported by the context, for the Jewish authorities make no attempt at this point to seize Jesus and crucify him. Rather they continue to pester Pilate to order the crucifixion.<br>

 <a name="fn1822" href="joh.htm#fnB1822"><sup>37</sup></a><b>sn</b> (19:12)  Is the author using the phrase <i>Friend of Caesar</i> in a technical sense, as a title bestowed on people for loyal service to the Emperor, or in a more general sense merely describing a person as loyal to the Emperor? L. Morris (<i>John </i>[NICNT], 798) thinks it is "unlikely" that the title is used in the technical sense, and J. H. Bernard (<i>St. John</i> [ICC], 2:621) argues that the technical sense of the phrase as an official title was not used before the time of Vespasian (A.D. 69-79). But there appears to be significant evidence for much earlier usage. Some of this is given in BAGD 395. E. Bammel ("<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">fivlo" tou' kaivsaro" </FONT>(John 19:12)," <i>TLZ</i> 77 [1952]: 205-10) listed significant and convincing arguments that the official title was indeed in use at the time. Granting that the title was in use during this period, what is the likelihood that it had been bestowed on Pilate? Pilate was of the equestrian order, that is, of lower nobility as opposed to senatorial rank. As such he would have been eligible to receive such an honor. It also appears that the powerful Sejanus was his patron in Rome, and Sejanus held considerable influence with Tiberius. Tacitus (<i>Annals</i> 6.8) quotes Marcus Terentius in his defense before the Senate as saying that close friendship with Sejanus "was in every case a powerful recommendation to the Emperor's friendship." Thus it is possible that Pilate held this honor. Therefore it appears that the Jewish authorities were putting a good deal of psychological pressure on Pilate to convict Jesus. They had, in effect, finally specified the charge against Jesus as treason: "Everyone who makes himself to be king opposes Caesar." If Pilate now failed to convict Jesus the Jewish authorities could complain to Rome that Pilate had released a traitor. This possibility carried more weight with Pilate than might at first be evident: (1) Pilate's record as governor was not entirely above reproach; (2) Tiberius, who lived away from Rome as a virtual recluse on the island of Capri, was known for his suspicious nature, especially toward rivals or those who posed a political threat; and (3) worst of all, Pilate's patron in Rome, Sejanus, had recently come under suspicion of plotting to seize the imperial succession for himself. Sejanus was deposed in October of A.D. 31. It may have been to Sejanus that Pilate owed his appointment in Judea. Pilate was now in a very delicate position. The Jewish authorities may have known something of this and deliberately used it as leverage against him. Whether or not they knew just how potent their veiled threat was, it had the desired effect. Pilate went directly to the judgment seat<i> </i>to pronounce his judgment.<br>

When the note concerning the hour, <i>about noon</i>, is connected with the day, <i>the day of preparation for the Passover</i>, it becomes apparent that Jesus was going to die on the cross at the very time that the Passover lambs were being slain in the temple courts. Exod 12:6 required that the Passover lamb be kept alive until the 14th <i>Nisan</i>, the eve of the Passover, and then slaughtered by the head of the household at twilight (<i>Grk</i> "between the two evenings"). By this time the slaughtering was no longer done by the heads of households, but by the priests in the temple courts. But so many lambs were needed for the tens of thousands of pilgrims who came to Jerusalem to celebrate the feast (some estimates run in excess of 100,000 pilgrims) that the slaughter could not be completed during the evening, and so the rabbis redefined "between the two evenings" as beginning at noon, when the sun began to decline toward the horizon. Thus the priests had the entire afternoon of 14th <i>Nisan</i> in which to complete the slaughter of the Passover lambs. According to the Fourth Gospel, this is the time Jesus was dying on the cross.<br>

According to Matt 27:32 and Mark 15:21, the soldiers forced Simon to take the cross; Luke 23:26 states that the cross was placed on Simon so that it might be carried behind Jesus. A reasonable explanation of all this is that Jesus started out carrying the cross until he was no longer able to do so, at which point Simon was forced to take over.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (19:19)  Mention of the<i> </i>inscription is an important detail, because the inscription would normally give the reason for the execution. It shows that Jesus was executed for claiming to be a king. It was also probably written with irony from the executioners' point of view.<br>

The two verbs should be read as causatives, since it is highly unlikely that the Roman governor would perform either of these actions himself. He ordered them to be done.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (19:19)  John says simply that the <i>notice</i> was <i>fastened to the cross</i>. Luke 23:38 says the inscription was placed "over him" (Jesus), and Matt 27:37 that it was placed over Jesus' head. On the basis of Matthew's statement Jesus' cross is usually depicted as the <i>crux immissa</i>, the cross which has the crossbeam set below the top of the upright beam. The other commonly used type of cross was the <i>crux commissa</i>, which had the crossbeam atop the upright beam. But Matthew's statement is not conclusive, since with the <i>crux commissa </i>the body would have sagged downward enough to allow the placard to be placed above Jesus' head. The placard with Pilate's inscription is mentioned in all the gospels, but for John it was certainly ironic. Jesus really was <i>the King of the Jews</i>, although he was a king rejected by his own people (cf. 1:11). What Pilate's own motivation for placing the title over Jesus was is considerably more obscure. He may have meant this as a final mockery of Jesus himself, but Pilate's earlier mockery of Jesus seemed to be motivated by a desire to gain pity from the Jewish authorities in order to have him released. More likely Pilate saw this as a subtle way of getting back at the Jewish authorities who had pressured him into the execution of one he considered to be an innocent man.<br>

 <a name="fn1862" href="joh.htm#fnB1862"><sup>77</sup></a><b>sn</b> (19:25)  Several women are mentioned, but it is not easy to determine how many. It is not clear whether <i>his mother's sister </i>and <i>Mary the wife of Clopas</i> are to be understood as the same individual (in which case only three women are mentioned: Jesus' mother, her sister Mary, and Mary Magdalene) or as two different individuals (in which case four women are mentioned: Jesus' mother, her sister, Mary Clopas' wife, and Mary Magdalene). It is impossible to be certain, but when John's account is compared to the synoptics it is easier to reconcile the accounts if four women were present than if there were only three. It also seems that if there were four women present, this would have been seen by the author to be in juxtaposition to the four soldiers present who performed the crucifixion, and this may explain the transition from the one incident in 23-24 to the other in 25-27. Finally, if only three were present, this would mean that both Jesus' mother and her sister were named Mary, and this is highly improbable in a Jewish family of that time. If there were four women present, the name of the second, the sister of Jesus' mother, is not mentioned. It is entirely possible that the sister of Jesus' mother mentioned here is to be identified with the woman named Salome mentioned in Mark 15:40 and also with the woman identified as "the mother of the sons of Zebedee" mentioned in Matt 27:56. If so, and if John the Apostle is to be identified as the beloved disciple, then the reason for the omission of the second woman's name becomes clear; she would have been John's own mother, and he consistently omitted direct reference to himself or his brother James or any other members of his family in the Fourth Gospel.<br>
 <a name="fn1863" href="joh.htm#fnB1863"><sup>78</sup></a><b>sn</b> (19:26)  The term <i>Woman</i> is Jesus' normal, polite way of addressing women (Matt 15:28, Luke 13:12; John 4:21; 8:10; 19:26; 20:15; see BAGD 168 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">gunhv</FONT>). But it <i>is</i> unusual for a son to address his mother with this term. The custom in both Hebrew (or Aramaic) and Greek would be for a son to use a qualifying adjective or title. Is there significance in Jesus' use here? Jesus probably used the term here to help establish Mary and the beloved disciple in a new "mother-son" relationship. Someone would soon need to provide for Mary since Jesus, her oldest son, would no longer be alive. By using this term Jesus distanced himself from Mary so the beloved disciple could take his place as her earthly son (cf. John 2:4). See D. A. Carson, <i>John</i>, 617-18, for discussion about symbolic interpretations of this relationship between Mary and the beloved disciple.<br>

The scripture referred to is probably Ps 69:21, "They also gave me gall for my food, and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink." Also suggested, however, is Ps 22:15, "My tongue cleaves to the roof of my mouth, and You (God) lay me in the dust of death." Ps 22:1 reads, "My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?," a statement Jesus makes from the cross in both Matt 27:46 and Mark 15:34. In light of the connection in the Fourth Gospel between thirst and the living water which Jesus offers, it is highly ironic that here Jesus himself, the source of that living water, expresses his thirst. And since 7:39 associates the living water with the Holy Spirit, Jesus' statement here in 19:28 amounts to an admission that at this point he has been forsaken by God (cf.

According to Josephus this law was interpreted in the 1st century to cover the bodies of those who had been crucified (<i>J. W.</i> 4.5.2 [4.317]). Philo of Alexandria also mentions that on occasion, especially at festivals, the bodies were taken down and given to relatives to bury (<i>Flaccus </i>10 [83]).

The Greek verb <i>pierced</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">nuvssw</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">nussw</FONT>) can indicate anything from a slight prod to a mortal wound. Probably one of the soldiers gave an exploratory stab to see if the body would jerk. If not, he was really dead. This thrust was hard enough to penetrate the side, since the author states that <i>blood and water flowed out immediately</i>.<br>
 <a name="fn1883" href="joh.htm#fnB1883"><sup>98</sup></a><b>sn</b> (19:34)  How is the reference to the <i>blood and water</i> that flowed out from Jesus' side to be understood? This is probably to be connected with the statements in 1 John 5:6-8. In both passages <i>water</i>, <i>blood</i>, and <i>testimony</i> are mentioned. The Spirit is also mentioned in 1 John 5:7 as the source of the testimony, while here the testimony comes from one of the disciples (19:35). The connection between the Spirit and the living water with Jesus' statement of thirst just before he died in the preceding context has already been noted (see 19:28). For the author, the water which flowed out of Jesus' side was a symbolic reference to the Holy Spirit who could now be given because Jesus was now glorified (cf. 7:39); Jesus had now departed and returned to that glory which he had with the Father before the creation of the world (cf. 17:5). The mention of <i>blood</i> recalls the motif of the Passover lamb as a sacrificial victim. Later references to sacrificial procedures in the Mishnah appear to support this: <i>m. Pesahim</i> 5:3 and 5:5 state that the blood of the sacrificial animal should not be allowed to congeal but should flow forth freely at the instant of death so that it could be used for sprinkling; <i>m. Tamid</i> 4:2 actually specifies that the priest is to pierce the heart of the sacrificial victim and cause the blood to come forth.<br>

A few verses later in 13:1 Yahweh (typically rendered as "LORD" in the OT) says "In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity." The blood which flowed from Jesus' pierced side may well be what the author saw as the connection here, since as the shedding of the blood of the sacrificial victim it represents cleansing from sin. Although the Jewish authorities and Roman soldiers certainly "<i>looked on the one whom they have pierced</i>" as he hung on the cross, the author may also have in mind the <i>parousia</i> (second coming) here.

The synoptic accounts all mention other women who accompanied her (although Mary Magdalene is always mentioned first). Why John does not mention the other women is not clear, but Mary probably becomes the focus of the author's attention because it was she who came and found Peter and the beloved disciple and informed them of the empty tomb (20:2). Mary's use of the plural in v. 2 indicates there were others present, in indirect agreement with the synoptic accounts.<br>

But the verse does not actually say anything about John's age, nor is age always directly correlated with running speed.<br>

The author does not state exactly where the linen wrappings were lying. Sometimes the phrase has been translated "lying on the ground," but the implication is that the wrappings were lying where the body had been. The most probable configuration for a tomb of this sort would be to have a niche carved in the wall where the body would be laid lengthwise, or a low shelf like a bench running along one side of the tomb, across the back or around all three sides in a U-shape facing the entrance. Thus the graveclothes would have been lying on this shelf or in the niche where the body had been.<br>

 <a name="fn1918" href="joh.htm#fnB1918"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:7)  The word translated <i>face cloth</i> is a Latin loanword (<i>sudarium</i>). It was a small towel used to wipe off perspiration (the way a handkerchief would be used today). This particular item was not mentioned in connection with Jesus' burial in John 19:40, probably because this was only a brief summary account. A face cloth was mentioned in connection with Lazarus' burial (John 11:44) and was probably customary. R. E. Brown speculates that it was wrapped under the chin and tied on top of the head to prevent the mouth of the corpse from falling open (<i>John </i>[AB], 2:986), but this is not certain.<br>
 <a name="fn1919" href="joh.htm#fnB1919"><sup>12</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:7)  Much dispute and difficulty surrounds the translation of the words <i>not lying with the strips of linen cloth but rolled up in a place by itself</i>. Basically the issue concerns the positioning of the graveclothes as seen by Peter and the other disciple when they entered the tomb. Some have sought to prove that when the disciples saw the graveclothes they were arranged just as they were when around the body, so that when the resurrection took place the resurrected body of Jesus passed through them without rearranging or disturbing them. In this case the reference to the <i>face cloth </i>being rolled up does not refer to its being folded, but collapsed in the shape it had when wrapped around the head. Sometimes in defense of this view the Greek preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">metav</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">meta</FONT>, which normally means "with") is said to mean "like" so that the comparison with the other graveclothes does not involve the location of the face cloth<i> </i>but rather its condition (rolled up rather than flattened). In spite of the intriguing nature of such speculations, it seems more probable that the phrase describing the face cloth should be understood to mean it was separated from the other graveclothes in a different place inside the tomb. This seems consistent with the different conclusions reached by Peter and the beloved disciple (vv. 8-10). All that the condition of the graveclothes indicated was that the body of Jesus had not been stolen by thieves. Anyone who had come to remove the body (whether the authorities or anyone else) would not have bothered to unwrap it before carrying it off. And even if one could imagine that they had (perhaps in search of valuables such as rings or jewelry still worn by the corpse) they would certainly not have bothered to take time to roll up the face cloth and leave the other wrappings in an orderly fashion.<br>
 <a name="fn1920" href="joh.htm#fnB1920"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:8)  What was it that the beloved disciple <i>believed</i> (since v. 7 describes what he <i>saw</i>)? Sometimes it is suggested that what he believed was Mary Magdalene's report that the body had been stolen. But this could hardly be the case; the way the entire scene is narrated such a trivial conclusion would amount to an anticlimax. It is true that the use of the plural "<i>they</i>" in the following verse applied to both Peter and the beloved disciple, and this appears to be a difficulty if one understands that the beloved disciple believed at this point in Jesus' resurrection. But it is not an insuperable difficulty, since all it affirms is that at this time neither Peter nor the beloved disciple had understood the <i>scripture</i> concerning the resurrection. Thus it appears the author intends his reader to understand that when the beloved disciple entered the tomb after Peter and saw the state of the graveclothes, he believed in the resurrection, i.e., that Jesus had risen from the dead.<br>

But what is the significance of the inclusion of this statement by the author? It is often taken to mean that Jesus, when he entered the room, passed through the closed doors. This may well be the case, but it may be assuming too much about our knowledge of the mode in which the resurrected body of Jesus exists. The text does not explicitly state how Jesus got through the closed doors. It is possible to assume that the doors opened of their own accord before him, or that he simply appeared in the middle of the room without passing through the doors at all. The point the author makes here is simply that the closed doors were no obstacle at all to the resurrected Jesus.<br>

This time, however, it is Jesus who is breathing the breath-Spirit of eternal life, life from above, into his disciples (cf. 3:3-10). Furthermore there is the imagery of Ezek 37:1-14, the prophecy concerning the resurrection of the dry bones: in 37:9 the Son of Man is told to prophesy to the "wind-breath-Spirit" to come and breathe on the corpses, so that they will live again. In 37:14 the Lord promised, "I will put my Spirit within you, and you will come to life, and I will place you in your own land." In terms of ultimate fulfillment the passage in Ezek 37 looks at the regeneration of Israel immediately prior to the establishment of the messianic kingdom. The author saw in what Jesus did for the disciples at this point a partial and symbolic fulfillment of Ezekiel's prophecy, much as Peter made use of the prophecy of Joel 2:28-32 in his sermon on the day of Pentecost as recorded in Acts 2:17-21. What then did Jesus do for the disciples in John 20:22? It appears that in light of the symbolism of the new creation present here, as well as the regeneration symbolism from the Ezek 37 passage, that Jesus at this point breathed into the disciples the breath of eternal life. This was in the form of the Holy Spirit, who was to indwell them. It is instructive to look again at 7:38-39, which states, "Just as the scripture says, `Out from within him will flow rivers of living water.' (Now he said this about the Spirit whom those who believed in him were going to receive; for the Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.") But now in 20:22 Jesus was glorified, so the Spirit could be given. Had the disciples not believed in Jesus before? It seems clear that they had, since their belief is repeatedly affirmed, beginning with 2:11. But it also seems clear that even on the eve of the crucifixion, they did not understand the necessity of the cross (16:31-33). And even after the crucifixion, the disciples had not realized that there was going to be a resurrection (20:9). Ultimate recognition of who Jesus was appears to have come to them only after the post-resurrection appearances (note the response of Thomas, who was not present at this incident, in v. 28). Finally, what is the relation of this incident in 20:22 to the account of the coming of the Holy Spirit in Acts 2? It appears best to view these as two separate events which have two somewhat different purposes. This was the giving of life itself, which flowed out from within (cf. 7:38-39). The giving of power would occur later, on the day of Pentecost: power to witness and carry out the mission the disciples had been given. (It is important to remember that in the historical unfolding of God's program for the church, these events occurred in a chronological sequence which, after the church has been established, is not repeatable today.)<br>

 <a name="fn1946" href="joh.htm#fnB1946"><sup>39</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:23)  The statement by Jesus about forgive or retaining <i>anyone's sins</i> finds its closest parallel in Matt 16:19 and 18:18. This is probably not referring to apostolic power to forgive or retain the sins of individuals (as it is sometimes understood), but to the "power" of proclaiming this forgiveness which was entrusted to the disciples. This is consistent with the idea that the disciples are to carry on the ministry of Jesus after he has departed from the world and returned to the Father, a theme which occurred in the Farewell Discourse (cf. 15:27, 16:1-4, and 17:18).<br>

Probably the most likely is something between the second and third alternatives. It seems that the second is slightly more likely here, because the context appears confessional. Thomas' statement, while it may have been an exclamation, does in fact confess the faith which he had previously lacked, and Jesus responds to Thomas' statement in the following verse as if it were a confession. With the proclamation by Thomas here, it is difficult to see how any more profound analysis of Jesus' person could be given. It echoes 1:1 and 1:14 together: the Word was God, and the Word became flesh (Jesus of Nazareth). The Fourth Gospel opened with many other titles for Jesus: the Lamb of God (1:29, 36); the Son of God (1:34, 49); Rabbi (1:38); Messiah (1:41); the King of Israel (1:49); the Son of Man (1:51). Now the climax is reached with the proclamation by Thomas, "My Lord and my God," and the reader has come full circle from 1:1, where the author had introduced him to who Jesus was, to 20:28, where the last of the disciples has come to the full realization of who Jesus was. What Jesus had predicted in John 8:28 had come to pass: "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he" (<i>Grk </i>"I am"). By being lifted up in crucifixion (which led in turn to his death, resurrection, and exaltation with the Father) Jesus has revealed his true identity as both Lord (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kuvrio"</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kurios</FONT>], used by the LXX to translate <i>Yahweh</i>) and God (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov"</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">qeos</FONT>], used by the LXX to translate <i>Elohim</i>).<br>

What are these signs the author of the Gospel has in mind? One can only speculate. The author says they were performed in the presence of the disciples, which emphasizes again their role as witnesses (cf. 15:27). The point here is that the author has been selective in his use of material. He has chosen to record those incidents from the life and ministry of Jesus which supported his purpose in writing the Gospel. Much which might be of tremendous interest, but does not directly contribute to that purpose in writing, he has omitted. The author explains his purpose in writing in the following verse.<br>

Both textual variants enjoy significant MS support, and on both external and internal grounds it is hard to decide which is more likely the original. However, since elsewhere in the Gospel of John both aorist and present tense alike can refer to both initial faith and continuation in the faith, it is highly unlikely that the distinction here would be determinative for the purpose of the Fourth Gospel. The question of purpose cannot be resolved by choosing one textual variant over the other in 20:31, but must be decided on other factors.<br>

 <a name="fn1969" href="joh.htm#fnB1969"><sup>62</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:31)  <i>John 20:31. </i>A major question concerning this verse, the purpose statement of the Gospel of John, is whether the author is writing primarily for an audience of unbelievers, with purely evangelistic emphasis, or whether he envisions an audience of believers, whom he wants to strengthen in their faith. Several points are important in this discussion: (1) in the immediate context (20:30), the other signs spoken of by the author were performed in the presence of disciples; (2) in the case of the first of the signs, at Cana, the author makes a point of the effect the miracle had on the disciples (2:11); (3) if the primary thrust of the Gospel is toward unbelievers, it is difficult to see why so much material in chaps. 13-17 (the last meal and Farewell Discourse, concluding with Jesus' prayer for the disciples), which deals almost exclusively with the disciples, is included; (4) the disciples themselves were repeatedly said to have believed in Jesus throughout the Gospel, beginning with 2:11, yet they still needed to believe after the resurrection (if Thomas' experience in 20:27-28 is any indication); and (5) the Gospel appears to be written with the assumption that the readers are familiar with the basic story (or perhaps with one or more of the synoptic gospel accounts, although this is less clear). Thus no account of the birth of Jesus is given at all, and although he is identified as being from Nazareth, the words of the Pharisees and chief priests to Nicodemus (7:52) are almost certainly to be taken as ironic, assuming the reader knows where Jesus was really from. Likewise, when Mary is identified in 11:2 as the one who anointed Jesus' feet with oil, it is apparently assumed that the readers are familiar with the story, since the incident involved is not mentioned in the Fourth Gospel until 12:3. These observations must be set over against the clear statement of purpose in the present verse, 20:31, which seems to have significant evangelistic emphasis. In addition to this there is the repeated emphasis on witness throughout the Fourth Gospel (cf. the witness of John the Baptist in 1:7, 8, 15, 32, and 34, along with 5:33; the Samaritan woman in 4:39; Jesus' own witness, along with that of the Father who sent him, in 8:14, 18, and 18:37; the disciples themselves in 15:27; and finally the testimony of the author himself in 19:35 and 21:24). In light of all this evidence it seems best to say that the author wrote with a dual purpose: (1) to witness to unbelievers concerning Jesus, in order that they come to believe in him and have eternal life; and (2) to strengthen the faith of believers, by deepening and expanding their understanding of who Jesus is.<br>

 <a name="fn1987" href="joh.htm#fnB1987"><sup>18</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:7)  This is a parenthetical note by the author. Peter's behavior here has been puzzling to many interpreters. It is usually understood that the Greek word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">gumnov"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">gumnos</FONT>, usually translated "naked") does not refer to complete nudity (as it could), since this would have been offensive to Jewish sensibilities. It is thus commonly understood to mean "stripped for work" here, that is, with one's outer clothing removed, and Peter was wearing either a loincloth or a loose-fitting tunic (a long shirt-like garment worn under a cloak). Believing himself inadequately clad to greet the Lord, Peter threw his <i>outer garment</i> around himself and dived into the sea. C. K. Barrett (<i>St. John, </i>580-81) offered the explanation that a greeting was a religious act and thus could not be performed unless one was clothed. This still leaves the improbable picture of a person with much experience around the water putting on his outer garment before diving in. R. E. Brown's suggestion (<i>John </i>[AB], 2:1072) seems much more probable here: the Greek verb used (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">diazwvnnumi</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">diazwnnumi</FONT>) does not necessarily mean putting clothing on, but rather tying the clothing around oneself (the same verb is used in 13:4-5 of Jesus tying the towel around himself). The statement that Peter was "naked" could just as well mean that he was naked underneath the <i>outer garment</i>, and thus could not take it off before jumping into the water. But he did pause to tuck it up and tie it with the girdle before jumping in, to allow himself more freedom of movement. Thus the clause that states Peter was naked is explanatory (note the use of <i>for</i>), explaining why Peter girded up his outer garment rather than taking it off--he had nothing on underneath it.<br>

 <a name="fn1994" href="joh.htm#fnB1994"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:11)  Here the author makes two further points about the catch of fish: (1) there were <i>one hundred fifty-three</i> large fish in the net, and (2) even with so many, <i>the net was not torn</i>. Many symbolic interpretations have been proposed for both points (unity, especially, in the case of the second), but the reader is given no explicit clarification in the text itself. It seems better not to speculate here, but to see these details as indicative of an eyewitness account. Both are the sort of thing that would remain in the mind of a person who had witnessed them firsthand. For a summary of the symbolic interpretations proposed for the number of fish in the net, see R. E. Brown (<i>John </i>[AB], 2:1074-75), where a number are discussed at length. Perhaps the reader is simply to understand this as the abundance which results from obedience to Jesus, much as with the amount of wine generated in the water jars in Cana at the beginning of Jesus' public ministry (2:6).<br>

 <a name="fn1996" href="joh.htm#fnB1996"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:15)  To whom (or what) does "these" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">touvtwn</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">toutwn</FONT>) refer? Three possibilities are suggested: (1) <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">touvtwn</FONT> should be understood as neuter, "these things," referring to the boats, nets, and fishing gear nearby. In light of Peter's statement in 21:3, "I am going fishing," some have understood Peter to have renounced his commission in light of his denials of Jesus. Jesus, as he restores Peter and forgives him for his denials, is asking Peter if he really loves his previous vocation more than he loves Jesus. Three things may be said in evaluation of this view: (a) it is not at all necessary to understand Peter's statement in 21:3 as a renouncement of his discipleship, as this view of the meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">touvtwn</FONT> would imply; (b) it would probably be more likely that the verb would be repeated in such a construction (see 7:31 for an example where the verb is repeated); and (c) as R. E. Brown has observed (<i>John </i>[AB], 2:1103) by Johannine standards the choice being offered to Peter between material things and the risen Jesus would seem rather ridiculous, especially after the disciples had realized whom it was they were dealing with (the Lord, see v. 12). (2) <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">touvtwn</FONT> refers to the other disciples, meaning "Do you love me more than you love these other disciples?" The same objection mentioned as (c) under (1) would apply here: could the author, in light of the realization of who Jesus is which has come to the disciples after the resurrection, and which he has just mentioned in 21:12, seriously present Peter as being offered a choice between the other disciples and the risen Jesus? This leaves option (3), that <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">touvtwn</FONT> refers to the other disciples, meaning "Do you love me more than these other disciples do?" It seems likely that there is some irony here: Peter had boasted in 13:37, "I will lay down my life for you," and the synoptics present Peter as boasting even more explicitly of his loyalty to Jesus ("Even if they all fall away, I will not," Matt 26:33; Mark 14:29). Thus the semantic force of what Jesus asks Peter here amounts to something like "Now, after you have denied me three times, as I told you you would, can you still affirm that you love me more than these other disciples do?" The addition of the auxiliary verb "do" in the translation is used to suggest to the English reader the third interpretation, which is the preferred one.<br>

 <a name="fn1998" href="joh.htm#fnB1998"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:15)  Is there a significant difference in meaning between the two words for love used in the passage, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajgapavw</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">filevw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">agapaw </FONT>and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">filew</FONT>)? Aside from Origen, who saw a distinction in the meaning of the two words, most of the Greek Fathers like Chrysostom and Cyril of Alexandria, saw no real difference of meaning. Neither did Augustine nor the translators of the Itala (Old Latin). This was also the view of the Reformation Greek scholars Erasmus and Grotius. The suggestion that a distinction in meaning should be seen comes primarily from a number of British scholars of the 19th century, especially Trench, Westcott, and Plummer. It has been picked up by others such as Spicq, Lenski, and Hendriksen. But most modern scholars decline to see a real difference in the meaning of the two words in this context, among them Bernard, Moffatt, Bonsirven, Bultmann, Barrett, Brown, Morris, Haenchen, and Beasley-Murray. There are three significant reasons for seeing no real difference in the meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajgapavw</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">filevw</FONT> in these verses: (1) the author has a habit of introducing slight stylistic variations in repeated material without any significant difference in meaning (compare, for example, 3:3 with 3:5, and 7:34 with 13:33). An examination of the uses of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajgapavw</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">filevw</FONT> in the Fourth Gospel seems to indicate a general interchangeability between the two. Both terms are used of God's love for man (3:16, 16:27); of the Father's love for the Son (3:35, 5:20); of Jesus' love for men (11:5, 11:3); of the love of men for men (13:34, 15:19); and of the love of men for Jesus (8:42, 16:27). (2) If (as seems probable) the original conversation took place in Aramaic (or possibly Hebrew), there would not have been any difference expressed because both Aramaic and Hebrew have only one basic word for love. In the LXX both <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajgapavw</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">filevw</FONT> are used to translate the same Hebrew word for love, although <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajgapavw</FONT> is more frequent. It is significant that in the Syriac version of the NT only one verb is used to translate vv. 15-17 (Syriac is very similar linguistically to Palestinian Aramaic). (3) Peter's answers to the questions asked with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajgapavw</FONT> are `yes' even though he answers using the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">filevw</FONT>. If he is being asked to love Jesus on a higher or more spiritual level his answers give no indication of this, and one would be forced to say (in order to maintain a consistent distinction between the two verbs) that Jesus finally concedes defeat and accepts only the lower form of love which is all that Peter is capable of offering. Thus it seems best to regard the interchange between <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajgapavw</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">filevw</FONT> in these verses as a minor stylistic variation of the author, consistent with his use of minor variations in repeated material elsewhere, and not indicative of any real difference in meaning. Thus no attempt has been made to distinguish between the two Greek words in the translation.<br>

 <a name="fn2016" href="joh.htm#fnB2016"><sup>47</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:19)  This is a parenthetical note by the author. The phrase <i>by what kind of death Peter was going to glorify God </i>almost certainly indicates martyrdom (cf. 1 Pet 4:16), and it may not predict anything more than that. But the parallelism of this phrase to similar phrases in John 12:33 and 18:32 which describe Jesus' own death by crucifixion have led many to suggest that the picture Jesus is portraying for Peter looks not just at martyrdom but at death by crucifixion. This seems to be confirmed by the phrase <i>you will stretch out your hands </i>in the preceding verse. There is some evidence that the early church understood this and similar phrases (one of them in Isa 65:2) to refer to crucifixion (for a detailed discussion of the evidence see L. Morris, <i>John </i>[NICNT], 876, n. 52). Some have objected that if this phrase does indeed refer to crucifixion, the order within v. 18 is wrong, because the stretching out of the hands in crucifixion precedes the binding and leading where one does not wish to go. R. E. Brown (<i>John </i>[AB], 2:1108) sees this as a deliberate reversal of the normal order (<i>hysteron proteron</i>) intended to emphasize the stretching out of the hands. Another possible explanation for the unusual order is the Roman practice in crucifixions of tying the condemned prisoner's arms to the crossbeam (<i>patibulum</i>) and forcing him to carry it to the place of execution (W. Bauer as cited by O. Cullmann in <i>Peter: Disciple, Apostle, Martyr</i>, 88).<br>

This is clearly hyperbole, and as such bears some similarity to the conclusion of the Book of Ecclesiastes (12:9-12).

The statement in v. 25 serves as a final reminder that knowledge of Jesus, no matter how well-attested it may be, is still partial. Everything that Jesus did during his three and one-half years of earthly ministry is not known. This supports the major theme of the Fourth Gospel: Jesus is repeatedly identified as God, and although he may be truly known on the basis of his self-disclosure, he can never be known exhaustively. There is far more to know about Jesus than could ever be written down, or even known. On this appropriate note the Gospel of John ends.
