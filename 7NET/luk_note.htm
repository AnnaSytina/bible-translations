 <b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Grk</i> "Since" or "Because." This begins a long sentence that extends through v. 4. Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence and the tendency of contemporary English style to use shorter sentences, the Greek sentence has been divided up into shorter English sentences in the translation.<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="luk.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  This is sometimes translated "narrative," but the term itself can refer to an oral or written account. It is the verb "undertaken" which suggests a written account, since it literally is "to set one's hand" to something (BAGD 304 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejpiceirevw</FONT>). "Narrative" is too specific, denoting a particular genre of work for the accounts that existed in the earlier tradition. Not all of that material would have been narrative.<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="luk.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  Or "events."<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="luk.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  Or "have been accomplished." Given Luke's emphasis on divine design (e.g., Luke 24:43-47) a stronger sense ("fulfilled") is better than a mere reference to something having taken place ("accomplished").<br>
 <a name="fn4" href="luk.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  <i>Grk</i> "even as"; this compares the recorded tradition of 1:1 with the original eyewitness tradition of 1:2.<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="luk.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  Or "delivered."<br>
 <a name="fn6" href="luk.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:2)  The phrase <i>eyewitnesses and servants of the word</i> refers to a single group of people who faithfully passed on the accounts about Jesus. The language about delivery (<i>passed on</i>) points to accounts faithfully passed on to the early church.<br>
 <a name="fn7" href="luk.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  <i>Grk</i> "like the accounts those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word passed on to us." The location of "in the beginning" in the Greek shows that the tradition is rooted in those who were with Jesus from the start.<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="luk.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  This is supplied in the translation to surface the force of a sentence the translation divides up because of English style. Luke is joining a tradition with good precedent here.<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="luk.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:3)  Three later Latin MSS (b g<sup>1</sup> q) add "and to the Holy Spirit," a reading that is certainly not original, but reflects later views on the process of inspiration.<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="luk.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:3)  When Luke says <i>it seemed good to me as well </i>he is not being critical of the earlier accounts, but sees himself stepping into a tradition of reporting about Jesus to which he will add uniquely a second volume on the early church when he writes the Book of Acts.<br>
 <a name="fn11" href="luk.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  <i>Grk</i> "having followed"; the participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">parhkolouqhkovti</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">parhkolouqhkoti</FONT>) is translated causally.<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="luk.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:3)  <i>An orderly account</i> does not necessarily mean that all events are recorded in the exact chronological sequence in which they occurred, but that the account produced is an orderly one. This could include, for example, thematic or topical order rather than strict chronological order.<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="luk.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  Or "know the truth about"; or "know the certainty of." The issue of the context is psychological confidence; Luke's work is trying to encourage Theophilus. So in English this is better translated as "know for certain" than "know certainty" or "know the truth," which sounds too cognitive. "Certain" assumes the truth of the report. On this term, see Acts 2:36; 21:34; 22:30; and 25:26. "Have assurance" is also possible here.<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="luk.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  Or "you heard about." This term can refer merely to a report of information (Acts 21:24) or to instruction (Acts 18:25). The scope of Luke as a whole, which calls for perseverance in the faith and which assumes much knowledge of the OT, suggests Theophilus had received some instruction and was probably a believer.<br>
 <a name="fn15" href="luk.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Grk</i> "It happened that in the days." The introductory phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejgevneto</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">egeneto</FONT>, "it happened that") common in Luke (69 times) and Acts (54 times) is redundant in contemporary English and has not been translated.<br>
 <a name="fn16" href="luk.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:5)  <i>Herod </i>was Herod the Great, who ruled Palestine from 37 B.C. until he died in 4 B.C. He was known for his extensive building projects (including the temple in Jerusalem) and for his cruelty.<br>
 <a name="fn17" href="luk.htm#fnB17"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Grk</i> "of"; but the meaning of the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejk</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ek</FONT>) is more accurately expressed in contemporary English by the relative clause "who belonged to."<br>
 <a name="fn18" href="luk.htm#fnB18"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:5)  There were twenty-four divisions of priesthood and <i>the priestly division of Abijah</i> was eighth on the list according to 1 Chr 24:10.<br>
 <a name="fn19" href="luk.htm#fnB19"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Grk</i> "and her name was Elizabeth."<br>
 <a name="fn20" href="luk.htm#fnB20"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Grk</i> "a wife of the daughters of Aaron."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:5)  It was not unusual for a priest to have a wife from a priestly family (<i>a descendant of Aaron</i>); this was regarded as a special blessing.<br>
 <a name="fn21" href="luk.htm#fnB21"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  <i>Grk</i> "And they." Because of the difference between Greek style, which often begins sentences or clauses with "and," and English style, which generally does not, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>) is not translated here.<br>
 <a name="fn22" href="luk.htm#fnB22"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  <i>Grk</i> "walking in" (an idiom for one's lifestyle).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:6)  The description of Zechariah and Elizabeth as <i>following... blamelessly </i>was not to say that they were sinless, but that they were faithful and pious. Thus a practical righteousness is meant here (Gen 6:8; Deut 28:9).<br>
 <a name="fn23" href="luk.htm#fnB23"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  The predicate adjective has the effect of an adverb here (BDF &#167;243).<br>
 <a name="fn24" href="luk.htm#fnB24"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:7)  <i>Elizabeth was barren. </i>Both Zechariah and Elizabeth are regarded by Luke as <i>righteous in the sight of God, following all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamelessly</i> (v. 6). With this language, reminiscent of various passages in the OT, Luke is probably drawing implicit comparisons to the age and barrenness of such famous OT personalities as Abraham and Sarah (see, e.g., Gen 18:9-15), the mother of Samson (Judg 13:2-5), and Hannah, the mother of Samuel (1 Sam 1:1-20). And, as it was in the case of these OT saints, so it is with Elizabeth: after much anguish and seeking the Lord, she too is going to have a son in her barrenness. In that day it was a great reproach to be childless, for children were a sign of God's blessing (cf. Gen 1:28; Lev 20:20-21; Pss 127 and 128; Jer 22:30). As the dawn of salvation draws near, however, God will change this elderly couple's grief into great joy and grant them the one desire time had rendered impossible.<br>
 <a name="fn25" href="luk.htm#fnB25"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  <i>Grk</i> "were both advanced in days" (an idiom for old age).<br>
 <a name="fn26" href="luk.htm#fnB26"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:8)  <i>Grk</i> "Now it happened that." The introductory phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejgevneto</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">egeneto</FONT>, "it happened that") common in Luke (69 times) and Acts (54 times) is redundant in contemporary English and has not been translated.<br>
 <a name="fn27" href="luk.htm#fnB27"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:8)  <i>Grk</i> "he"; the referent (Zechariah) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn28" href="luk.htm#fnB28"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:8)  <i>Grk</i> "serving as priest in the order of his division before God."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:8)  Zechariah's division would be <i>on duty</i> twice a year for a week at a time.<br>
 <a name="fn29" href="luk.htm#fnB29"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  <i>Grk</i> "according to the custom of the priesthood it fell to him by lot." The order of the clauses has been rearranged in the translation to make it clear that the prepositional phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kataV toV e[qo" th'" iJerateiva"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kata to eqo" th" Jierateia"</FONT>, "according to the custom of the priesthood") modifies the phrase "it fell to him by lot" rather than the preceding clause.<br>
 <a name="fn30" href="luk.htm#fnB30"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  This is an aorist participle and is temporally related to the offering of incense, not to when the lot fell.<br>
 <a name="fn31" href="luk.htm#fnB31"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  Or "temple." Such sacrifices, which included the burning of incense, would have occurred in the holy place according to the Mishnah (<i>m. Tamid</i> 1.2; 3.1; 5-7). A priest would have given this sacrifice, which was offered for the nation, once in one's career. It would be offered either at 9 a.m. or 3 p.m., since it was made twice a day.<br>
 <a name="fn32" href="luk.htm#fnB32"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  <i>Grk</i> "And," but "now" better represents the somewhat parenthetical nature of this statement in the flow of the narrative.<br>
 <a name="fn33" href="luk.htm#fnB33"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  <i>Grk</i> "all the multitude." While "assembly" is sometimes used here to translate <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">plh'qo"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">plhqo"</FONT>), that term usually implies in English a specific or particular group of people. However, this was simply a large group gathered outside, which was not unusual, especially for the afternoon offering.<br>
 <a name="fn34" href="luk.htm#fnB34"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  The "hour of the incense offering" is another way to refer to the time of sacrifice.<br>
 <a name="fn35" href="luk.htm#fnB35"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  <i>Grk</i> "And an angel." Because of the difference between Greek style, which often begins sentences or clauses with "and," and English style, which generally does not, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dev</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">de</FONT>) is not translated here.<br>
 <a name="fn36" href="luk.htm#fnB36"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  Or "the angel of the Lord." Linguistically, "angel of the Lord" is the same in both testaments (and thus, he is either "an angel of the Lord" or "the angel of the Lord" in both testaments). For arguments and implications, see D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax</i>, 252; M. J. Davidson, "Angels," <i>DJG</i>, 9; W. G. MacDonald argues for "an angel" in both testaments: "Christology and `The Angel of the Lord'," 324-35. <br>
 <a name="fn37" href="luk.htm#fnB37"><sup>38</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:11)  This term is often used to describe a supernatural appearance (24:34; Acts 2:3; 7:2, 30, 35; 9:17; 13:31; 16:9; 26:16).<br>
 <a name="fn38" href="luk.htm#fnB38"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:12)  The words "the angel" are not in the Greek text, but are implied. Direct objects were frequently omitted in Greek when clear from the context.<br>
 <a name="fn39" href="luk.htm#fnB39"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:12)  Or "and he was afraid"; <i>Grk</i> "fear fell upon him." Fear is common when supernatural agents appear (1:29-30, 65; 2:9; 5:8-10; 9:34; 24:38; Exod 15:16; Judg 6:22-23; 13:6, 22; 2 Sam 6:9).<br>
 <a name="fn40" href="luk.htm#fnB40"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13)  The passive means that the prayer was heard by God.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:13)  <i>Your prayer has been heard. </i>Zechariah's prayer while offering the sacrifice would have been for the nation, but the answer to the prayer also gave them a long hoped-for child, a hope they had abandoned because of their old age.<br>
 <a name="fn41" href="luk.htm#fnB41"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13)  <i>Grk</i> "a son, and you"; <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>) has not been translated. Instead a semicolon is used in the translation for stylistic reasons.<br>
 <a name="fn42" href="luk.htm#fnB42"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:13) <i>Grk</i> "you will call his name John." The future tense here functions like a command (see D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax</i>, 569-70). This same construction occurs in v. 31.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:13)  "<i>Do not be afraid...you must call his name John.</i>"<i> </i>This is a standard birth announcement (see Gen 16:11; Isa 7:14; Matt 1:21; Luke 1:31).<br>
 <a name="fn43" href="luk.htm#fnB43"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:14)  <i>Grk</i> "This will be joy and gladness."<br>
 <a name="fn44" href="luk.htm#fnB44"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:14)  Or "because of."<br>
 <a name="fn45" href="luk.htm#fnB45"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:14)  "At his birth" is more precise as the grammatical subject (1:58), though "at his coming" is a possible force, since it is his mission, as the following verses note, that will really bring joy.<br>
 <a name="fn46" href="luk.htm#fnB46"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:15)  <i>Grk</i> "before."<br>
 <a name="fn47" href="luk.htm#fnB47"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:15)  Some later MSS (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Q Y</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Euml;</FONT><sup>13</sup> 700 1424 <i>al</i>) read "before God." Most MSS support the reading "before the Lord" here, which is almost certainly the original reading.<br>
 <a name="fn48" href="luk.htm#fnB48"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:15)  <i>Grk</i> "and he"; because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, the conjunction <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>) has not been translated here. Instead a new English sentence is begun in the translation.<br>
 <a name="fn49" href="luk.htm#fnB49"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:15)  <i>Grk</i> "even from his mother's womb." While this idiom may be understood to refer to the point of birth ("even from his birth"), Luke 1:41 suggests that here it should be understood to refer to a time before birth.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:15)  <i>He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even before his birth. </i>This is the language of the birth of a prophet (Judg 13:5, 7; Isa 49:1; Jer 1:5; Sir 49:7); see 1:41 for the first fulfillment.<br>
 <a name="fn50" href="luk.htm#fnB50"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:16)  <i>Grk</i> "And he." Here <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>) is not translated because of differences between Greek and English style.<br>
 <a name="fn51" href="luk.htm#fnB51"><sup>52</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:16)  The word translated <i>will turn</i> is a good summary term for repentance and denotes John's call to a change of direction (Luke 3:1-14).<br>
 <a name="fn52" href="luk.htm#fnB52"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:16)  <i>Grk</i> "sons"; but clearly this is a generic reference to people of both genders.<br>

Mary seems to have sensed that the declaration had an element of immediacy to it that excluded Joseph. Many modern translations render this phrase "since I am a virgin," but the Greek word for virgin is not used in the text, and the euphemistic expression is really more explicit, referring specifically to sexual relations.<br>

The wording of this phrase depends on whether the adjective is a predicate adjective, as in the text, or is an adjective modifying the participle serving as the subject. The absence of an article with the adjective speaks for a predicate position. Other less appealing options supply a verb for "holy"; thus "the one who is born will be holy"; or argue that both "holy" and "Son of God" are predicates, so "The one who is born will be called holy, the Son of God."<br>

These terms are used broadly to refer to the genre of writing, not to the content. There are two broad criteria for determining if a passage is poetic or hymnic: "(a) <i>stylistic:</i> a certain rhythmical lilt when the passages are read aloud, the presence of <i>parallelismus membrorum</i> (i.e., an arrangement into couplets), the semblance of some metre, and the presence of rhetorical devices such as alliteration, <i>chiasmus</i>, and antithesis; and (b) <i>linguistic: </i>an unusual vocabulary, particularly the presence of theological terms, which is different from the surrounding context" (P. T. O'Brien, <i>Philippians </i>[NIGTC], 188-9). Classifying a passage as hymnic or poetic is important because understanding this genre can provide keys to interpretation. However, not all scholars agree that the above criteria are present in this passage, so the decision to typeset it as poetry should be viewed as a tentative decision about its genre.<br>

Mary praises God and then tells why both in terms of his care for her (vv. 46-49) and for others, including Israel (vv. 50-55). Its traditional name, the "<i>Magnificat</i>," comes from the Latin for the phrase <i>My soul magnifies the Lord</i> at the hymn's start.<br>

However, it has been suggested by various scholars that Joseph and Mary were staying with relatives in Bethlehem (e.g., C. S. Keener, <i>Bible Background Commentary</i>, 194; B. Witherington, "Birth of Jesus," <i>DJG</i>, 69-70); if that were so the term would refer to the guest room in the relatives' house, which would have been filled beyond capacity with all the other relatives who had to journey to Bethlehem for the census.<br>

December 25 as the celebrated date of Jesus' birth arose around the time of Constantine (c. A.D. 306-337), though it is mentioned in material from Hippolytus (A.D. 165-235). Some think that the reason for celebration on this date was that it coincided with the pagan Roman festival of Saturnalia, and Christians could celebrate their own festival at this time without fear of persecution. On the basis of the statement that the shepherds were <i>out in the field, keeping guard over their flock by night</i> it is often suggested that Jesus' birth took place in early spring, since it was only at lambing time that shepherds stood guard over their flocks in the field.

Some copyists, aware that the purification law applied to women only, produced MSS (76 it<sup>pt</sup> vg [though the Latin word <i>eius </i>could be either masculine or feminine]) that read "her purification." But the extant evidence for an unambiguous "her" is shut up to one late minuscule (codex 76) and a couple of patristic citations of dubious worth (Pseudo-Athanasius whose date is unknown, and the <i>Catenae</i> <i>in euangelia Lucae et Joannis</i>, edited by J. A. Cramer. The <i>Catenae</i> is a work of collected patristic sayings whose exact source is unknown [thus, it could come from a period covering hundreds of years]). A few other witnesses (D <i>et pauci</i>) read "his purification." The KJV has "her purification," following Beza's Greek text (essentially a revision of Erasmus'). Erasmus did not have it in any of his five editions. Most likely Beza put in the feminine form <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aujth'"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">auths</FONT>) because, recognizing that the <i>eius </i>found in several Latin MSS could be read either as a masculine or a feminine, he made the contextually more satisfying choice of the feminine.

So the evidence for the feminine singular is virtually nonexistent, while the masculine singular <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aujtou'</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">autou</FONT>) was a clear scribal blunder.

 <a name="fn339" href="luk.htm#fnB339"><sup>91</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:32)  The syntax of this verse is disputed. Most read "light" and "glory" in parallelism, so Jesus is a light for revelation to the Gentiles and is glory to the people for Israel. Others see "light" (1:78-79) as a summary, while "revelation" and "glory" are parallel, so Jesus is light for all, but is revelation for the Gentiles and glory for Israel. Both readings make good sense and either could be correct, but Luke 1:78-79 and Acts 26:22-23 slightly favor this second option.<br>

The MT favors taking it with "Prepare a way," while the LXX takes it with "a voice crying out." If the former, the meaning would be that such preparation should be done "in the wilderness." If the latter, the meaning would be that the place from where John's ministry went forth was "in the wilderness." There are Jewish materials that support both renderings: 1QS 8:14 and 9.19-20 support the MT while certain rabbinic texts favor the LXX (see D. L. Bock, <i>Luke</i> [BECNT], 1:290-91). While it is not absolutely necessary that a call in the wilderness led to a response in the wilderness, it is not unlikely that such would be the case. Thus, in the final analysis, the net effect between the two choices may be minimal. In any case, a majority of commentators and translations take "in the wilderness" with "The voice of one crying" (D. L. Bock; R. H. Stein, <i>Luke</i> [NAC], 129; I. H. Marshall, <i>Luke</i> [NIGTC], 136; NIV, NRSV, NKJV, NLT, NASB, REB).<br>
 <a name="fn428" href="luk.htm#fnB428"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:4)  This call to "make paths straight" in this context is probably an allusion to preparation through repentance as the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">poievw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">poiew</FONT>) reappears in vv. 8, 10, 11, 12, 14.<br>

 <a name="fn439" href="luk.htm#fnB439"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:8)  <i>We have Abraham as our father. </i>John's warning to the crowds really assumes two things: (1) A number of John's listeners apparently believed that simply by their physical descent from Abraham, they were certain heirs of the promises made to the patriarch, and (2) God would never judge his covenant people lest he inadvertently place the fulfillment of his promises in jeopardy. In light of this, John tells these people two things: (1) they need to repent and produce fruit in keeping with repentance, for only that saves from the coming wrath, and (2) God will raise up "children for Abraham from these stones" if he wants to. Their disobedience will not threaten the realization of God's sovereign purposes.<br>
 <a name="fn440" href="luk.htm#fnB440"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:8) <i> </i>The point of the statement <i>God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham</i> is that ancestry or association with a tradition tied to the great founder of the Jewish nation is not an automatic source of salvation.<br>

The image of "fire" serves to further heighten the intensity of the judgment referred to. It is John's way of summoning all people to return to God with all their heart and avoid his unquenchable wrath soon to be poured out. John's language and imagery is probably ultimately drawn from the OT where Israel is referred to as a fruitless vine (Hos 10:1-2; Jer 2:21-22) and the image of an "ax" is used to indicate God's judgment (Psa 74:5-6; Jer 46:22).<br>

The name for this garment (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">citwvn</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">citwn</FONT>) presents some difficulty in translation. Most modern readers would not understand what a `tunic' was any more than they would be familiar with a `<i>chiton</i>.' On the other hand, attempts to find a modern equivalent are also a problem: "shirt" conveys the idea of a much shorter garment that covers only the upper body, and "undergarment" (given the styles of modern underwear) is more misleading still. "Tunic" was therefore employed, but with a note to explain its nature.<br>

The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">diaseivshte</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">diaseishte</FONT>) here refers to "shaking someone." In this context it refers to taking financial advantage of someone through violence, so it refers essentially to robbery. Soldiers are to perform their tasks faithfully. A changed person is to carry out his tasks in life faithfully and without grumbling. <br>

 <b>sn</b> (3:16)  The humility of John is evident in the statement <i>I am not worthy</i>. This was considered one of the least worthy tasks of a slave, and John did not consider himself worthy to do even that for the one to come, despite the fact he himself was a prophet!<br>
 <a name="fn464" href="luk.htm#fnB464"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:16)  The term refers to the leather strap or thong used to bind a sandal.

Some see a reference to Spirit baptism and to fire as two distinct works. Against this is the close binding of the two elements by one preposition in the Greek text. The OT background seems to be Isa 4:4-5 and the remark looks to a cleansing and purging the Spirit will perform. The initial fulfillment of this comes in Acts 2, and this work is presented as something that the promised Christ will perform.<br>

In this context, although the word is singular, the English plural "heavens" connotes the Greek better than the singular "heaven" would, for the singular does not normally refer to the sky.<br>
 <a name="fn478" href="luk.htm#fnB478"><sup>64</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:22)  This phrase is a descriptive comparison. The Spirit is not a dove, but descends like one in some type of bodily representation.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (3:22)  The allusions in the remarks of the text recall Ps 2:7a; Isa 42:1 and either Isa 41:8 or, less likely, Gen 22:12,16. God is marking out Jesus as his chosen one (the meaning of "[in you I take] great delight"), but it may well be that this was a private experience that only Jesus and John saw and heard (cf.

Some argue Nathan stresses a prophetic connection, but it is not clear how (through confusion with the prophet Nathan?). Others note the absence of a reference to Jeconiah later, so that here there is a difference to show the canceling out of this line.

The participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">peirazovmeno"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">peirazomeno"</FONT>) has been translated as an adverbial clause in English to avoid a run-on sentence with a second "and."

 <b>sn</b> (4:2)  This verb and its cognate noun, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">sunteleia</FONT>, usually implies not just the end of an event, but its completion or fulfillment. The noun is always used in the NT in eschatological contexts; the verb is often so used (cf. Matt 13:39, 40; 24:3; 28:20; Mark 13:4; Rom 9:28; Heb 8:8; 9:26). The idea here may be that the forty-day period of temptation was <i>designed</i> for a particular purpose in the life of Christ (the same verb is used in v. 13). The cognate verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">teleiow</FONT> is a key NT term for the completion of God's plan: see Luke 12:50; 22:37; John 19:30; and (where it has the additional component of meaning "to perfect") Heb 2:10; 5:8-9; 7:28.<br>

The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tiv hJmi'n kaiV soiv </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ti Jhmin kai soi</FONT>) is Semitic in origin, though it made its way into colloquial Greek (BAGD 217 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejgwv</FONT>). The equivalent Hebrew expression in the Old Testament had two basic meanings: (1) When one person was unjustly bothering another, the injured party could say "What to me and to you?" meaning, "What have I done to you that you should do this to me?" (Judg 11:12; 2 Chr 35:21; 1 Kgs 17:18). (2) When someone was asked to get involved in a matter he felt was no business of his, he could say to the one asking him, "What to me and to you?" meaning, "That is your business, how am I involved?" (2 Kgs 3:13; Hos 14:8). Option (1) implies hostility, while option (2) merely implies disengagement. BAGD suggests the following as glosses for this expression: <i>What have I to do with you? What have we in common? Never mind! Leave me alone! </i>Hostility between Jesus and the demons is certainly to be understood in this context, hence the translation: "Leave me alone...."

 <b>sn</b> (5:10)  The kind of fishing envisioned was net--not line--fishing, which involved a circular net that had heavy weights around its perimeter. The occupation of fisherman was labor-intensive. The imagery of using a lure and a line (and waiting for the fish to strike) is thus foreign to this text. Rather, the imagery of a fisherman involved much strain, long hours, and often little results. Jesus' point may have been one or more of the following: the strenuousness of evangelism, the work ethic that it required, persistence and dedication to the task (often in spite of minimal results), the infinite value of the new "catch" (viz., people), and perhaps an eschatological theme of snatching people from judgment (cf. W. L. Lane, <i>Mark</i> [NICNT], 67; D. L. Bock, <i>Luke</i> [BECNT], 1:461). If this last motif is in view, then catching people is the opposite of catching fish: the fish would be caught, killed, cooked, and eaten; people would be caught so as to remove them from eternal destruction and to give them new life. With the statement "<i>You will be catching people</i>" Jesus turns the miracle into a metaphor for mission. <br>

While the verb can refer to normal "reasoning," "discussion," or "reflection" in the NT, its use here in Luke 5:22, alongside the noun--which is regularly used with a negative sense in the NT (cf. Matt 15:19; Mark 7:21; Luke 2:35, 6:8, 9:47; Rom 1:21; 1 Cor 3:20; G. Schrenk, <i>TDNT </i>2:96-97; D. Bock, <i>Luke</i> [BECNT], 1:484)--suggests the idea of "contention."

It is Jesus' favorite way to refer to himself. Jesus did not reveal the background of the term here, which mixes human and divine imagery as the man in Daniel rides a cloud, something only God does. He just used it. It also could be an idiom in Aramaic meaning either "some person" or "me." So there is a little ambiguity in its use here, since its origin is not clear at this point.

The loaves were placed on a table in the holy place of the tabernacle, on the north side opposite the lampstand (Exod 26:35). It was the duty of the priest each Sabbath to place fresh bread on the table; the loaves from the previous week were then given to Aaron and his descendants, who ate them in the holy place, because they were considered sacred (Lev 24:9). These were the loaves that David requested from Ahimelech for himself and his men (1 Sam 21:1-6; cf. also Matt 12:1-8; Mark 2:23-28).<br>

 <a name="fn826" href="luk.htm#fnB826"><sup>29</sup></a><b>sn</b> (6:7)  The background for this is the view that only if life was endangered should one attempt to heal on the Sabbath (see the Mishnah, <i>m. Shabbat </i>6.3; 12.1; 18.3; 19.2; <i>m. Yoma</i> 8.6).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (7:47)  <i>She loved much. </i>Jesus' point is that the person who realizes how great a gift forgiveness is (because they have a deep sense of sin) has a great love for the one who forgives, that is, God.

The equivalent Hebrew expression in the OT had two basic meanings: (1) When one person was unjustly bothering another, the injured party could say "What to me and to you?" meaning, "What have I done to you that you should do this to me?" (Judg 11:12; 2 Chr 35:21; 1 Kgs 17:18). (2) When someone was asked to get involved in a matter he felt was no business of his own, he could say to the one asking him, "What to me and to you?" meaning, "That is your business, how am I involved?" (2 Kgs 3:13; Hos 14:8). These nuances were apparently expanded in Greek, but the basic notions of defensive hostility (option 1) and indifference or disengagement (option 2) are still present. BAGD suggests the following as glosses for this expression: <i>What have I to do with you? What have we in common? Never mind!

 <a name="fn1487" href="luk.htm#fnB1487"><sup>186</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:60)  There are several options for the meaning of Jesus reply <i>Leave the dead to bury their own dead</i>: (1) Recent research suggests that burial customs in Palestine involved a reinterment of the bones a year after the initial burial, once the flesh had rotted away. At that point the son would have placed his father's bones in a special box to be set into the wall of the tomb. Thus Jesus could well be rebuking the man for wanting to wait around for as much as a year before making a commitment to follow him. In 1st century Jewish culture, to have followed Jesus rather than burying one's father would have seriously dishonored one's father (cf. Tobit 4:3-4). (2) The remark is an idiom (possibly a proverbial saying) that means, "The matter in question is not the real issue," in which case Jesus was making a word-play on the wording of the man's (literal) request (see L&amp;N 33.137). (3) This remark could be a figurative reference to various kinds of people, meaning, "Let the spiritually dead bury the dead." (4) It could also be literal and designed to shock the hearer by the surprise of the contrast. Whichever option is preferred, it is clear that the most important priority is to preach the gospel (<i>proclaim the kingdom of God</i>).<br>

But the original question was posed in terms of the first man who makes the request, not of the neighbor, so the teaching underscores the action of the one making the request.<br>

He first teaches (vv. 17-20) that if he casts out demons by the ruler of the demons, then in reality Satan is fighting against himself, with the result that his kingdom has come to an end. He then teaches (v. 21-22) about defeating the strong man to prove that he does not need to align himself with the devil because he is more powerful. Jesus defeated Satan at his temptation (4:1-13) and by his exorcisms he clearly demonstrated himself to be stronger than the devil. The passage reveals the desperate condition of the religious leaders, who in their hatred for Jesus end up attributing the work of the Holy Spirit to Satan.<br>

Does it mean merely "approach" or actually "come upon"? The issue here is like the one in 10:9 (see note there on the phrase "come on"). Is the arrival of the kingdom in process or merely anticipated? Two factors favor arrival. First, the prepositional phrase "on you" suggests arrival (Dan 4:24, 28 Theodotion). Second, the following illustration in vv. 21-23 looks at the healing as portraying Satan being overrun. So the presence of God's authority has come.<br>

The parallel passage in Luke 8:16 does not include "under a basket." If the phrase "under a basket" were added as a harmonization of Mark 4:21 and Matt 5:15, it is surprising that scribes did not add the phrase at Luke 8:16 as well. It is more likely that a scribe copying Luke would be inclined to harmonize 11:33 with 8:16 by omitting the phrase here. Thus, the words, "or under a basket" have the marks of originality.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (11:41)  In Jewish culture giving alms to the poor was a very important religious observance; it was meant to be an act of mercy, kindness, and love (D. Bock, <i>Luke</i> [BECNT], 2:1114). The implication from the text is that the Pharisees gave alms, but without any of the spiritual concern which should have motivated those generous actions. Here Jesus commands the Pharisees to give from within themselves to those in need instead of just giving of their possessions. In so doing they would show true inner purity acceptable to God. This is in keeping with the author's social concerns elsewhere in the Gospel (cf., e.g., 1:52-53, 4:18-19, 6:20-21, 14:13).<br>

Religious duties are not to be performed hypocritically, i.e., for the applause and esteem of people, but rather <i>they are to be done </i>out of a deep love for God and a sensitivity to and concern for the needs of others.

However, one must then determine what the beginning of the sentence connects to. Though it makes for slightly awkward English, the translation has opted to connect it to "he will answer" so that this functions, in effect, as an apodosis. One could end the sentence after "us" and begin a new sentence with "He will answer" to make simpler sentences, although the connection between the two sentences is thereby less clear. The point of the passage, however, is clear. Once the door is shut, because one failed to come in through the narrow way, it is closed permanently.

The first part of the illustration (<i>sit down first and determine</i>) deals with preparation. The second part of the illustration (<i>ask for terms of peace</i>) has to do with recognizing who is stronger. This could well suggest thinking about what refusing the "stronger one" (God) might mean, and thus constitutes a warning. Achieving peace with God, the more powerful king, is the point of the illustration.<br>
 <a name="fn2186" href="luk.htm#fnB2186"><sup>105</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:33)  <i>Grk</i> "Likewise therefore every one of you who does not renounce all his own possessions cannot be my disciple." The complex double negation is potentially confusing to the modern reader and has been simplified in the translation. See L&amp;N 57.70.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (14:33)  The application of the saying is this: discipleship requires that God be in first place. The reference to renunciation of <i>all his own possessions</i> refers to all earthly attachments that have first place.<br>
 <a name="fn2187" href="luk.htm#fnB2187"><sup>106</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:34)  <i>Grk</i> "Now salt..."; here <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ou\n</FONT> has not been translated.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (14:34)  <i>Salt</i> was used as seasoning, fertilizer, or as a preservative (BAGD 35 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">a{la"</FONT> 1). If salt ceased to be useful, it was thrown away. With this illustration Jesus warned about a disciple who ceased to follow him.<br>
 <a name="fn2188" href="luk.htm#fnB2188"><sup>107</sup></a><b>sn</b> (14:34)  The difficulty of this saying is understanding how <i>salt </i>could lose <i>its flavor</i> since its chemical properties cannot change. It is thus often assumed that Jesus was referring to chemically impure salt, perhaps a natural salt which, when exposed to the elements, had all the genuine salt leached out, leaving only the sediment or impurities behind. Others have suggested the background of the saying is the use of salt blocks by Arab bakers to line the floor of their ovens: under the intense heat these blocks would eventually crystallize and undergo a change in chemical composition, finally being thrown out as unserviceable. A saying in the Talmud (<i>b. Bekhorot </i>8b) attributed to R. Joshua ben Chananja (c. A.D. 90), when asked the question "When salt loses its flavor, how can it be made salty again?" is said to have replied, "By salting it with the afterbirth of a mule." He was then asked, "Then does the mule (being sterile) bear young?" to which he replied: "Can salt lose its flavor?" The point appears to be, both are impossible. The saying, while admittedly late, suggests that culturally the loss of flavor by salt was regarded as an impossibility. Genuine salt can never lose its flavor. In this case the saying by Jesus here may be similar to Matt 19:24, where it is likewise impossible for the camel to go through the eye of a sewing needle.<br>

 <a name="fn2191" href="luk.htm#fnB2191"><sup>110</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:35)  The translation "had better listen!" captures the force of the third person imperative more effectively than the traditional "let him hear," which sounds more like a permissive than an imperative to the modern English reader.

The Passover lamb was roasted and eaten after sunset in a family group of at least ten people (<i>m. Pesahim </i>7.13). People ate the meal while reclining (see the note on <i>table</i> in 22:14). It included, besides the lamb, unleavened bread and bitter herbs as a reminder of Israel's bitter affliction at the hands of the Egyptians.

However, a number of MSS mark the text with an asterisk or obelisk, indicating the scribe's assessment of the verses as inauthentic. At the same time, these verses generally fit Luke's style. Arguments can be given on both sides about whether scribes would tend to include or omit such comments about Jesus' humanity and an angel's help. But even if the verses are not <i>literarily </i>authentic, they are almost certainly <i>historically </i>authentic (that is, even if Luke did not pen these comments, this does not mean that Jesus did not have sweat like drops of blood). This is due to the fact that this text was well known in several different locales from a very early period. Since there are no synoptic parallels to this account and since there is no obvious reason for adding these words here, it is very likely that such verses recount a part of the actual suffering of our Lord.<br>

This alternative thus looks secondary because it is a more common word and less likely to be misunderstood as referring to a solar eclipse. That it appears in later witnesses rather than the earliest ones adds confirmatory testimony to its inauthentic character.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (23:45)  This imagery has parallels to the Day of the Lord: Joel 2:10; Amos 8:9; Zeph 1:15. Some students of the NT see in Luke's statement <i>the sun's light failed</i> (<i>eklipontos</i>) an obvious blunder in his otherwise meticulous historical accuracy. The reason for claiming such an error on the author's part is due to an understanding of the verb as indicating a solar <i>eclipse</i> when such would be an astronomical impossibility during a full moon. There are generally two ways to resolve this difficulty: (a) adopt a different reading ("the sun was darkened") that smoothes over the problem (discussed in the <b>tc</b> (23:45)  problem above), or (b) understand the verb <i>eklipontos</i> in a general way (such as "the sun's light <i>failed</i>") rather than as a technical term, "the sun was <i>eclipsed</i>." The problem with the first solution is that it is too convenient, for the Christian scribes who, over the centuries, copied Luke's Gospel would have thought the same thing. That is, they too would have sensed a problem in the wording and felt that some earlier scribe had incorrectly written down what Luke penned. The fact that the reading "was darkened" shows up in the later and generally inferior witnesses does not bolster one's confidence that this is the right solution. But second solution, if taken to its logical conclusion, proves too much for it would nullify the argument against the first solution: If the term did not refer to an eclipse, then why would scribes feel compelled to change it to a more general term? The solution to the problem is that <i>ekleipo</i> did in fact sometimes refer to an eclipse, but it did not always do so. (BAGD 242 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejkleivpw</FONT> notes that the verb is used in Hellenistic Greek "Of the sun <i>grow dark</i>, perh.<i> be eclipsed</i>." In MM it is argued that "it seems more than doubtful that in Lk 23<sup>45</sup> any reference is intended to an <i>eclipse</i>. To find such a reference is to involve the Evangelist in a needless blunder, as an <i>eclipse</i> is impossible at full moon, and to run counter to his general usage of the verb = `fail'..." [p. 195]. They enlist Luke 16:9; 22:32; and Heb 1:12 for the general meaning "fail," and further cite several contemporaneous examples from papyri of this meaning [195-96]) Thus, the very fact that the verb <i>can</i> refer to an eclipse would be a sufficient basis for later scribes altering the text out of pious motives; conversely, the very fact that the verb <i>does not always</i> refer to an eclipse and, in fact, does not normally do so, is enough of a basis to exonerate Luke of wholly uncharacteristic sloth.<br>

Many argue that the inner curtain is meant because another term, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kavlumma</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kalumma</FONT>), is also used for the outer curtain. Others see a reference to the outer curtain as more likely because of the public nature of this sign. Either way, the symbolism means that access to God has been opened up.

 <a name="fn3357" href="luk.htm#fnB3357"><sup>86</sup></a><b>tc</b> (24:32)  Most MSS add the phrase "within us" after "Didn't our hearts burn." The phrase "within us" is lacking in some early MSS (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>75 B D geo Origen).

 <a name="fn3374" href="luk.htm#fnB3374"><sup>103</sup></a><b>sn</b> (24:41)  <i>They still could not believe it. </i>Is this a continued statement of unbelief? Or is it a rhetorical expression of their amazement? They are being moved to faith, so a rhetorical force is more likely here.<br>

 <a name="fn3383" href="luk.htm#fnB3383"><sup>112</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:46)  Three Greek infinitives are the key to this summary: (1) to suffer, (2) to rise, and (3) to be preached. The Christ (Messiah) would be slain, would be raised, and a message about repentance would go out into all the world as a result. All of this was recorded in the scripture.

 <a name="fn3384" href="luk.htm#fnB3384"><sup>113</sup></a><b>sn</b> (24:47)  This <i>repentance</i> has its roots in declarations of the Old Testament. It is the Hebrew concept of a turning of direction.<br>

This is a reference to the Holy Spirit and looks back to how one could see Messiah had come with the promise of old (Luke 3:15-18). The promise is rooted in Jer 31:31 and Ezek 36:26.<br>
 <a name="fn3391" href="luk.htm#fnB3391"><sup>120</sup></a><b>sn</b> (24:49)  <i>The city </i>refers to Jerusalem.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (24:51)  There is great debate whether this event equals Acts 1:9-11 so that Luke has telescoped something here that he describes in more detail later. The text can be read in this way because the temporal marker in v. 50 is vague. <br>
