<p><A NAME="1"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> These are the things<a name="fnB0" href="deu_note.htm#fn0"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> that Moses said to the assembly of Israel<a name="fnB1" href="deu_note.htm#fn1"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> in the Transjordanian<a name="fnB2" href="deu_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> wastelands, the dry country opposite<a name="fnB3" href="deu_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> Suph,<a name="fnB4" href="deu_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> between<a name="fnB5" href="deu_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> Paran,<a name="fnB6" href="deu_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> Tophel,<a name="fnB7" href="deu_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> Laban,<a name="fnB8" href="deu_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> Hazeroth,<a name="fnB9" href="deu_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and Di Zahab<a name="fnB10" href="deu_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  (Now it is ordinarily an eleven-day journey<a name="fnB11" href="deu_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> from Horeb<a name="fnB12" href="deu_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> to Kadesh Barnea<a name="fnB13" href="deu_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> by way of Mount Seir.<a name="fnB14" href="deu_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  However, it was not until<a name="fnB15" href="deu_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> the first day of the eleventh month<a name="fnB16" href="deu_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> of the fortieth year<a name="fnB17" href="deu_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> that Moses addressed the Israelites as the LORD had instructed him to do. 
<bqverse 4>4  This took place after the defeat<a name="fnB18" href="deu_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> of King Sihon<a name="fnB19" href="deu_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> of the Amorites, whose capital was<a name="fnB20" href="deu_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> in Heshbon;<a name="fnB21" href="deu_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> and King Og of Bashan, whose capital was<a name="fnB22" href="deu_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> in Ashtaroth,<a name="fnB23" href="deu_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> specifically in Edrei.<a name="fnB24" href="deu_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  So, it was in the Transjordan, in Moab, that Moses began to deliver this instruction<a name="fnB25" href="deu_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> as follows):<a name="_Toc494011649"></a></p>
<p><i>Events at Horeb</i>
<p>
<bqverse 6>6  The LORD our God spoke to us at Horeb and said,<a name="fnB26" href="deu_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> "You have been<a name="fnB27" href="deu_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> in the area of this mountain long enough. 
<bqverse 7>7  Get up now,<a name="fnB28" href="deu_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> resume your journey, heading for<a name="fnB29" href="deu_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> the Amorite hill country, to all its areas<a name="fnB30" href="deu_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> including the dry country,<a name="fnB31" href="deu_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> the highlands, the Shephelah,<a name="fnB32" href="deu_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> the Negev,<a name="fnB33" href="deu_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> and the coastal plain--all of Canaan and Lebanon as far as the Great River, that is, the Euphrates. 
<bqverse 8>8  Look! I have already given over the land to you. Go, occupy the territory<a name="fnB34" href="deu_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> that I<a name="fnB35" href="deu_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> swore to give to your ancestors<a name="fnB36" href="deu_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to their descendants."<a name="fnB37" href="deu_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  Then I also said to you at that time, "I am no longer able to sustain<a name="fnB38" href="deu_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> you by myself. 
<bqverse 10>10  The LORD your God has increased your population<a name="fnB39" href="deu_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> to the point that you are now as numerous as the very stars of the sky.<a name="fnB40" href="deu_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  Indeed, may the LORD, the God of your ancestors, make you a thousand times as many as you are now, blessing you<a name="fnB41" href="deu_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> just as he said he would. 
<bqverse 12>12  But how can I alone bear up under the burden of<a name="fnB42" href="deu_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> your hardship and strife? 
<bqverse 13>13  Select wise and practical<a name="fnB43" href="deu_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> men, those known among your tribes, whom I may appoint as your leaders." 
<bqverse 14>14  You replied to me that what I had said to you was good. 
<bqverse 15>15  So I chose<a name="fnB44" href="deu_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> as your tribal leaders wise and well known men, placing them over you as administrators of groups of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens, and also as other tribal officials. 
<bqverse 16>16  I furthermore admonished your judges at that time that they<a name="fnB45" href="deu_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> should pay attention to issues among your fellow citizens<a name="fnB46" href="deu_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> and judge fairly,<a name="fnB47" href="deu_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> whether between one citizen<a name="fnB48" href="deu_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> and another<a name="fnB49" href="deu_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> or a citizen and an immigrant.<a name="fnB50" href="deu_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  They<a name="fnB51" href="deu_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> must not discriminate in judgment, but hear the little and great alike. Nor should they be intimidated by human beings, for judgment belongs to God. If the matter being adjudicated is too difficult for them, they should bring it before me for a hearing.<a name="fnB52" href="deu_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494011650"></a></p>
<p><i>Instructions at Kadesh Barnea</i>
<p>
<bqverse 18>18  Thus I instructed you at that time regarding everything you should do. 
<bqverse 19>19  Then we struck out from Horeb and passed through all that immense, forbidding wilderness that you saw on the way to the Amorite hill country as the LORD our God had commanded us to do, finally arriving<a name="fnB53" href="deu_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> at Kadesh Barnea. 
<bqverse 20>20  Then I said to you, "You have come to the Amorite hill country which the LORD our God is about to give us. 
<bqverse 21>21  Look, he<a name="fnB54" href="deu_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> has set the land before<a name="fnB55" href="deu_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> you. Go up, take possession of it just as the LORD, the God of your ancestors, said to do. Don't be afraid or discouraged." 
<bqverse 22>22  So all of you approached me and said, "Let's send some people ahead of us to scout out the land and bring us back word as to how we should go up and what the cities are like there." 
<bqverse 23>23  I thought this was a good idea<a name="fnB56" href="deu_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> so I sent twelve men from among you, one from each tribe. 
<bqverse 24>24  They left and ascended to the hill country, coming to the Eshcol Valley,<a name="fnB57" href="deu_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> which they spied out. 
<bqverse 25>25  Then they took some of the produce of the land and, carrying it back down to us, they also brought news that the land that the LORD our God was about to give us was good.<a name="_Toc494011651"></a></p>
<p><i>Disobedience at Kadesh Barnea</i>
<p>
<bqverse 26>26  You were not willing to go up, however, but instead rebelled against the LORD your God. 
<bqverse 27>27  You complained among yourselves<a name="fnB58" href="deu_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> and said, "Because the LORD hated us he brought us from Egypt to deliver us over to the Amorites so they could destroy us. 
<bqverse 28>28  What is going to happen to us?<a name="fnB59" href="deu_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> Our brothers have drained away our courage<a name="fnB60" href="deu_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> by describing people who are more numerous<a name="fnB61" href="deu_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> and taller than we are, and great cities whose battlements appear to be as high as heaven<a name="fnB62" href="deu_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> itself. Moreover, they said they saw<a name="fnB63" href="deu_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> Anakites<a name="fnB64" href="deu_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> there." 
<bqverse 29>29  So I responded to you, "Do not be so terrified<a name="fnB65" href="deu_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a> of them. 
<bqverse 30>30  The LORD your God is about to go up ahead of you; he will fight for you, just as you saw him do in Egypt<a name="fnB66" href="deu_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 31>31  and in the desert, where you experienced him<a name="fnB67" href="deu_note.htm#fn67"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a> carrying you along like a man carries his son. This he did everywhere you went until you came to this very place." 
<bqverse 32>32  However, through all this you did not have confidence in the LORD your God, 
<bqverse 33>33  the one who was constantly with you to find campsites for you and, by fire at night and cloud by day, to show you the way you ought to go.<a name="_Toc494011652"></a></p>
<p><i>Judgment at Kadesh Barnea</i>
<p>
<bqverse 34>34  When the LORD heard you,<a name="fnB68" href="deu_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>69</SUP></FONT></a> he became angry and swore that 
<bqverse 35>35 not a single person<a name="fnB69" href="deu_note.htm#fn69"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>70</SUP></FONT></a> of that evil generation would see the good land that he had pledged to give to their<a name="fnB70" href="deu_note.htm#fn70"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>71</SUP></FONT></a> ancestors.<a name="fnB71" href="deu_note.htm#fn71"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>72</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 36>36  The exception would be Caleb son of Jephunneh;<a name="fnB72" href="deu_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>73</SUP></FONT></a> he would see it and would also be given<a name="fnB73" href="deu_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>74</SUP></FONT></a> the territory on which he had walked, as would his descendants, because he had wholeheartedly followed the LORD. 
<bqverse 37>37  As for me, the LORD was also angry with me on your account. He said, "You also will not be able to go there. 
<bqverse 38>38  However, Joshua son of Nun, your attendant,<a name="fnB74" href="deu_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>75</SUP></FONT></a> will go. Encourage him, because he will enable Israel to inherit the land.<a name="fnB75" href="deu_note.htm#fn75"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>76</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 39>39  Also, your infants, who you thought would never make it,<a name="fnB76" href="deu_note.htm#fn76"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>77</SUP></FONT></a> and your children, who as yet do not know good from bad,<a name="fnB77" href="deu_note.htm#fn77"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>78</SUP></FONT></a> will go there and I will give them the land and they will possess it. 
<bqverse 40>40  But as for you, turn back and head for the desert by the way to the Red Sea."<a name="fnB78" href="deu_note.htm#fn78"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>79</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494011653"></a></p>
<p><i>Unsuccessful Conquest of Canaan</i>
<p>
<bqverse 41>41  Then you responded to me and admitted, "We have sinned against the LORD. We will now go up and fight as he<a name="fnB79" href="deu_note.htm#fn79"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>80</SUP></FONT></a> has told us to do." So you each put on your war apparel and made as though you were going up to the hill country. 
<bqverse 42>42  But the LORD told me to tell you not to go up and fight because he would not be<a name="fnB80" href="deu_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>81</SUP></FONT></a> with you and the result would be defeat at the hands of<a name="fnB81" href="deu_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>82</SUP></FONT></a> your enemies. 
<bqverse 43>43  I therefore spoke to you, but you did not listen. Instead you rebelled against the LORD<a name="fnB82" href="deu_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>83</SUP></FONT></a> and recklessly ascended to the hill country. 
<bqverse 44>44  The Amorite inhabitants of that area<a name="fnB83" href="deu_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>84</SUP></FONT></a> came out to meet you and chased you like a swarm of bees, striking you down from<a name="fnB84" href="deu_note.htm#fn84"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>85</SUP></FONT></a> Seir to Hormah.<a name="fnB85" href="deu_note.htm#fn85"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>86</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 45>45  Then you came back and wept before the LORD, but he<a name="fnB86" href="deu_note.htm#fn86"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>87</SUP></FONT></a> paid no attention to you<a name="fnB87" href="deu_note.htm#fn87"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>88</SUP></FONT></a> whatsoever.<a name="fnB88" href="deu_note.htm#fn88"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>89</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 46>46  Therefore, you remained at Kadesh for a long time;<a name="fnB89" href="deu_note.htm#fn89"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>90</SUP></FONT></a> indeed, for the full time.<a name="fnB90" href="deu_note.htm#fn90"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>91</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqchapter 2>
<a name="_Toc494011654"></a></p>
<p><i>The Journey from Kadesh Barnea to Moab</i>
<p><A NAME="2"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Then we turned and set out toward the desert land on the way to the Red Sea<a name="fnB91" href="deu_note.htm#fn91"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> just as the LORD told me to do, detouring around Mount Seir for a long time.<a name="fnB92" href="deu_note.htm#fn92"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  At this point<a name="fnB93" href="deu_note.htm#fn93"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD 
<bqverse 3>3  said to me, "You have circled around this mountain long enough--now turn north. 
<bqverse 4>4  Instruct<a name="fnB94" href="deu_note.htm#fn94"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> these people as follows: `You are about to cross the border of your relatives<a name="fnB95" href="deu_note.htm#fn95"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> the descendants of Esau,<a name="fnB96" href="deu_note.htm#fn96"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> who inhabit Seir. They will be afraid of you, so watch yourselves carefully. 
<bqverse 5>5  Do not be hostile against them, because I am not giving you any of their land, not even a footprint,<a name="fnB97" href="deu_note.htm#fn97"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> for I have given Mount Seir<a name="fnB98" href="deu_note.htm#fn98"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> as an inheritance for Esau. 
<bqverse 6>6  You may purchase<a name="fnB99" href="deu_note.htm#fn99"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> food from them to eat and water to drink. 
<bqverse 7>7  All along the way I<a name="fnB100" href="deu_note.htm#fn100"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> have blessed your every effort.<a name="fnB101" href="deu_note.htm#fn101"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> I have<a name="fnB102" href="deu_note.htm#fn102"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> been attentive to<a name="fnB103" href="deu_note.htm#fn103"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> your travels through this great wasteland. All these forty years I have<a name="fnB104" href="deu_note.htm#fn104"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> been with you; you have lacked for nothing.'" <p>

<bqverse 8>8  So we turned away from our brothers<a name="fnB105" href="deu_note.htm#fn105"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> the descendants of Esau, the inhabitants of Seir, from the desert<a name="fnB106" href="deu_note.htm#fn106"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> route, from Elath<a name="fnB107" href="deu_note.htm#fn107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> and Ezion Geber,<a name="fnB108" href="deu_note.htm#fn108"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and turned instead and traveled the way of the Moab wastelands. 
<bqverse 9>9  Then the LORD said to me, "Do not harass Moab and provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land as your territory. This is because I have given Ar<a name="fnB109" href="deu_note.htm#fn109"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> to the descendants of Lot<a name="fnB110" href="deu_note.htm#fn110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> as their possession. 
<bqverse 10>10  The Emites<a name="fnB111" href="deu_note.htm#fn111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> used to live there, a people as powerful, numerous, and tall as the Anakites. 
<bqverse 11>11  These people, as well as the Anakites, are also considered Rephaites<a name="fnB112" href="deu_note.htm#fn112"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a>--the Moabites call them Emites. 
<bqverse 12>12  Previously the Horites<a name="fnB113" href="deu_note.htm#fn113"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> lived in Seir but the descendants of Esau dispossessed and utterly annihilated them and settled in their place, just as Israel did to the land it came to possess, the land I<a name="fnB114" href="deu_note.htm#fn114"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> gave them. 
<bqverse 13>13  Now, get up and cross the Wadi Zered."<a name="fnB115" href="deu_note.htm#fn115"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> So we did so.<a name="fnB116" href="deu_note.htm#fn116"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  Now the length of time<a name="fnB117" href="deu_note.htm#fn117"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> it took for us to go from Kadesh Barnea to the crossing of Wadi Zered was thirty-eight years, time for all the military men of that generation to be finished off, just as the LORD had sworn to them. 
<bqverse 15>15  Indeed, it was the very hand of the LORD that devoured them from the middle of the camp until they were totally decimated.<a name="_Toc494011655"></a></p>
<p><i>Instructions Concerning Ammon</i>
<p>
<bqverse 16>16  So it was that after all the military men had been put to death from among the rest of the people, 
<bqverse 17>17  the LORD said to me, 
<bqverse 18>18  "Today you are going to cross the border of Moab, that is, of Ar.<a name="fnB118" href="deu_note.htm#fn118"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  But when you come close to the Ammonites do not bother or provoke them, because I am not giving you any of the Ammonites' land as your possession; I have already given it to Lot's descendants<a name="fnB119" href="deu_note.htm#fn119"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> as their possession.<p>

<bqverse 20>20  (That also is considered to be a land of the Rephaites.<a name="fnB120" href="deu_note.htm#fn120"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> The Rephaites lived there originally;<a name="fnB121" href="deu_note.htm#fn121"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> the Ammonites call them Zamzummites.<a name="fnB122" href="deu_note.htm#fn122"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  They are a people as powerful, numerous, and tall as Anakites. But the LORD destroyed the Rephaites<a name="fnB123" href="deu_note.htm#fn123"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> in advance of the Ammonites,<a name="fnB124" href="deu_note.htm#fn124"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> so they dispossessed them and settled down in their place. 
<bqverse 22>22  This is just what he did for the descendants of Esau who lived in Seir when he destroyed the Horites before them so that they could dispossess<a name="fnB125" href="deu_note.htm#fn125"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> them and settle in their area to this very day. 
<bqverse 23>23  Also, as for the Avvites<a name="fnB126" href="deu_note.htm#fn126"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> who lived in settlements as far west as Gaza, Caphtorites<a name="fnB127" href="deu_note.htm#fn127"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> who came from Caphtor demolished them and lived there instead.<a name="fnB128" href="deu_note.htm#fn128"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a>)<p>

<bqverse 24>24  Get up, make your way across Wadi Arnon. Look! I have already delivered over to you Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon,<a name="fnB129" href="deu_note.htm#fn129"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> and his land. Go ahead! Take it! Engage him in war! 
<bqverse 25>25  This very day I will begin to fill all the people of the earth<a name="fnB130" href="deu_note.htm#fn130"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> with dread and to terrify them when they hear about you.

<p><i>Defeat of Sihon, King of Heshbon</i>
<p>
<bqverse 26>26  Then I sent messengers from the Kedemoth<a name="fnB132" href="deu_note.htm#fn132"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> Desert to King Sihon of Heshbon with words of peace, 
<bqverse 27>27  "Let me pass through your land; I will keep strictly to the roadway.<a name="fnB133" href="deu_note.htm#fn133"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> I will not turn aside to the right or the left. 
<bqverse 28>28  Sell me food for cash<a name="fnB134" href="deu_note.htm#fn134"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> so that I can eat and give me water to drink. Just allow me to go through on foot, 
<bqverse 29>29  just as the descendants of Esau at Seir and the Moabites of Ar did for me until I cross the Jordan to the land the LORD our God is giving us." 
<bqverse 30>30  But King Sihon of Heshbon was unwilling to allow us to pass over near him because the LORD our God had given him a resistant spirit<a name="fnB135" href="deu_note.htm#fn135"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> and stubborn determination<a name="fnB136" href="deu_note.htm#fn136"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> so that he might deliver him over to you this very day. 
<bqverse 31>31  Surely enough, the LORD said to me, "Look! I have already begun to give over Sihon and his land to you. Start right now to take his land as your possession." 
<bqverse 32>32  When Sihon and all his troops<a name="fnB137" href="deu_note.htm#fn137"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> emerged to encounter us in battle at Jahaz,<a name="fnB138" href="deu_note.htm#fn138"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 33>33  the LORD our God delivered him over to us and we struck him down, along with his son and everyone else.<a name="fnB139" href="deu_note.htm#fn139"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 34>34  At that time we seized all his cities and put every one of them that was inhabited<a name="fnB140" href="deu_note.htm#fn140"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> under the divine curse,<a name="fnB141" href="deu_note.htm#fn141"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> even the women and children; there was not a single survivor. 
<bqverse 35>35  Only the livestock and plunder from the cities did we keep<a name="fnB142" href="deu_note.htm#fn142"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> for ourselves. 
<bqverse 36>36  From Aroer,<a name="fnB143" href="deu_note.htm#fn143"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> which is at the edge of Wadi Arnon, and the city in the wadi,<a name="fnB144" href="deu_note.htm#fn144"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> all the way to Gilead there was not a city too inaccessible to us--the LORD our God gave them all to us. 
<bqverse 37>37  However, you did not approach the land of the Ammonites, the Wadi Jabbok<a name="fnB145" href="deu_note.htm#fn145"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> valley, the cities of the hill country, or any place else forbidden by the LORD our God.

<a name="_Toc494011657"></a></p>
<p><i>Defeat of King Og of Bashan</i>
<p><A NAME="3"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>Next we set out on<a name="fnB146" href="deu_note.htm#fn146"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> the route to Bashan,<a name="fnB147" href="deu_note.htm#fn147"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> but King Og of Bashan and his whole army<a name="fnB148" href="deu_note.htm#fn148"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> came out to meet us in battle at Edrei.<a name="fnB149" href="deu_note.htm#fn149"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  The LORD, however, said to me, "Don't be afraid of him because I have already given him, his army,<a name="fnB150" href="deu_note.htm#fn150"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and his land to you. You will do to him exactly what you did to King Sihon of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon." 
<bqverse 3>3  So the LORD our God did indeed give over King Og of Bashan and all his people to us and we rained blows on<a name="fnB151" href="deu_note.htm#fn151"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> him until not a single survivor was left.<a name="fnB152" href="deu_note.htm#fn152"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  We took all his cities at that time--there was not a one we did not capture from them--sixty cities, all the region of Argob,<a name="fnB153" href="deu_note.htm#fn153"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> the dominion of Og in Bashan. 
<bqverse 5>5  All of these cities were fortified by high walls, gates, and bars; in addition there were a great many open villages.<a name="fnB154" href="deu_note.htm#fn154"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  We put all of these under the divine curse<a name="fnB155" href="deu_note.htm#fn155"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> just as we had done to King Sihon of Heshbon--every occupied city, including women and children. 
<bqverse 7>7  But all the livestock and urban plunder we appropriated to ourselves. 
<bqverse 8>8  Thus at that time we took the land of the two Amorite kings in the Transjordan from Wadi Arnon to Mount Hermon<a name="fnB156" href="deu_note.htm#fn156"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  (the Sidonians<a name="fnB157" href="deu_note.htm#fn157"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> call Hermon Sirion<a name="fnB158" href="deu_note.htm#fn158"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> and the Amorites call it Senir),<a name="fnB159" href="deu_note.htm#fn159"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  all the cities of the plateau, all of Gilead and Bashan as far as Salecah<a name="fnB160" href="deu_note.htm#fn160"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> and Edrei,<a name="fnB161" href="deu_note.htm#fn161"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
<bqverse 11>11  Only King Og of Bashan was left of the remaining Rephaites. (It is noteworthy<a name="fnB162" href="deu_note.htm#fn162"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> that his sarcophagus<a name="fnB163" href="deu_note.htm#fn163"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> was made of iron.<a name="fnB164" href="deu_note.htm#fn164"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> Does it not, indeed, still remain in Rabbath<a name="fnB165" href="deu_note.htm#fn165"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> of the Ammonites? It is thirteen and a half feet<a name="fnB166" href="deu_note.htm#fn166"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> long and six feet<a name="fnB167" href="deu_note.htm#fn167"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> wide according to standard measure.)<a name="fnB168" href="deu_note.htm#fn168"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494011658"></a></p>
<p><i>Distribution of the Transjordanian Allotments</i>
<p>
<bqverse 12>12  This is the land we brought under our control at that time: from Aroer<a name="fnB169" href="deu_note.htm#fn169"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> by the Wadi Arnon and half the Gilead hill country with its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and Gadites.<a name="fnB170" href="deu_note.htm#fn170"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  The rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to half the tribe of Manasseh.<a name="fnB171" href="deu_note.htm#fn171"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> (All the region of Argob,<a name="fnB172" href="deu_note.htm#fn172"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> that is, all Bashan, is called the land of Rephaim. 
<bqverse 14>14  Jair, son of Manasseh, took all the Argob region as far as the border with the Geshurites<a name="fnB173" href="deu_note.htm#fn173"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> and Maacathites<a name="fnB174" href="deu_note.htm#fn174"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> and called it,<a name="fnB175" href="deu_note.htm#fn175"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> namely, Bashan, by his name, Havvoth-Jair,<a name="fnB176" href="deu_note.htm#fn176"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> to this very day.) 
<bqverse 15>15  I gave Gilead to Machir.<a name="fnB177" href="deu_note.htm#fn177"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  To the Reubenites and Gadites I allocated from Gilead beginning with<a name="fnB178" href="deu_note.htm#fn178"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> Wadi Arnon (the exact middle of the wadi as a boundary) all the way to the Wadi Jabbok, the Ammonite border. 
<bqverse 17>17  The Arabah and Jordan River<a name="fnB179" href="deu_note.htm#fn179"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> also were a border, from Chinnereth<a name="fnB180" href="deu_note.htm#fn180"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> to the Arabah sea, that is, the Salt Sea,<a name="fnB181" href="deu_note.htm#fn181"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> beneath the watershed<a name="fnB182" href="deu_note.htm#fn182"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> of Pisgah<a name="fnB183" href="deu_note.htm#fn183"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> to the east.<a name="_Toc494011659"></a></p>
<p><i>Instructions to the Transjordanian Tribes</i>
<p>
<bqverse 18>18  I instructed<a name="fnB184" href="deu_note.htm#fn184"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> you at that time as follows, "The LORD your God has given you this land for your possession.<a name="fnB185" href="deu_note.htm#fn185"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> You are to cross over before your fellow Israelites,<a name="fnB186" href="deu_note.htm#fn186"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> all the warriors, equipped for battle. 
<bqverse 19>19  But your wives, children, and livestock (of which I know you have many) must remain in the cities I have given you 
<bqverse 20>20  until the LORD helps your fellow countrymen prevail<a name="fnB187" href="deu_note.htm#fn187"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> as you have, and allows them to possess the land that he<a name="fnB188" href="deu_note.htm#fn188"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> is giving them on the other side of the Jordan River. Then each of you may return to his own territory which I have given you." 
<bqverse 21>21  I also commanded Joshua at the same time, "You have seen<a name="fnB189" href="deu_note.htm#fn189"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> everything the LORD your God did to these two kings; he will do the same to the kingdoms where you are going.<a name="fnB190" href="deu_note.htm#fn190"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  Do not be afraid of them, for the LORD your God will personally fight for you."<a name="_Toc494011660"></a></p>
<p><i>Denial to Moses of the Promised Land</i>
<p>
<bqverse 23>23  Moreover, at that time I pleaded with the LORD, 
<bqverse 24>24  "O, Lord GOD,<a name="fnB191" href="deu_note.htm#fn191"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> you have begun to show me<a name="fnB192" href="deu_note.htm#fn192"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> your greatness and strength (what god in fact in heaven or earth can rival your works and mighty deeds?); 
<bqverse 25>25  let me please cross over to see the good land on the other side of the Jordan River--this good hill country and the Lebanon." 
<bqverse 26>26  But the LORD was angry at me because of you and would not listen to me. Instead, he said to me, "Enough of that!<a name="fnB193" href="deu_note.htm#fn193"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> Do not speak to me anymore about the matter. 
<bqverse 27>27  Go up to the top of Pisgah and look west, north, south, and east with your own eyes, for you will not be allowed to cross the Jordan. 
<bqverse 28>28  Commission, encourage, and strengthen Joshua, because he will lead these people over<a name="fnB194" href="deu_note.htm#fn194"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> and will enable them to inherit the land you will see." 
<bqverse 29>29  So we settled down in the valley opposite Beth Peor.<a name="fnB195" href="deu_note.htm#fn195"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 9>9  Again, however, pay very careful attention,<a name="fnB211" href="deu_note.htm#fn211"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> lest you forget the things you have seen and disregard them<a name="fnB212" href="deu_note.htm#fn212"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> for the rest of your life; instead teach them<a name="fnB213" href="deu_note.htm#fn213"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> to your children and grandchildren. 
<bqverse 10>10  At the time<a name="fnB214" href="deu_note.htm#fn214"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb and he<a name="fnB215" href="deu_note.htm#fn215"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> said to me, "Assemble the people before me so that I can tell them my words and teach them to revere<a name="fnB216" href="deu_note.htm#fn216"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> me all the days they live in the land, and also to instruct their children." 
<bqverse 11>11  You approached and stood at the foot of the mountain, a mountain ablaze to the sky above it,<a name="fnB217" href="deu_note.htm#fn217"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> and yet dark with a thick cloud.<a name="fnB218" href="deu_note.htm#fn218"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 19>19  It is also to guard you against looking up to the sky<a name="fnB225" href="deu_note.htm#fn225"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> and seeing the sun, moon, and stars--the whole heavenly creation<a name="fnB226" href="deu_note.htm#fn226"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a>--and then being seduced by them to worship and serve them, things that the LORD your God has distributed among all the people of the world.<a name="fnB227" href="deu_note.htm#fn227"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  You, however, the LORD has selected<a name="fnB228" href="deu_note.htm#fn228"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> and brought from Egypt, the "iron-smelting furnace,"<a name="fnB229" href="deu_note.htm#fn229"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> to be the people that he inherits, as you are today. 
<bqverse 21>21  But the LORD became angry with me because of you and swore that I would never cross the Jordan nor enter the good land that he<a name="fnB230" href="deu_note.htm#fn230"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> is about to give you as an inheritance. 
<bqverse 22>22  So I must die here in this land--there is no crossing of the Jordan for me; but you are going over and will possess that good land. 
<bqverse 23>23  Be on guard so that you do not forget the covenant of the LORD your God that he has made with you, and that you do not make an image of any shape, just as he<a name="fnB231" href="deu_note.htm#fn231"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> has forbidden you. 
<bqverse 24>24  For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.<a name="fnB232" href="deu_note.htm#fn232"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494011664"></a></p>
<p><i>Threat and Blessing following Covenant Disobedience</i>
<p>
<bqverse 25>25  After you have produced children and grandchildren and have been in the land a long time, if you become corrupted and make an image of any kind<a name="fnB233" href="deu_note.htm#fn233"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> and do other evil things before the LORD your God that enrage him, 
<bqverse 26>26  I invoke heaven and earth as witnesses against you<a name="fnB234" href="deu_note.htm#fn234"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> today that you will surely and swiftly be destroyed from the very land you are about to cross the Jordan to possess. You will not last long there<a name="fnB235" href="deu_note.htm#fn235"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> because you will be totally devastated. 
<bqverse 27>27  Then the LORD will scatter you among the peoples and there will be very few of you<a name="fnB236" href="deu_note.htm#fn236"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> in the nations where the LORD will drive you. 
<bqverse 28>28  There you will worship gods made by human hands--wood and stone that can neither see, hear, eat, nor smell. 
<bqverse 29>29  But if<a name="fnB237" href="deu_note.htm#fn237"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> you seek the LORD your God from there, you will find him, if, indeed, you seek him with all your heart and soul. 
<bqverse 30>30  In your distress when all these things happen to you<a name="fnB238" href="deu_note.htm#fn238"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> in the latter days, if you return to the LORD your God and listen to him<a name="fnB239" href="deu_note.htm#fn239"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 31>31  (for he<a name="fnB240" href="deu_note.htm#fn240"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> is a merciful God), he will not let you down or destroy you, for he cannot forget the covenant with your ancestors that he swore to them.<a name="_Toc494011665"></a></p>
<p><i>The Uniqueness of Israel's God</i>
<p>
<bqverse 32>32  Indeed, ask about earlier days that have preceded you, from the day God created mankind<a name="fnB241" href="deu_note.htm#fn241"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> on the earth and from one end of heaven to the other, whether there has ever been such a great thing as this, or even a rumor of it.<a name="fnB242" href="deu_note.htm#fn242"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 33>33  Have a people ever heard the voice of God speaking from fire, as you yourselves have, and lived to tell about it? 
<bqverse 34>34  Or has God ever before tried to deliver<a name="fnB243" href="deu_note.htm#fn243"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> a nation to himself from the middle of another nation, accompanied by testings, signs, wonders, war, strength, power,<a name="fnB244" href="deu_note.htm#fn244"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> and other very terrifying things like the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes? 
<bqverse 35>35  You have been made to understand<a name="fnB245" href="deu_note.htm#fn245"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> that the LORD alone is God--there is no other besides him. 
<bqverse 36>36  From heaven he spoke to you<a name="fnB246" href="deu_note.htm#fn246"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> in order to teach you, and on earth showed you his great fire from which you also heard him.<a name="fnB247" href="deu_note.htm#fn247"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 37>37  Moreover, because he loved<a name="fnB248" href="deu_note.htm#fn248"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> your ancestors he chose their<a name="fnB249" href="deu_note.htm#fn249"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> descendants who followed<a name="fnB250" href="deu_note.htm#fn250"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> them,<a name="fnB251" href="deu_note.htm#fn251"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> and personally<a name="fnB252" href="deu_note.htm#fn252"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> brought you out of Egypt with great power 
<bqverse 38>38  to dispossess nations greater and more powerful than you and brought you in to give you their land as an inheritance--just as it has taken place today. 
<bqverse 39>39  May you understand today and take it to heart that the LORD is God in heaven above and on earth below--there is no other! 
<bqverse 40>40  And may you keep his statutes and commandments that I am setting forth<a name="fnB253" href="deu_note.htm#fn253"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> today so that it may go well with you and your descendants and that you might enjoy longevity<a name="fnB254" href="deu_note.htm#fn254"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> in the land that the LORD your God is about to give you forever.<a name="_Toc494011666"></a></p>
<p><i>The Narrative Concerning Cities of Refuge</i>
<p>
<bqverse 41>41  After all this Moses separated off three cities in the Transjordan, toward the east, 
<bqverse 42>42  so that anyone who accidentally killed another<a name="fnB255" href="deu_note.htm#fn255"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> without having hated him in the past could flee to one of those cities and be safe.<a name="fnB256" href="deu_note.htm#fn256"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 43>43  These cities are Bezer, in the desert plateau, for the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan for the Manassehites.<a name="_Toc494011667"></a></p>
<p><i>The Setting and Introduction of the Covenant</i>
<p>
<bqverse 44>44  Finally, this is the instruction that Moses set before the Israelites--
<bqverse 45>45  the stipulations, statutes, and requirements that he<a name="fnB257" href="deu_note.htm#fn257"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> spoke to them<a name="fnB258" href="deu_note.htm#fn258"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> after he had brought them out of Egypt, 
<bqverse 46>46  in the Transjordan, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, in the land of King Sihon of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon. (It is he whom Moses and the Israelites attacked after they came out of Egypt. 
<bqverse 47>47  They possessed his land and that of King Og of Bashan--both of these being Amorite kings in the Transjordan, to the east-- 
<bqverse 48>48  from Aroer at the edge of the Arnon valley as far as Mount Siyon<a name="fnB259" href="deu_note.htm#fn259"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a>--that is, Hermon--

<p><i>The Narrative of the Sinai Revelation and Israel's Response</i>
<p>
<bqverse 22>22  All these things the LORD said to your entire assembly at the mountain from the fire, the cloud, and the darkness with a loud voice, and that was all.<a name="fnB291" href="deu_note.htm#fn291"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> And he inscribed the words<a name="fnB292" href="deu_note.htm#fn292"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> on two stone tablets and gave them to me. 
<bqverse 23>23  Then, when you heard the voice from the darkness while the mountain was ablaze, you approached me--all of your tribal leaders and elders-- 
<bqverse 24>24  and you said, "The LORD our God has shown us his great glory<a name="fnB293" href="deu_note.htm#fn293"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> and we have heard him from the fire. It is now clear to us<a name="fnB294" href="deu_note.htm#fn294"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> that God can speak to human beings and they can keep on living. 
<bqverse 25>25  Now, therefore, why should we die, because this intense fire will consume us! If we keep hearing the voice of the LORD our God we will certainly die! 
<bqverse 26>26  Who is there from all the human race<a name="fnB295" href="deu_note.htm#fn295"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> who has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the fire as we have and has lived? 
<bqverse 27>27  Please get near so that you can hear everything the LORD our God is saying and then tell us whatever he<a name="fnB296" href="deu_note.htm#fn296"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> says to you; then we will pay attention and do it." 
<bqverse 28>28  When the LORD heard you<a name="fnB297" href="deu_note.htm#fn297"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> speaking to me he said to me, "I have heard all that these people have said to you--they have spoken well. 
<bqverse 29>29  If only it would really be their desire<a name="fnB298" href="deu_note.htm#fn298"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> to fear me and keep all my commandments forever, so that it may go well with them and their descendants eternally. 
<bqverse 30>30  Go and tell them, `Return to your tents!' 
<bqverse 31>31  But as for you, remain here with me so I can declare to you all the commandments,<a name="fnB299" href="deu_note.htm#fn299"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> statutes, and ordinances that you are to teach them so that they can carry them out in the land I am about to give them as an inheritance."<a name="fnB300" href="deu_note.htm#fn300"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 32>32  Be careful, therefore, to do exactly what the LORD your God has commanded you; do not turn right or left! 
<bqverse 33>33  Walk just as<a name="fnB301" href="deu_note.htm#fn301"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> he<a name="fnB302" href="deu_note.htm#fn302"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> has said<a name="fnB303" href="deu_note.htm#fn303"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> so that you may live, that it may go well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land you are going to possess.

<bqverse 7>7  It is not because you were more numerous than all the other peoples that the LORD considered and chose you--for in fact you were the smallest of all peoples-- 
<bqverse 8>8  but because of his<a name="fnB353" href="deu_note.htm#fn353"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> love<a name="fnB354" href="deu_note.htm#fn354"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> for you and his faithfulness to the oath<a name="fnB355" href="deu_note.htm#fn355"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> he swore to your ancestors<a name="fnB356" href="deu_note.htm#fn356"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD brought you out with great power, redeeming<a name="fnB357" href="deu_note.htm#fn357"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> you from the place of slavery,<a name="fnB358" href="deu_note.htm#fn358"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 
<bqverse 9>9  Therefore, take note that it is the LORD your God who is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant faithfully<a name="fnB359" href="deu_note.htm#fn359"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> with those who love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations,

<bqverse 25>25  You must burn the images of their gods, but do not covet the silver and gold that covers them so much that you take it for yourself and thus become ensnared by it; for it is abhorrent<a name="fnB378" href="deu_note.htm#fn378"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> to the LORD your God. 
<bqverse 26>26  You must not bring any detestable thing into your house and thereby become an object of divine annihilation<a name="fnB379" href="deu_note.htm#fn379"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> like it is.

<bqverse 11>11  Now at the end of the forty days and nights the LORD presented me with the two stone tablets, the texts<a name="fnB425" href="deu_note.htm#fn425"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> of the covenant. 
<bqverse 12>12  And he<a name="fnB426" href="deu_note.htm#fn426"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> said to me, "Get up, go down from here<a name="fnB427" href="deu_note.htm#fn427"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves! They have quickly turned from the way I commanded them and have made a cast image."<a name="fnB428" href="deu_note.htm#fn428"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  Moreover, he<a name="fnB429" href="deu_note.htm#fn429"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> said to me, "I have taken note of these people, that they are a stubborn<a name="fnB430" href="deu_note.htm#fn430"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> lot! 
<bqverse 14>14  Step aside<a name="fnB431" href="deu_note.htm#fn431"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> and I will annihilate them, obliterating their very name from memory<a name="fnB432" href="deu_note.htm#fn432"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> and making from you a stronger and more numerous nation than they." <p>

<bqverse 15>15  So I turned and descended from the mountain while it was blazing with fire; the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands. 
<bqverse 16>16  When I looked, you had indeed<a name="fnB433" href="deu_note.htm#fn433"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> sinned against the LORD your God and had made a cast calf;<a name="fnB434" href="deu_note.htm#fn434"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> so quickly you had turned aside from the way he<a name="fnB435" href="deu_note.htm#fn435"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> had taught<a name="fnB436" href="deu_note.htm#fn436"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> you! 
<bqverse 17>17  I grabbed the two tablets, threw them down,<a name="fnB437" href="deu_note.htm#fn437"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> and shattered them before your very eyes. 
<bqverse 18>18  Then I fell down before the LORD as at the first time, forty days and nights; I ate and drank nothing<a name="fnB438" href="deu_note.htm#fn438"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> because of all the sin you had committed, doing such wickedness before the LORD as to offend him. 
<bqverse 19>19  For I was terrified at the LORD's intense anger<a name="fnB439" href="deu_note.htm#fn439"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> against you going so far as to destroy you; but he<a name="fnB440" href="deu_note.htm#fn440"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> listened to me then also. 
<bqverse 20>20  The LORD was also angry enough at Aaron to kill him, but at that time I prayed for him also. 
<bqverse 21>21  As for your sinful thing<a name="fnB441" href="deu_note.htm#fn441"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> that you had made, the calf, I took it, melted it down,<a name="fnB442" href="deu_note.htm#fn442"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> ground it up until it was as fine as dust, and tossed the dust into the stream that flows down the mountain. 
<bqverse 22>22  Moreover, you continued to provoke the LORD at Taberah,<a name="fnB443" href="deu_note.htm#fn443"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> Massah,<a name="fnB444" href="deu_note.htm#fn444"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> and Kibroth-Hattaavah.<a name="fnB445" href="deu_note.htm#fn445"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23  And when he<a name="fnB446" href="deu_note.htm#fn446"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> sent you from Kadesh-Barnea and told you, "Go up and possess the land I have given you," you rebelled against the LORD your God and would neither believe nor obey him. 
<bqverse 24>24  You have been rebellious against him<a name="fnB447" href="deu_note.htm#fn447"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> from the very first day I knew you!<a name="_Toc494011685"></a></p>
<p><i>Moses' Plea on Behalf of the LORD's Reputation</i>
<p>
<bqverse 25>25  Thus I lay flat on the ground before the LORD for forty days and nights,<a name="fnB448" href="deu_note.htm#fn448"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> for he<a name="fnB449" href="deu_note.htm#fn449"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> had said he would destroy you. 
<bqverse 26>26  And I prayed to him:<a name="fnB450" href="deu_note.htm#fn450"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> O, Lord GOD,<a name="fnB451" href="deu_note.htm#fn451"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> do not destroy your people, your very inheritance that you have powerfully redeemed,<a name="fnB452" href="deu_note.htm#fn452"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> whom you brought out of Egypt by your mighty strength.<a name="fnB453" href="deu_note.htm#fn453"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; ignore<a name="fnB454" href="deu_note.htm#fn454"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> the stubbornness, wickedness, and sin of these people, 
<bqverse 28>28  lest the people of the land<a name="fnB455" href="deu_note.htm#fn455"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> from which you brought us say, "The LORD was unable to bring them to the land he promised them, and because of his hatred for them he has brought them out to kill them in the desert." 
<bqverse 29>29  They are your people, your inheritance, whom you brought out with great strength and powerful leadership.<a name="fnB456" href="deu_note.htm#fn456"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>The Opportunity to Begin Again</i>
<p><A NAME="10"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> At that same time the LORD said to me, "Carve out for yourself two stone tablets like the first ones and ascend the mountain to me; also make for yourself a wooden ark.<a name="fnB457" href="deu_note.htm#fn457"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  I will write on the tablets the same words<a name="fnB458" href="deu_note.htm#fn458"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> that were on the first tablets you broke, and you must put them into the ark." 
<bqverse 3>3  So I made an ark of acacia<a name="fnB459" href="deu_note.htm#fn459"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> wood and carved out two stone tablets just like the first ones. Then I ascended the mountain with the two tablets in my hands. 
<bqverse 4>4  The LORD<a name="fnB460" href="deu_note.htm#fn460"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> then wrote on the tablets the identical writing<a name="fnB461" href="deu_note.htm#fn461"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> that had been on the first tablets, the ten commandments,<a name="fnB462" href="deu_note.htm#fn462"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> which he<a name="fnB463" href="deu_note.htm#fn463"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> had spoken to you at the mountain from the fire at the time of that convocation, and he<a name="fnB464" href="deu_note.htm#fn464"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> gave them to me. 
<bqverse 5>5  Then I turned, descended the mountain, and placed the tablets into the ark I had made--they are still there, just as the LORD commanded me.<a name="_Toc494011687"></a></p>
<p><i>Conclusion of the Historical Resume</i>
<p>
<bqverse 6>6  During those days<a name="fnB465" href="deu_note.htm#fn465"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene-Yaaqan<a name="fnB466" href="deu_note.htm#fn466"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> to Moserah.<a name="fnB467" href="deu_note.htm#fn467"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> There Aaron died and was buried, and his son Eleazar was made priest in his place. 
<bqverse 7>7  From there they went to Gudgodah,<a name="fnB468" href="deu_note.htm#fn468"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah,<a name="fnB469" href="deu_note.htm#fn469"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> a place of flowing streams. 
<bqverse 8>8  At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi<a name="fnB470" href="deu_note.htm#fn470"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> to carry the ark of the LORD's covenant, to stand before the LORD to serve him, and to render blessing<a name="fnB471" href="deu_note.htm#fn471"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> in his name, as they do to this very day. 
<bqverse 9>9  Therefore Levi has no allotment or inheritance<a name="fnB472" href="deu_note.htm#fn472"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> among his brothers; the LORD is his inheritance just as the LORD your God told him. 
<bqverse 10>10  As for me, I stayed at the mountain as at the first time, forty days and nights. The LORD listened to me that time as well and decided not to destroy you. 
<bqverse 11>11  Then he<a name="fnB473" href="deu_note.htm#fn473"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> said to me, "Get up, set out before the people, and go and possess the land I promised to give to your ancestors."<a name="fnB474" href="deu_note.htm#fn474"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494011688"></a></p>
<p><i>An Exhortation to Love Both God and People</i>
<p>
<bqverse 12>12  Now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you except to fear him,<a name="fnB475" href="deu_note.htm#fn475"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> to walk in all his ways, to love him, and to serve him<a name="fnB476" href="deu_note.htm#fn476"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> with all your mind<a name="fnB477" href="deu_note.htm#fn477"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> and being?<a name="fnB478" href="deu_note.htm#fn478"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  Keep the commandments and statutes of the LORD that I am commanding you today for your own good. 
<bqverse 14>14  The heavens, indeed the highest heavens,<a name="fnB479" href="deu_note.htm#fn479"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> belong to the LORD your God, as does the earth and everything in it. 
<bqverse 15>15  However, only your ancestors did he<a name="fnB480" href="deu_note.htm#fn480"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> decide<a name="fnB481" href="deu_note.htm#fn481"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> to select,<a name="fnB482" href="deu_note.htm#fn482"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> and he chose you, their descendants after them, from all peoples--as is apparent today. 
<bqverse 16>16  Therefore, cleanse<a name="fnB483" href="deu_note.htm#fn483"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> your heart and stop being so stubborn!<a name="fnB484" href="deu_note.htm#fn484"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God and awesome warrior who is unbiased<a name="fnB485" href="deu_note.htm#fn485"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> and takes no bribe, 
<bqverse 18>18  who acts justly toward orphan and widow, and who loves resident foreigners, giving them food and clothing. 
<bqverse 19>19  You, therefore, love the resident foreigner because you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. 
<bqverse 20>20  Revere the LORD your God, serve him, cleave to him and take oaths only in his name. 
<bqverse 21>21  He is the object of your praise and your God, the one who has done these great and awesome things for you that you<a name="fnB486" href="deu_note.htm#fn486"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> have seen. 
<bqverse 22>22  Your ancestors went down to Egypt as only seventy people but now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars of the sky.<a name="fnB487" href="deu_note.htm#fn487"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 11>11  Rather, the land where you are going as your possession is one of hills and valleys, a land that drinks water from the rains,<a name="fnB504" href="deu_note.htm#fn504"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>The Central Sanctuary</i>
<p><A NAME="12"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> These are the statutes and commandments that you must be careful to obey in the land that the LORD, the God of your ancestors,<a name="fnB544" href="deu_note.htm#fn544"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> has given you to possess for as long<a name="fnB545" href="deu_note.htm#fn545"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> as you live in the land. 
<bqverse 2>2  You must by all means destroy all the places there where the nations you are about to dispossess worship their gods--on the high mountains and hills and under every leafy tree.<a name="fnB546" href="deu_note.htm#fn546"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  You must tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars<a name="fnB547" href="deu_note.htm#fn547"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> to pieces, burn up their sacred Asherah poles,<a name="fnB548" href="deu_note.htm#fn548"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and hack up the images of their gods; you must eliminate their very memory<a name="fnB549" href="deu_note.htm#fn549"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> from that place. 
<bqverse 4>4  You must not worship the LORD your God they way they worship.<a name="fnB550" href="deu_note.htm#fn550"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  But you must seek only the place that he<a name="fnB551" href="deu_note.htm#fn551"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> has chosen to establish his name, his place of residence,<a name="fnB552" href="deu_note.htm#fn552"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> and you must go there. 
<bqverse 6>6  And there you must take your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the personal offerings you have prepared,<a name="fnB553" href="deu_note.htm#fn553"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> your votive offerings,<a name="fnB554" href="deu_note.htm#fn554"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks. 
<bqverse 7>7  Both you and your children must feast there before the LORD your God and rejoice in all the output of your labor<a name="fnB555" href="deu_note.htm#fn555"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> with which he<a name="fnB556" href="deu_note.htm#fn556"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> has blessed you. 
<bqverse 8>8  You must not do like we are doing here today, with everyone doing what seems best to him,<a name="fnB557" href="deu_note.htm#fn557"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  for you have not yet come to the final stop<a name="fnB558" href="deu_note.htm#fn558"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> and inheritance the LORD your God is giving you. 
<bqverse 10>10  When you do go across the Jordan River<a name="fnB559" href="deu_note.htm#fn559"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> and settle in the land that he<a name="fnB560" href="deu_note.htm#fn560"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> is granting you as an inheritance,<a name="fnB561" href="deu_note.htm#fn561"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and you find respite from all your surrounding enemies and live in safety, 
<bqverse 11>11  then you must bring to the place the LORD your God will select as the place of residence for his name everything I am commanding you--your burnt offerings, sacrifices, tithes, the personal offerings you have prepared,<a name="fnB562" href="deu_note.htm#fn562"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> and all your choice votive-offerings which you devote to him.<a name="fnB563" href="deu_note.htm#fn563"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  You shall rejoice in the presence of the LORD your God, along with your sons, daughters, male and female servants, and the Levite in your villages<a name="fnB564" href="deu_note.htm#fn564"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> (since he has no allotment or inheritance with you).<a name="fnB565" href="deu_note.htm#fn565"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  Watch yourself carefully lest you offer burnt offerings in any place you wish,<a name="fnB566" href="deu_note.htm#fn566"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  for you may do so<a name="fnB567" href="deu_note.htm#fn567"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> only in the place the LORD chooses in one of your tribal areas<a name="fnB568" href="deu_note.htm#fn568"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a>--there you may do everything I am commanding you.<a name="fnB569" href="deu_note.htm#fn569"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494011694"></a></p>
<p><i>Regulations for Profane Slaughter</i>
<p>
<bqverse 15>15  On the other hand, you may slaughter and eat meat as you please according to the blessing of the LORD your God that he has given you in all your villages.<a name="fnB570" href="deu_note.htm#fn570"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> Both the ritually pure and impure may eat it, whether it be a gazelle or an ibex. 
<bqverse 16>16  However, you must not eat blood; pour it out on the ground like water. 
<bqverse 17>17  You will not be allowed to eat in your villages<a name="fnB571" href="deu_note.htm#fn571"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> your tithe of grain, grape juice, oil, first-born of the herd and flock, any votive-offerings you have vowed, or your freewill and personal offerings. 
<bqverse 18>18  Only in the presence of the LORD your God may you eat these, in the place he<a name="fnB572" href="deu_note.htm#fn572"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> has chosen--both you, your son, your daughter, your male and female servants, and the Levite in your villages.<a name="fnB573" href="deu_note.htm#fn573"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> In that place you will rejoice before the LORD your God in all your activity.<a name="fnB574" href="deu_note.htm#fn574"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  Be careful not to overlook<a name="fnB575" href="deu_note.htm#fn575"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> the Levite as long as you live in the land.<a name="_Toc494011695"></a></p>
<p><i>The Sanctity of Blood</i>
<p>
<bqverse 20>20  When the LORD your God extends your borders as he said he would do and you say, "I want to eat meat just as I please," you may do so as you wish.<a name="fnB576" href="deu_note.htm#fn576"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  If the place he<a name="fnB577" href="deu_note.htm#fn577"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> has chosen to locate his name is too far for you, you may slaughter any of your herd and flock he<a name="fnB578" href="deu_note.htm#fn578"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> has given you just as I have stipulated; you may eat in your villages<a name="fnB579" href="deu_note.htm#fn579"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> just as you wish. 
<bqverse 22>22  Like you eat the gazelle or ibex, so you may eat these; the ritually impure and pure alike may eat them. 
<bqverse 23>23  However, by no means eat the blood, for the blood is life itself;<a name="fnB580" href="deu_note.htm#fn580"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> you must not eat life with its meat! 
<bqverse 24>24  You must not eat it! You must pour it out on the ground like water. 
<bqverse 25>25  You must not eat it so that it may go well with you and your children after you; you will be doing what is right in the LORD's sight.<a name="fnB581" href="deu_note.htm#fn581"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  Only the holy things and votive offerings that belong to you, you must pick up and take to the place the LORD will choose.<a name="fnB582" href="deu_note.htm#fn582"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  You must offer your burnt offerings, meat and blood, on the altar of the LORD your God; the blood of your other sacrifices<a name="fnB583" href="deu_note.htm#fn583"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> you must pour out on his<a name="fnB584" href="deu_note.htm#fn584"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> altar while you eat the meat. 
<bqverse 28>28  Pay utmost attention to these things that I am commanding you so that it may go well with you and your descendants forever--that is, do what is good and right in the sight of the LORD your God.<a name="_Toc494011696"></a></p>
<p><i>The Abomination of Pagan Gods</i>
<p>
<bqverse 29>29  After the LORD your God has cut off the nations from the place where you are going to dispossess them and you do so and settle down in their land, 
<bqverse 30>30  be careful not to be ensnared like they are,<a name="fnB585" href="deu_note.htm#fn585"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> after they have been destroyed from your presence, and pursue their gods and say, "How do these nations serve their gods? I myself will do the same." 
<bqverse 31>31  You must not do this against the LORD your God! For everything abominable to him,<a name="fnB586" href="deu_note.htm#fn586"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> everything he hates, they have done for their gods. They even burn up<a name="fnB587" href="deu_note.htm#fn587"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> their sons and daughters to their gods!<a name="_Toc494011697"></a></p>

<bqverse 13>13  If a man marries<a name="fnB964" href="deu_note.htm#fn964"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> a wife, has sexual intercourse with her, and then rejects<a name="fnB965" href="deu_note.htm#fn965"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> her, 
<bqverse 14>14  accusing her of impropriety<a name="fnB966" href="deu_note.htm#fn966"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> and defaming her reputation<a name="fnB967" href="deu_note.htm#fn967"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> by saying, "I married this woman but when I became intimate<a name="fnB968" href="deu_note.htm#fn968"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> with her I discovered she was not a virgin," 
<bqverse 15>15  then the father and mother of the young woman must obtain and exhibit<a name="fnB969" href="deu_note.htm#fn969"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> the evidence of virginity<a name="fnB970" href="deu_note.htm#fn970"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> for the elders of the city at the gate. 
<bqverse 16>16  The young woman's father must say to the elders, "I gave my daughter to this man and he has rejected<a name="fnB971" href="deu_note.htm#fn971"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> her. 
<bqverse 17>17  Moreover, he has raised accusations of impropriety by saying, `I did not find your daughter to be a virgin,' but this is the evidence of my daughter's virginity!" The cloth must then be spread out<a name="fnB972" href="deu_note.htm#fn972"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> before the city's elders. 
<bqverse 18>18  The elders of that city will then seize the man and punish<a name="fnB973" href="deu_note.htm#fn973"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> him. 
<bqverse 19>19  They will fine him one hundred shekels of silver and give them to the young woman's father, for the man who made the accusation<a name="fnB974" href="deu_note.htm#fn974"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> ruined the reputation of an Israelite virgin. She will then become his wife and he may never divorce her<a name="fnB975" href="deu_note.htm#fn975"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> as long as he lives. <p>

<bqverse 20>20  But if it is true that the young woman could produce no evidence of virginity, 
<bqverse 21>21  the men of her city must bring the young woman to the door of her father's house and stone her to death, for she has done a foolish thing<a name="fnB976" href="deu_note.htm#fn976"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> in Israel by behaving like a prostitute while living in her father's house; thus you will purge<a name="fnB977" href="deu_note.htm#fn977"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> evil from among you. <p>

<bqverse 22>22  If a man is caught<a name="fnB978" href="deu_note.htm#fn978"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> having sexual relations with a married woman<a name="fnB979" href="deu_note.htm#fn979"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> both the man who had sex with the woman and the woman herself must die; thus you will purge<a name="fnB980" href="deu_note.htm#fn980"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> evil from Israel.<p>

<bqverse 23>23  If a virgin is engaged to a man and another man finds her in the city and has sex with her, 
<bqverse 24>24  you must bring the two of them to the gate of that city and stone them to death, the young woman because she did not cry out though in the city and the man because he violated<a name="fnB981" href="deu_note.htm#fn981"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> his neighbor's fianc&eacute;e; thus you will purge<a name="fnB982" href="deu_note.htm#fn982"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> evil from among you. 
<bqverse 25>25  But if the man found the engaged woman in the field and seized her and raped<a name="fnB983" href="deu_note.htm#fn983"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> her, then only the man who did this<a name="fnB984" href="deu_note.htm#fn984"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> must die. 
<bqverse 26>26  You must not do anything to the young woman--she has done nothing deserving of death; for just as someone<a name="fnB985" href="deu_note.htm#fn985"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> attacks another person<a name="fnB986" href="deu_note.htm#fn986"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> and kills him, so is this case, 
<bqverse 27>27  for the man<a name="fnB987" href="deu_note.htm#fn987"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> found her in the field and the engaged woman cried out, but there was no one to rescue her.<p>

<bqverse 28>28  If a man comes across<a name="fnB988" href="deu_note.htm#fn988"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> a virgin who is not engaged and overpowers<a name="fnB989" href="deu_note.htm#fn989"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> and rapes her and they are discovered, 
<bqverse 29>29  the man who has raped her must pay her<a name="fnB990" href="deu_note.htm#fn990"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> father fifty shekels of silver and she must become his wife because he has violated her; he may never divorce her as long as he lives.<p>

<p><i>Purity in the Treatment of the Nonprivileged</i>

<bqverse 3>3  the great testings that you yourselves<a name="fnB1275" href="deu_note.htm#fn1275"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> saw, those signs and mighty<a name="fnB1276" href="deu_note.htm#fn1276"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> wonders. 
<bqverse 4>4  But to this very day the LORD has not given you an understanding mind,<a name="fnB1277" href="deu_note.htm#fn1277"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> perceptive eyes, or discerning ears! 
<bqverse 5>5  I have led you in the desert for forty years. Your clothing has not worn out<a name="fnB1278" href="deu_note.htm#fn1278"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> nor have your sandals<a name="fnB1279" href="deu_note.htm#fn1279"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> deteriorated. 
<bqverse 6>6  You have eaten no bread and drunk no wine or beer--all so that you might know that I<a name="fnB1280" href="deu_note.htm#fn1280"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> am the LORD your God! 
<bqverse 7>7  When you came to this place King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan came out to make war<a name="fnB1281" href="deu_note.htm#fn1281"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> and we defeated them.<a name="fnB1282" href="deu_note.htm#fn1282"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  Then we took their land and gave it as an inheritance to Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh.<a name="_Toc494011748"></a></p>
<p><i>The Present Covenant Setting</i>
<p>
<bqverse 9>9  "Therefore, keep the terms<a name="fnB1283" href="deu_note.htm#fn1283"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> of this covenant and obey them so that you may be successful in everything you do. 
<bqverse 10>10  You are standing today, all of you, before the LORD your God--the heads of your tribes,<a name="fnB1284" href="deu_note.htm#fn1284"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> your elders, your officials, every Israelite,

<bqverse 12>12  so that you may enter into the covenant of the LORD your God and into the benefits of the oath that the LORD is making with you today, 
<bqverse 13>13  to affirm you today as his people and himself as your God just as he said to you and already swore to your ancestors,<a name="fnB1286" href="deu_note.htm#fn1286"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
<bqverse 14>14  And it is not with you alone that I am making this covenant and oath, 
<bqverse 15>15  but with whoever stands with us here today before the LORD your God as well as those not with us here today.<a name="_Toc494011749"></a></p>
<p><i>The Results of Disobedience</i>
<p>
<bqverse 16>16  "(For you know how we lived in the land of Egypt and how we crossed through the nations that we traversed. 
<bqverse 17>17  And you have seen their detestable things<a name="fnB1287" href="deu_note.htm#fn1287"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> and idols--the wood, stone, silver, and gold that were with them.) 
<bqverse 18>18  Beware that there is no man, woman, clan, or tribe among you whose heart is turning away from the LORD our God today to go and serve the gods of those nations; beware that there is among you no root producing poisonous and bitter fruit.<a name="fnB1288" href="deu_note.htm#fn1288"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  When such a person<a name="fnB1289" href="deu_note.htm#fn1289"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> hears the words of this oath he blesses himself within<a name="fnB1290" href="deu_note.htm#fn1290"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and says, I will have peace though I continue to walk with a stubborn spirit,<a name="fnB1291" href="deu_note.htm#fn1291"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> thus destroying the watered ground with the parched.<a name="fnB1292" href="deu_note.htm#fn1292"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  The LORD will be unwilling to forgive him, and his zealous wrath<a name="fnB1293" href="deu_note.htm#fn1293"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> will smoke against that man; all the curses written in this book will fall down on him<a name="fnB1294" href="deu_note.htm#fn1294"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> and the LORD will blot his very remembrance<a name="fnB1295" href="deu_note.htm#fn1295"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> out from under heaven. 
<bqverse 21>21  Then the LORD will select<a name="fnB1296" href="deu_note.htm#fn1296"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> him from all the tribes of Israel for catastrophe<a name="fnB1297" href="deu_note.htm#fn1297"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> according to all the curses of the covenant written in this book of the law. 
<bqverse 22>22  And the generation to come--your descendants who will rise up after you as well as the foreigner who will come from distant places--will say when they see the afflictions of that land and the illnesses that the LORD has brought on it, 
<bqverse 23>23  and that the whole land is brimstone, salt, and burning waste, not planted or sprouting or producing grass, like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the LORD destroyed in his fury and rage, 
<bqverse 24>24  all the nations will ask, "Why has the LORD done all this to this land? What is this fierce, heated display of anger all about?" 
<bqverse 25>25  Then people will say, "Because they abandoned the covenant of the LORD, the God of their ancestors, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. 
<bqverse 26>26  They went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods they had not known and that he had not allowed<a name="fnB1298" href="deu_note.htm#fn1298"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> them-- 
<bqverse 27>27  that is why the LORD's anger broke out against this land, bringing<a name="fnB1299" href="deu_note.htm#fn1299"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> on it all the curses written in this book. 
<bqverse 28>28  So the LORD has uprooted them from their land in anger, wrath, and great rage and has deported them to another land, as is clear<a name="fnB1300" href="deu_note.htm#fn1300"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> today." 
<bqverse 29>29  Secret things belong to the LORD our God but those that are revealed to us and our descendants forever are shown so that we might accomplish all the words of this law.

<bqverse 3>3  As for the LORD your God, he is about to cross over before you; he will destroy these nations before you and dispossess them. As for Joshua, he is about to cross before you just as the LORD has said. 
<bqverse 4>4  The LORD will do to them just what he did to Sihon and Og, the Amorite kings, and to their land, which he destroyed. 
<bqverse 5>5  The LORD will deliver them over to you and you will do to them according to the whole commandment I have given you. 
<bqverse 6>6  Be strong and bold! Do not fear or tremble before them, for the LORD your God is the one who is going with you. He will not fail you or abandon you!"

<bqverse 10>10  He<a name="fnB1342" href="deu_note.htm#fn1342"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> commanded them: "At the end of seven years, at the appointed time of the release,<a name="fnB1343" href="deu_note.htm#fn1343"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> at the Feast of Temporary Shelters,<a name="fnB1344" href="deu_note.htm#fn1344"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>The Commissioning of Joshua</i>

<bqverse 15>15  The LORD appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud that<a name="fnB1350" href="deu_note.htm#fn1350"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> stood above the door of the tent. 
<bqverse 16>16  And the LORD said to Moses, "You are about to die,<a name="fnB1351" href="deu_note.htm#fn1351"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> and then these people will begin to prostitute themselves with the foreign gods of the land into which they<a name="fnB1352" href="deu_note.htm#fn1352"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> are going.

<bqverse 26>26  "Take this scroll of the law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God. It will be there as a witness against you,

<bqverse 29>29  For I know that after I die you will totally corrupt yourselves and turn away from the path I have commanded you to walk. Disaster will confront you in the days to come because you will act wickedly before the LORD, inciting him to wrath because of your works." 
<bqverse 30>30  Then Moses recited the words of this song from start to finish<a name="fnB1384" href="deu_note.htm#fn1384"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> in the hearing<a name="fnB1385" href="deu_note.htm#fn1385"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> of the whole assembly of Israel.

<p><A NAME="34"><b>

<bqverse 2>2 and all of Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the distant<a name="fnB1500" href="deu_note.htm#fn1500"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> sea, 
<bqverse 3>3 the Negev, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of the date palm trees, as far as Zoar. 
<bqverse 4>4 Then the LORD said to him, "This is the land I promised<a name="fnB1501" href="deu_note.htm#fn1501"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob when I said, `I will give it to your descendants.' I have let you see it with your own eyes but you will not cross over there." <p>

<bqverse 5>5 So Moses, servant of the LORD, died there in the land of Moab as the LORD had said.<a name="fnB1502" href="deu_note.htm#fn1502"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 8>8 The Israelites mourned over<a name="fnB1506" href="deu_note.htm#fn1506"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> Moses in the deserts of Moab for thirty days; then the days of weeping in mourning for Moses were completed.<a name="_Toc494011777"></a></p>

<bqverse 11>11  with all the signs and wonders the LORD had sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, all his servants, and the whole land,
