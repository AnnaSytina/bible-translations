 <b>tc</b> (1:1)  The textual problems in Hosea are virtually unparalleled in the OT. The Masoretic Text (MT), represented by the Leningrad Codex (ca. A.D. 1008), which served as the basis for both <i>BHK</i> and <i>BHS</i>, and the Aleppo Codex (ca. A.D. 952), are textually corrupt by all accounts and have a multitude of scribal errors. Many medieval Masoretic MSS preserve textual variants that differ from the Leningrad and Aleppo Codices. The Qumran materials (4QXII<sup>c,d,g</sup>) contain numerous textual variants that differ from the MT; unfortunately, these texts are quite fragmentary (frequently in the very place that an important textual problem appears). The textual tradition and translation quality of the LXX and the early Greek recensions (Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion) is mixed; in some places they are inferior to the MT but in other places they preserve a better reading. The textual apparatus of <i>BHK</i> and <i>BHS</i> contains many proposed emendations based on the versions (Greek, Syriac, Latin, Aramaic) that often appear to be superior readings than what is preserved in the MT. In numerous cases, the MT readings are so difficult morphologically, syntactically, and contextually that conservative conjectural emendations are necessary to make sense of the text. Most major English translations (e.g., KJV, NKJV, NEB, RSV, NRSV, ASV, NASB, NJPS, NIV, TEV, CEV) adopt either occasionally or frequently textual variants reflected in the versions and occasionally adopt conservative conjectural emendations proposed in <i>BHK</i> and/or <i>BHS</i>. However, many of the textual problems in Hosea are so difficult that the English translations frequently are split among themselves. With this in mind, the present translation of Hosea must necessarily be viewed as only preliminary. Further work on the text and translation of Hosea is needed, not only in terms of the NET Bible but in Hosea studies in general. Perhaps the text of Hosea will be better clarified when the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project completes work on the book of Hosea. For further study of textual problems in Hosea, see D. Barthelemy<i>, Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i> (New York: United Bible Societies, 1980), 5:228-71.<br>

 <a name="fn5" href="hos.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:2) The construct noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tLjt</FONT> ("beginning of") displays a wider use of the construct state here, preceding a perfect verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rbD</FONT> "he spoke" (Piel perfect 3ms) rather than a genitive noun. This is an unusual temporal construction (GKC &#167;130.<i>d</i>). It may be rendered, "When he (= the LORD) began to speak." This time-determinative was not correctly understood by the LXX or by the KJV: "The beginning of the word of the LORD."<br>

This focuses on the entire prophetic revelation through Hosea to Israel.<br>

 <a name="fn10" href="hos.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:2) <i>Heb</i> "a wife of harlotries." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnz</FONT> means "prostitute; harlot" (<i>HALOT</i> 1:275). The term does not refer to mere adultery which is expressed by the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[an</FONT> ("adultery"); cf. <i>HALOT</i> 2:658. The plural noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ynWnz </FONT>(literally, "harlotries") is an example of the plural of character or plural of repeated behavior. The phrase "wife of harlotries" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ynWnz tva</FONT>) probably refers to a prostitute, possibly a temple prostitute serving at a Baal temple.<br>
 <a name="fn11" href="hos.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:2) <i>Heb</i> "and children of harlotries."<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="hos.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:2) <i>Heb</i> "the land." The term "the land" is frequently used as a synecdoche of container (= the land of Israel) for the contained (= the people of Israel).<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="hos.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:2) <i>Heb</i> "prostitution." The construction <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnzt hnz </FONT>(infinitive absolute + imperfect of the same root) repeats the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnz </FONT>("harlotry") for rhetorical emphasis. Israel was guilty of gross spiritual prostitution by apostatizing away from Yahweh. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnz</FONT> is used in a concrete sense to refer to a spouse being unfaithful in a marriage relationship (<i>HALOT</i> 1:275.1), and figuratively "to be unfaithful" in a relationship with God by prostituting themselves with other gods and worshiping idols (Exod 34:15; Lev 17:7; 20:5, 6; Deut 31:16; Judg 8:27, 33; 21:17; 1 Chr 5:25; Ezek 6:9; 20:30; 23:30; Hos 4:15; Ps 106:39) (<i>HALOT</i> 1:275.2).<br>

 <a name="fn15" href="hos.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:3) <i>Heb</i> "so he went and took" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jQYw ElYw</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn16" href="hos.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:4) <i>Heb</i> "I will visit." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dqP</FONT> ("to visit") has a very broad range of meanings: (1) "to pay attention to; to look at" (a) favorably: to look after; to provide for; to care for; (b) unfavorably: to seek vengeance for; to punish for; (2) militarily: (a) "to muster; to enroll"; (b) "to inspect; to review"; (3) leadership: (a) "to rule over; to oversee"; (b) Hiphil: "to appoint an overseer" (see BDB 823; <i>HALOT</i> 3:955-58). In this context, the nuance "to punish" or "to take vengeance" (see 1b above) is most appropriate.<br>
 <a name="fn17" href="hos.htm#fnB17"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:4) <i>Heb</i> "house."<br>
 <a name="fn18" href="hos.htm#fnB18"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:4) The plural form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;D</FONT> ("blood") refers to "bloodshed" (BDB 196.f). This is an example of a plural of abnormal condition (GKC &#167;124.<i>n</i>). The plural is used to represent natural objects which are found in an unnatural or abnormal condition. The plural is used because the natural object is normally found as a whole or in one unit; but in the abnormal condition the object is found in many parts. Normally, blood is contained as a whole within the body. However, when a brutal murder occurs, blood is shed and literally spilled all over the place.<br>
 <a name="fn19" href="hos.htm#fnB19"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:4) <i>Heb</i> "I will visit the bloodshed of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu."<br>

 <a name="fn21" href="hos.htm#fnB21"><sup>22</sup></a><b>sn </b> (1:4) The proper name <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">laurzy</FONT> ("Jezreel") sounds like <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">larcy</FONT> ("Israel"). This phonetic wordplay associates the sin at Jezreel with the judgment on Israel, stressing poetic justice.<br>
 <a name="fn22" href="hos.htm#fnB22"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:5) <i>Heb</i> "in that day."<br>
 <a name="fn23" href="hos.htm#fnB23"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:5) <i>Heb</i> "I will break the bow." The phrase "break the bow" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tvq-ta yTrbvw</FONT>) is figurative. The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tvq </FONT>("bow") frequently refers to the warrior's weapon (2 Sam 22:35; Ps 18:35; Job 20:24; Hos 2:20; Zech 9:10; 10:4). The reference to the warrior's bow is a synecdoche of specific (bow) for general (military weaponry or power) (see <i>HALOT</i> 3:1155.3). The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tvq</FONT> ("bow") is used figuratively for "power" several times (e.g., Gen 49:24; 1 Sam 2:4; Jer 49:35; Job 29:20; Ps 37:15) (BDB 906.1e).<br>

 <a name="fn26" href="hos.htm#fnB26"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:6) <i>Heb</i> "house."<br>
 <a name="fn27" href="hos.htm#fnB27"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:6) The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK</FONT> probably denotes cause or result here (GKC &#167;166.<i>c</i>; BDB 473.3.c). <br>
 <a name="fn28" href="hos.htm#fnB28"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:6) The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">acn</FONT> ("to take away") frequently denotes "to forgive" = to take away sin (BDB 671.3c). The construction <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aCa acn</FONT> (infinitive absolute + imperfect of the same root) repeats the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">acn</FONT> ("to forgive") for rhetorical emphasis, stressing the divine resolution not to forgive Israel. <br>
 <a name="fn29" href="hos.htm#fnB29"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:6) The phrase "their guilt" does not appear in Hebrew, but is supplied in the translation for clarification. The ellipsis of the accusative direct object of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aCa acn</FONT> ("I will certainly take away") is an example of brachyology. The accusative "guilt" must be supplied frequently with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">acn</FONT> (see BDB 671.3c) (e.g., Num 14:19; Isa 2:9; Ps 99:8).<br>
 <a name="fn30" href="hos.htm#fnB30"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:7) <i>Heb</i> "house."<br>
 <a name="fn31" href="hos.htm#fnB31"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:7) The word order in this line is rhetorical, emphasizing the divine decision to withhold pity from Israel but to bestow it upon Judah. The accusative (direct object), which is introduced by a disjunctive <i>vav</i> (to denote contrast), appears before the verb: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;jra hdWdy tyB-taw</FONT> (<i>Heb</i> "but upon the house of Judah I will show pity").<br>
 <a name="fn32" href="hos.htm#fnB32"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:7) <i>Heb</i> "by war."<br>
 <a name="fn33" href="hos.htm#fnB33"><sup>34</sup></a><b>sn </b> (1:7) These military weapons are examples of the metonymy of adjunct for subject (= warfare).<br>
 <a name="fn34" href="hos.htm#fnB34"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:8) The preterite <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lmgTw</FONT> (literally, "and she weaned") functions in a synchronic sense with the following preterite <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rhTw</FONT> (literally, "and she conceived") and may be treated in translation as a dependent temporal clause: "When she had weaned...she conceived."<br>
 <a name="fn35" href="hos.htm#fnB35"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  <i>Heb</i> "Then he said"; the referent (the LORD) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>

The emendation creates a tighter parallel with the preceding <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yMu al &lt;Ta</FONT> ("you are not my people"). The MT should be retained.<br>
 <b>tn </b> (1:9) <i>Heb</i> "I am not yours." The divine name "God" is supplied in the translation.<br>
 <b>sn </b> (1:9) This is an allusion to Yahweh's promise to Moses <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Emu hyha</FONT> ("I will be with you") (Exod 3:12, 14). In effect, it is a negation of Exod 3:12, 14 and a cancellation of Israel's status as vassal of Yahweh in the conditional Mosaic covenant.<br>
 <a name="fn39" href="hos.htm#fnB39"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn </b> (2:1) Beginning with <b>1:10</b>, the verse numbers through <b>2:23</b> in the English Bible differ by two from the verse numbers in the Hebrew text (<i>BHS</i>), with <b>1:10 </b>ET = <b>2:1</b> HT, <b>1:11 </b>ET = <b>2:2</b> HT, <b>2:1</b> ET = <b>2:3</b> HT, etc., through <b>2:23</b> ET = <b>2:25</b> HT.

 <a name="fn42" href="hos.htm#fnB42"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:1) <i>Heb</i> "in the place" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;wqmB</FONT>). BDB suggests that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;wqmB</FONT> (preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B</FONT> + noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;wqm</FONT>) is an idiom carrying a concessive sense: "instead of" (BDB 880.7b) (e.g., Isa 33:21; Hos 2:1). However, <i>HALOT</i> suggests that it functions in a locative sense: "in the same place" (<i>HALOT</i> 2:626.2b) (e.g., 1 Kgs 21:19; Isa 33:21; Hos 2:1).<br>
 <a name="fn43" href="hos.htm#fnB43"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:1) The predicate nominative, "You are...," is supplied in the translation.<br>

 <a name="fn47" href="hos.htm#fnB47"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:11) Alternatively, "gain possession of the land" or "rise up from the land." This clause may be understood in two ways: (1) Israel will gain ascendancy over the land or conquer the land (e.g., Exod 1:10) or (2) Israel will be "planted" in the land (Hos 2:24-25).<br>
 <a name="fn48" href="hos.htm#fnB48"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:11) Or "For."<br>
 <a name="fn49" href="hos.htm#fnB49"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:1) <i>Heb</i> "Say to...." The imperative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wrma</FONT> (Qal imperative mpl) functions rhetorically, as an example of erotesis of one verbal form (imperative) for another (indicative). The imperative is used as a rhetorical device to emphasize the certainty of a future action.<br>
 <a name="fn50" href="hos.htm#fnB50"><sup>12</sup></a><b>sn </b> (2:1) The suffixes on the nouns <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;kyja</FONT> ("your brother") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;kytwja</FONT> ("your sister") are both plural forms. The brother/sister imagery is being applied to Israel and Judah collectively. <br>
 <a name="fn51" href="hos.htm#fnB51"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:2) <i>Heb</i> "Plead with your mother, plead!" The imperative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wbyr</FONT> ("plead!") is repeated twice in this line for emphasis. This rhetorical expression is handled in a woodenly literal sense by most translations: "Plead...plead!" (NRSV) or "Contend...contend!" (NASB). <br>
 <a name="fn52" href="hos.htm#fnB52"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn </b> (2:2) The suffix on the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;kMa</FONT> ("your mother") is a plural form (2 mpl). The children of Gomer represent the "children" (= people) of Israel; Gomer represents the nation as a whole.<br>
 <a name="fn53" href="hos.htm#fnB53"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:2) The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK</FONT> introduces a parenthetical explanatory clause. <br>
 <b>sn </b> (2:2) The reason that Hosea (representing the LORD) calls upon his children (representing the children of Israel) to plead with Gomer (representing the nation as a whole), rather than pleading directly with her himself, is because Hosea (= the LORD) has turned his back on his unfaithful wife (= Israel). He no longer has a relationship with her ("for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband") because she abandoned him for her lovers.<br>
 <a name="fn54" href="hos.htm#fnB54"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:2) The dependent volitive sequence of imperative followed by <i>vav</i> + jussive (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wbyr</FONT> followed by <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rstw</FONT>) creates a purpose clause: "so that she might turn away." Purpose clauses in contemporary English are frequently translated by an English infinitive, and that has been followed in the translation for stylistic reasons.<br>
 <a name="fn55" href="hos.htm#fnB55"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:2) <i>Heb</i> "put away her adulteries from her face." The plural noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hynWnz</FONT> ("adulteries") is an example of the plural of repeated (or habitual) action: she has had multiple adulterous affairs.<br>
 <a name="fn56" href="hos.htm#fnB56"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:2) <i>Heb</i> "[put away] her immoral behavior from between her breasts."<br>
 <a name="fn57" href="hos.htm#fnB57"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:3) <i>Heb</i> "and kill her with thirst." The <i>vav</i> prefixed to the verb (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hyTmhw</FONT>) introduces a purpose/result clause: "in order to make her die of thirst" (purpose) or "and thus make her die of thirst" (result).<br>
 <a name="fn58" href="hos.htm#fnB58"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:4) <i>Heb</i> "her sons."<br>
 <b>sn </b> (2:4) The word order is rhetorical: the accusative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hynB-taw</FONT> ("her sons") is thrown forward.<br>
 <a name="fn59" href="hos.htm#fnB59"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:4) <i>Heb</i> "sons of adulteries."<br>
 <b>sn </b> (2:4) The word order is rhetorical: the construct clause <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ynWnz ynb </FONT>("sons of adulteries"), which functions as the predicate nominative, is thrown forward, before the independent personal pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hMh </FONT>("they"), which functions as the subject, to focus on the immoral character of her children.<br>
 <a name="fn60" href="hos.htm#fnB60"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:5) <i>Heb</i> "I will go after."<br>
 <a name="fn61" href="hos.htm#fnB61"><sup>23</sup></a><b>sn </b> (2:5) This statement alludes to the practice of sexual rites in the Canaanite fertility cult which attempted to secure agricultural fertility from the Canaanite gods.<br>

 <a name="fn65" href="hos.htm#fnB65"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:6) <i>Heb</i> "I will wall in her wall." The cognate accusative construction <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">HrdG-ta yTrdgw</FONT> ("I will wall in her wall") is an emphatic literary device. The 3fs suffix on the noun functions as a dative of disadvantage: "as a wall against her" (Davidson, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 3 remark 2). The expression means "I will build a wall to bar her way." It is handled variously: "I will make a wall" (KJV), "I will build a wall" (TEV), "I will build a wall against her" (RSV, NRSV, NASB), "I will wall her in" (NIV). <br>
 <a name="fn66" href="hos.htm#fnB66"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:6) The disjunctive clause (object followed by negated verb) introduces a purpose/result clause.<br>

 <a name="fn69" href="hos.htm#fnB69"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:7) In the Hebrew text the accusative direct object pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ta</FONT> ("them") is omitted/elided for balanced poetic parallelism. The LXX supplies <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aujtou"</FONT> ("them"); but it is not necessary to emend the MT because this is a poetic literary convention, not a textual problem.<br>
 <a name="fn70" href="hos.htm#fnB70"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:7) <i>Heb</i> "I will go and return." The two verbs joined with <i>vav</i> form a verbal hendiadys. Normally, the first verb functions adverbially and the second retains its full verbal sense (GKC &#167;&#167;120.<i>d</i>, <i>h</i>). The Hebrew phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbWvaw hkla</FONT> ("I will go and I will return") connotes, "I will return again." As cohortatives, both verbs emphasize the resolution of the speaker. <br>
 <a name="fn71" href="hos.htm#fnB71"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:7) <i>Heb</i> "to my man, the first."<br>

The Israelites were literally uncovering their nakedness in temple prostitution in the Baal fertility cult rituals.

This wordplay is especially effective because the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">luB</FONT> can refer to one's husband and is also the name of the Canaanite storm god Baal. Referring to a spouse the term normally means "husband; master." It was a common, ordinary, non-pejorative term that was frequently used in an interchangeable manner with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vya</FONT> ("husband; man"). Due to its similarity in sound to the abhorrent Canaanite fertility god Baal, the repentant Israelites would be so spiritually sensitive that they would refrain from even uttering this neutral term for fear of recalling their former idolatry.

The first two terms in the triad <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmjlmW brjw tvqw</FONT> (literally, "bow and sword and warfare") are examples of synecdoche of specific (= bow and sword) for general (= weapons of warfare).

It can refer to the suzerain's acknowledgment of his covenant obligations to his vassal or to the vassal's acknowledgment of his covenant obligations to his suzerain. When used in reference to a vassal, the verb "know" is metonymical (cause for effect) for "obey." See H. Huffmann, "Treaty Background of Hebrew YADA&#180;," <i>BASOR</i> 181.<br>

 <a name="fn120" href="hos.htm#fnB120"><sup>82</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:21) <i>Heb</i> "and they." The plural pronoun is used because it refers back to the term translated "sky," which is a dual form in Hebrew.<br>
 <a name="fn121" href="hos.htm#fnB121"><sup>83</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:22) <i>Heb</i> "Jezreel."<b> </b>The use of the name <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">laurzy</FONT> ("Jezreel") creates a powerful three-fold wordplay: (1) The proper name <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">laurzy</FONT> ("Jezreel") is a phonetic wordplay on the similar sounding name <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">larcy</FONT> ("Israel"): God will answer Israel, that is, Jezreel. (2) The name <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">laurzy</FONT> ("Jezreel") plays on the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">urz</FONT> ("to sow, plant"), the immediately following word: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hyTurzW</FONT> (<i>vav</i> + Qal perfect 1cs + 3fs suffix: "I will sow/plant her"). This wordplay creates a popular etymology for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">laurzy</FONT> meaning, "God sows/plants," which fits well into the agricultural fertility imagery in 2:21-23 [2:23-25]. (3) This positive connotation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">laurzy</FONT> ("Jezreel") in 2:21-23[23-25] reverses the negative connotation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">laurzy</FONT> ("Jezreel") in 1:4-5 (bloodshed of Jehu in the Jezreel Valley).<br>
 <a name="fn122" href="hos.htm#fnB122"><sup>84</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:23) <i>Heb</i> "for myself."<br>
 <a name="fn123" href="hos.htm#fnB123"><sup>85</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:23)  The Hebrew text, carrying out the reference to the son born in 1:8-9, uses the third masculine singular pronoun here; some English translations use third plural ("they") in keeping with the immediate context, which refers to reestablished Israel (cf.

 <a name="fn124" href="hos.htm#fnB124"><sup>86</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:23)  The words "You are" do not appear in the Hebrew text, but are implied. It is necessary to supply the phrase in the translation to prevent the reader from understanding the predicate "my God" as an exclamation.<br>

 <b>tn </b> (3:1) <i>Heb</i> "a woman who is loved by a companion" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ur tbha hVa</FONT>). The substantival participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tbha</FONT> ("one who is loved") is in apposition to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hVa</FONT> ("a woman"). The genitive noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ur</FONT> ("companion") functions as the agent of the preceding construct noun: "who is loved by a companion" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ur tbha</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn128" href="hos.htm#fnB128"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:1) The meaning of the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ur</FONT> is debated because it has a broad range of meanings: (1) "friend," (2) "lover," (3) "companion," (4) "neighbor," and (5) "another" (<i>HALOT</i> 3:1255; BDB 945-46). The Hebrew lexicons favor the nuance "lover; paramour" here (<i>HALOT</i> 3:1255.2; BDB 946.1). Most scholars adopt the same approach; however, a few suggest that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ur</FONT> does not refer to another man, but to her husband (= Hosea). Both approaches are reflected in English translations: "a woman who is loved by her husband" (NASB), "though she is loved by another" (NIV), "a woman who is beloved of a paramour" (RSV), "a woman beloved of her friend" (KJV), "a woman who, while befriended by a companion" (NJPS), "a woman who is committing adultery with a lover" (TEV), "an unfaithful woman who has a lover" (CEV).<br>

The Messiah is frequently pictured as the "New David" because he would fulfill the ideals of the Davidic covenant and be everything that David and his descendants were commissioned to be (e.g., Isa 9:7<sup>6</sup>; 16:5; Jer 23:5-6; 30:9; 33:15-16; Ezek 34:23-24; 37:24-25).<br>

The term in Hosea refers to a covenant lawsuit in which Yahweh the suzerain lodges a legal case against his disobedient vassal, accusing Israel and Judah of breach of covenant which will elicit the covenant curses.<br>

Several text-critics suggest that the text be emended to read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/hk ybyr ;Muw </FONT>"My contention is with/against you, O priest!" This involves (1) the revocalization of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;Mu</FONT> ("your people") to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;Mu </FONT>("with/against you") and (2) positing dittography (letter written twice instead of once) of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">k</FONT> (<i>kaf</i>) between original <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ybyr ;Muw</FONT> to create <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ybyrk ;Muw</FONT> (MT).

 <b>tn </b> (4:4) The singular noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/hK</FONT> ("priest") may be understood as a singular of number, referring to a singular individual (perhaps the high priest); however, it is more likely that it functions as a collective singular, referring to the priesthood as a whole (e.g., 4:7-10).

However, an alternate scribal tradition (<i>tiqquneh sopherim</i>, that is, an intentional scribal change when the Masoretes believed that the received consonantal reading was corrupt) preserves the reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wrymh</FONT> "they have exchanged" (Hiphil perfect 3cpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rrm</FONT>). This alternate scribal tradition is also found in the Targum and reflected in the Syriac Peshitta. Several translations follow the MT: "I will change their glory into shame" (KJV, RSV, NASB) and "I will turn your honor into disgrace" (TEV); however, others adopt the alternate tradition: "they changed their glory into shame" (NRSV) and "they exchanged their Glory for something shameful" (NIV).

The similarity between Israel and a stubborn heifer is emphasized by the repetition of the same term. <br>
 <a name="fn162" href="hos.htm#fnB162"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:16)  The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hTu</FONT> often refers to the imminent or the impending future: "very soon" (BDB 774.1b). In Hosea it normally introduces imminent judgment (Hos 2:12; 4:16; 5:7; 8:8, 13; 10:2).<br>
 <a name="fn163" href="hos.htm#fnB163"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:16)  Or "How can the LORD feed them like a lamb in a meadow?" The syntax of this line is difficult and has been understood in two ways: (1) declarative statement as an announcement of judgment (BDB 774.1b): "Now the LORD will feed them like a lamb in the broad field" and (2) rhetorical question lamenting the uncooperative spirit of Israel: "How can the LORD feed them like a lamb in a meadow?"), designed to produce a negative answer ("He cannot feed them...!"). However, this statement lacks an explicit interrogative marker. Although Hosea occasionally asks a rhetorical question without an explicit interrogative marker (e.g., 10:9; 13:14a), he normally does use a rhetorical particle to introduce rhetorical questions (e.g., 6:4; 8:5; 9:5, 14; 11:8; 13:9-10, 14b). Elsewhere, Hosea uses the introductory temporal adverb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hTu</FONT> ("soon") to introduce announcements of imminent future judgment (2:12; 4:16; 5:7; 8:8, 13; 10:2) and accusations of sin (5:3; 13:2). Although Israel has been as rebellious as a stubborn heifer, the LORD will indeed gain control of Israel: they will be like lambs (weakened and defeated) when he puts them out to pasture in a broad field (= exile).<br>

The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lvK</FONT> ("to stumble; to stagger; to totter") is used figuratively to describe distress (Isa 59:10; Ps 107:12), the debilitating effects of misfortune and calamity (Isa 5:27), and toil in exile (Lam 5:13). It is often used figuratively to describe the overthrow of a people/nation through divine judgment (Isa 8:15; Jer 6:21; 50:32; Hos 4:5; 5:5; 14:2). The Niphal stem, used here, is also frequently used in reference to divine judgment: "be overthrown," of nations, armies (Jer 6:15; 8:12; Dan 11:19, 33, 34, 41) (BDB 505.1b). This figurative use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lvK</FONT> ("to stumble") is often used in collocation with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lpn</FONT> ("to fall") (Isa 3:8; 31:3; 8:15; Jer 6:15; Dan 11:19).<br>

The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lvK</FONT> appeared in the preceding line (Niphal "be overthrown") and now appears here (Qal "will stumble"). The repetition of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lvK</FONT> emphasizes that a similar fate will befall Judah because it failed to learn its lesson from God's judgment on Israel. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lvK</FONT> ("to stumble") does not describe the moral stumbling of Judah, but the effect of God's judgment (Isa 8:15; Jer 6:21; 50:32; Hos 4:5; 5:5; 14:2), and the toil of exile (Lam 5:13).<br>

 <a name="fn193" href="hos.htm#fnB193"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:11)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qvu</FONT> ("to oppress") may refer to (1) oppressing the poor and defenseless (BDB 798.1), or more likely to (2) oppression of one nation by another as the judgment of God (Deut 28:29, 33; 1 Chr 16:21; Pss 105:14; 119:121, 122; Isa 52:4; Jer 50:33; Hos 5:11) (BDB 798.2). The Qal passive participles <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qWvu</FONT> ("oppressed") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">JWxr</FONT> ("crushed") might refer to a present situation (so KJV, RSV, NASB, NIV, NRSV); however, the context suggests that they refer to a future situation. When a participle is used in reference to the future, it often denotes an imminent future situation, and may be rendered, "about to" (e.g., Gen 6:17; 15:14; 20:3; 37:30; 41:25; 49:29; Exod 9:17-18; Deut 28:31; 1 Sam 3:11; 1 Kgs 2:2; 20:22; 2 Kgs 7:2).

The LXX reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kai to krima mou wJ" fw"</FONT> ("my judgment goes forth like light") which reflects <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">axy roaK yfpvmw</FONT> ("my judgment goes forth like the light") and posits only a simple misdivision of words. This is reflected in the Syriac Peshitta and Aramaic Targum. See D.

 <a name="fn221" href="hos.htm#fnB221"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:5)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">roa</FONT> ("light") is used here in reference to the morning light or dawn (e.g., Judg 16:2; 19:26; 1 Sam 14:36; 25:34, 36; 2 Sam 17:22; 23:4; 2 Kgs 7:9; Neh 8:3; Job 24:14; Prov 4:18; Mic 2:1) rather than lightning (cf. NIV). This continues the early morning imagery used throughout 6:2-5.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (6:5)  In 6:3 unrepentant Israel uttered an over-confident boast that the LORD would rescue the nation from calamity as certainly as the "light of the dawn" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rjv</FONT>) "comes forth" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">axy</FONT>) every morning. Playing upon the early morning imagery, the LORD responded in 6:4 that Israel's prerequisite repentance was as fleeting as the early morning dew. Now in 6:5, the LORD announces that He will indeed appear as certainly as the morning; however, it will not be to rescue but punish Israel: punishment will "come forth" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">axy</FONT>) like the "light of the dawn" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">roa</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn222" href="hos.htm#fnB222"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:6)  The phrase "I delight" does not appear in Hebrew text in this line, but is implied from the parallelism in the preceding line.<br>
 <a name="fn223" href="hos.htm#fnB223"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (6:6)  Contrary to popular misunderstanding, Hosea does not reject animal sacrifice nor cultic ritual, and advocate obedience only. Rather, God does not delight in ritual sacrifice <i>without</i> the accompanying prerequisite moral obedience (1 Sam 15:22; Pss 40:6-8; 51:16-17; Prov 21:3; Isa 1:11-17; Jer 7:21-23; Hos 6:6; Mic 6:6-8). However, if prerequisite moral obedience is present, he delights in sacrificial worship as an outward expression (Ps 51:19). Presented by a repentant obedient worshiper, whole burnt offerings were "an aroma pleasing" to the LORD (Lev 1:9, 13).<br>
 <a name="fn224" href="hos.htm#fnB224"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:7)  Or "Like Adam"; or "Like [sinful] men." The MT reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;daK</FONT> ("like Adam" or "as [sinful] men"); however, the editors of <i>BHS</i> suggest this reflects orthographic confusion of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;daB</FONT> ("at Adam"), as suggested by the locative adverb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v</FONT> ("there") in the following line. However, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v</FONT> sometimes functions in a non-locative sense similar to the deictic particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hNh</FONT> ("Behold!"). The singular noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;da</FONT> has been taken in several different ways: (1) proper name: "like Adam" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;daK</FONT>), (2) collective singular: "like [sinful] men" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;daK</FONT>), (3) proper location: "at Adam," referring to a city in the Jordan Valley (Josh 3:16), emending comparative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">K</FONT> to locative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B</FONT> ("at"): "at Adam" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;daB</FONT>). BDB suggests the collective sense, referring to sinful men (Num 5:6; 1 Kgs 8:46; 2 Chr 6:36; Jer 10:14; Job 31:33; Hos 6:7) (BDB 9.2). The English translations are divided: "like Adam" (NASB, NIV, KJV margin, RSV margin, TEV margin), "at Adam" (RSV, TEV, CEV), and "like men" (KJV).<br>
 <a name="fn225" href="hos.htm#fnB225"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:7)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rbu</FONT> refers here to breaking a covenant and carries the nuance "to overstep, transgress" (BDB 717.1.i).<br>
 <a name="fn226" href="hos.htm#fnB226"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:7)  The adverb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v</FONT> normally functions in a locative sense meaning "there" (BDB 1027). However, in poetry <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v</FONT> sometimes functions in a non-locative sense, to introduce expressions of astonishment or when a scene is vividly visualized in the writer's imagination or (see BDB 1027.1a<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">b</FONT>), somewhat similar to the deictic particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hNh</FONT> ("Behold!"): "See [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v</FONT>] how the evildoers lie fallen!" (Ps 36:13); "Listen! The cry on the day of the LORD will be bitter! See [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v</FONT>]! The shouting of the warrior!" (Zeph 1:14); "They saw [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">War</FONT>] her and were astonished... See [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v</FONT>] how trembling seized them!" (Ps 48:7). In some cases, it introduces emphatic statements in a manner similar to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hNh</FONT> ("Behold!"): "Come and see [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WarW Wkl</FONT>] what God has done...Behold [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v</FONT>], let us rejoice in him!" (Ps 66:6); "See/Behold [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v</FONT>]! I will make a horn grow for David" (Ps 132:17). The translation "Oh how!" in Hosea 6:7 is less visual than the Hebrew idiom <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v </FONT>("See! See how!"), but it more closely approximates the parallel English idiom of astonishment.<br>
 <a name="fn227" href="hos.htm#fnB227"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:7)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dgB</FONT> ("to act treacherously") is often used in reference to faithlessness in covenant relationships (BDB 93).<br>

This particular use of the participle is an ironic play on the professional occupation function (see <i>IBHS</i> 37.2). In effect, the major "professional guild" in Gilead is evildoing; the people are producers of evil!<br>

However, the <i>BHK</i> and <i>BHS</i> editors suggest that it belongs with the beginning of 7:1. The versions (Greek, Syriac, Latin) all reflect textual traditions that connect it with 6:11. The English translations are divided: (1) connect it with 6:11 (KJV, NASB); (2) connect it with 7:1 (RSV, NIV, NJPS, CEV, TEV). The parallelism between this line and 7:1a favors connecting it with 7:1.<br>

 <a name="fn234" href="hos.htm#fnB234"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tc</b> (7:4)  The MT reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ypanm</FONT> "adulterers" (Piel participle mpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[an</FONT>, "to commit adultery"), which does not seem to fit the context. The original reading was probably <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ypwa </FONT>"bakers" (Qal participle mpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hpa</FONT>, "to bake"), which harmonizes well with the baker/oven/fire motif in 7:4-7. The textual deviation was caused by: (1) confusion of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">n</FONT> (<i>nun</i>) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">w</FONT> (<i>vav</i>), (2) metathesis of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">n</FONT>/<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">w</FONT> (<i>nun/vav</i>) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">a</FONT> (<i>alef</i>), and (3) dittography of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">m</FONT> (<i>mem</i>) from the preceding word: original <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ypwa &lt;lk</FONT> ("all of them are bakers") was confused for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ypanm &lt;lk</FONT> ("all of them are adulterers"). In spite of this most English translations follow the MT's reading here.<br>
 <a name="fn235" href="hos.htm#fnB235"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tc </b> (7:4) The MT preserves the enigmatic <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">m hrub rwnt wmk</FONT> ("Like a burning oven, from...?"). The adjectival participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrub</FONT> ("burning") is feminine while the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rwnt</FONT> ("oven") that it modifies is masculine. The <i>BHS</i> editors solve this problem by simply redividing the words: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;h rub rwnt wmk</FONT> ("they are like a burning oven").<br>

 <a name="fn238" href="hos.htm#fnB238"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tc</b> (7:5)  The MT vocalizes the consonants <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wljh</FONT> as Hiphil perfect 3cpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlj</FONT> I "to become sick."

The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest revocalizing it as Hiphil infinitive construct + 3ms suffix from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">llj</FONT> "to begin" or Hiphil perfect 3cpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">llj</FONT> "to begin."

However, the Hebrew lexicographers suggest that both of these options are unlikely. Several other Hebrew MSS preserve an alternate textual tradition of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wddwgty</FONT> which is Hitpolel imperfect 3cpl "they slash themselves" from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ddG </FONT>"to cut" (BDB 151), as also reflected in the LXX. This reflects the pagan Canaanite cultic practice of priests cutting themselves and draining their blood on the ground to elicit agricultural fertility by resurrecting the slain fertility god Baal from the underworld (Deut 14:1; 1 Kgs 18:28; Jer 16:6; 41:5; 47:5).<br>

 <a name="fn270" href="hos.htm#fnB270"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:6)  The conjunction <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK</FONT> introduces a concessive clause: "Although, when, if, even if" (BDB 473.2.c.<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">b</FONT>).

The prophetic context of 9:7 favors the latter option.

The major options include: (1) Adopt the MT vocalization and <i>BHS</i> line division: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aybn</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yhla &lt;u &lt;yrpa hpx</FONT> "The prophet is a watchman over Ephraim with my God [= on behalf of God]." There are two problems with this: (a) Although <i>BHS</i> places <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aybn</FONT> ("prophet") with this colon, the Aleppo Codex and Leningrad Codex both connect <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aybn</FONT> ("prophet") with the next colon. (b) The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yhla &lt;u </FONT>"with my God" is difficult to explain. (2) Adopt the MT vocalization and the MT line division: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yhla &lt;u &lt;yrpa hpx </FONT>("Ephraim is a watchman with my God"). The problem with this, of course, is that Ephraim hardly fits the description of a prophetic watchman. (3) Revocalize the MT and adopt <i>BHS</i> line division: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aybn</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yhla &lt;u &lt;yrpa hpx </FONT>("Ephraim--the people of my God!--lies in ambush for the prophet." This involves: (a) revocalization of the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;u</FONT> ("with") to the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;u</FONT> ("people"), (b) taking <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yhla-&lt;u</FONT> ("people of my God") in apposition to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrpa</FONT> ("Ephraim"), and (c) nuancing <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hpx</FONT> as "to lie in wait (=set ambush)" (e.g., Ps 37:32). This is contextually attractive and harmonizes well with the following line: "traps are laid along all of his paths." However, it has two problems: (a) no textual evidence supporting the revocalization of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;u</FONT> as "people" and (b) the unusual nuance "to lie in wait" for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hpx</FONT> occurs only in Ps 37:32, where it takes the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l</FONT> (i.e., "to lie in wait for the righteous") (<i>HALOT</i> 3:1044.4). (4) Emend <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yhla</FONT> ("my God") to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lha</FONT> ("tent"), as suggested in the <i>BHS</i> textual apparatus: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aybn</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lha &lt;u &lt;yrpa hpx </FONT>("Ephraim spies on the prophet's tent"). The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hpx</FONT> may mean "to spy" (BDB 859; <i>HALOT</i> 3:1044.3); however, the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;u</FONT> does not normally mean "upon" and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hpx</FONT> is not used with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;u</FONT> elsewhere.<br>

 <a name="fn288" href="hos.htm#fnB288"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tc</b> (9:8)  Or "The prophet is like a trap along all of his paths." The Aleppo Codex and Leningrad Codex (MS used in <i>BHS</i>) both connect <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aybn</FONT> ("prophet") with this colon. On the other hand, <i>BHS</i> places <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aybn</FONT> ("prophet") at the end of the preceding colon.<br>
 <a name="fn289" href="hos.htm#fnB289"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:8)  <i>Heb</i> "house." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tyb</FONT> ("house") is used as a figure of speech, referring to either (1) the temple or official sanctuaries or (2) the land of Israel (e.g., Hos 9:15).<br>
 <a name="fn290" href="hos.htm#fnB290"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:9)  More literally, "they are deeply corrupted." The two verbs <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wtjv-Wqymuh</FONT> (literally, "they have made deep, they act corruptly") are coordinated without a conjunction <i>vav</i> to form a verbal hendiadys: the second verb represents the main idea, while the first functions adverbially (GKC &#167;120.<i>g</i>). Here Gesenius suggests: "they are deeply/radically corrupted." Several translations mirror the syntax of this hendiadys: "They have deeply corrupted themselves" (KJV, RSV), "they have been grievously corrupt" (NJPS), and "they are hopelessly evil" (TEV). Others reverse the syntax for the sake of a more graphic English idiom: "they have gone deep in depravity" (NASB) and "they have sunk deep into corruption" (NIV). Some translations fail to represent the hendiadys at all: "You are brutal and corrupt" (CEV). The translation "they are deeply corrupted" mirrors the Hebrew syntax, but "they have sunk deep into corruption" is a more graphic English idiom.<br>
 <a name="fn291" href="hos.htm#fnB291"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:10)  <i>Heb</i> "fathers."<br>

 <a name="fn293" href="hos.htm#fnB293"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:11)  <i>Heb</i> "no childbearing, no pregnancy, no conception." The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m</FONT> prefixed to the three parallel nouns functions in a privative sense, indicating deprivation (BDB 583.7).<br>
 <a name="fn294" href="hos.htm#fnB294"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:12)  <i>Heb</i> "I will bereave them from a man."<br>
 <a name="fn295" href="hos.htm#fnB295"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tc </b> (9:13) The MT is corrupt in 9:13. The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest emending the text to follow the LXX reading. See D. Barthelemy, <i>Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i> (New York: United Bible Societies, 1980), 250-51.<br>
 <a name="fn296" href="hos.htm#fnB296"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:14)  <i>Heb</i> "breasts that shrivel up dry."<br>

 <a name="fn299" href="hos.htm#fnB299"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:1)  The phrase "to Baal" does not appear in the Hebrew text here, but is implied; it is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn300" href="hos.htm#fnB300"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:2)  <i>Heb</i> "he"; the referent (the LORD) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn301" href="hos.htm#fnB301"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tc</b> (10:4)  The referent of the 3cpl verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WrBD</FONT> ("they utter") is the ms noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ElMhw</FONT> ("a king" in v. 3) which is used generically, representing all human kings of Israel to which the 3cpl verb refers. Although this is a bit syntactically awkward, it is not necessary to emend the MT to the 3ms verb form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rbD</FONT> ("he utters") as the <i>BHS</i> editors suggest. The LXX , however, reads the singular form <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">lalwn</FONT> ("uttering").<br>
 <a name="fn302" href="hos.htm#fnB302"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:4)  <i>Heb</i> "they speak words." The cognate accusative construction <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrbd WrBD</FONT> (literally, "they speak words") is an idiom that means "they speak mere words" or "they utter empty words," that is, they make empty promises (e.g., Isa 58:13) (BDB 181.2). The immediately following collocated phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">awv twla</FONT> ("swearing an empty oath") confirms this nuance. The LXX understood this idiom in the same way: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">lalwn rJhmata proqaseia" yeudei"</FONT> ("speaking false professions as his words").<br>
 <a name="fn303" href="hos.htm#fnB303"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:4)  The two infinitive absolutes <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tola</FONT> (Qal infinitive absolute from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hla</FONT> II "to swear an oath" BDB 46) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">trK</FONT> (Qal infinitive absolute from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">trk</FONT> "to make [a covenant]" BDB 503.4), which appear without conjunctions, continue the description of the action of the preceding finite verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WrBD</FONT> (Piel perfect 3cpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rbD</FONT> "to speak"). Although the infinitives continue the description of the action of the finite verb, they call special attention to the action of the infinitive rather than the action of the finite verb. See <i>IBHS</i> 35.5.2.b.<br>
 <a name="fn304" href="hos.htm#fnB304"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:4)  The word "empty" is not in the Hebrew text, but is implied. It is supplied in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn305" href="hos.htm#fnB305"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:4)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">var</FONT> II refers to a "poisonous plant" (Deut 29:17; Hos 10:4) or "bitter herb" (Ps 69:22; Lam 3:5) (BDB 912.1; <i>HALOT</i> 3:1167.1).<br>
 <a name="fn306" href="hos.htm#fnB306"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tc </b> (10:5) The MT reads the singular construct noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/kv</FONT> "the inhabitant [of Samaria]," while the LXX and Syriac reflect the plural construct noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ynkv</FONT> "the inhabitants [of Samaria]." The singular noun may be a collective referring to the population of Samaria as a whole (BDB 1015) (e.g., Isa 33:24). Most English translations view this as a reference to the inhabitants of the city as a whole (KJV, RSV, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NJPS, TEV, CEV).<br>
 <a name="fn307" href="hos.htm#fnB307"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tc </b> (10:5) The MT reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WrWgy</FONT> (Qal imperfect 3cpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rWg</FONT> III "to dread" BDB 159.1). This is syntactically awkward because <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rWg</FONT> III ("to dread") is used nowhere else with the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l </FONT>("they are in dread for..."?). BDB suggests reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WdWny</FONT> (Qal imperfect 3cpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dWn</FONT> "to lament" BDB 626.2.a) which harmonizes better with the parallelism with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lba</FONT> ("to mourn") in the following line. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dWn</FONT> ("to lament") is used with the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l</FONT> in the idiom "to lament for" (e.g., Isa 51:19; Jer 15:5; 16:5; 48:17; Nah 3:7). This involves simple orthographic confusion between <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">g</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">n</FONT>, as well as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">r</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">d</FONT> which were often confused by the scribes.<br>
 <a name="fn308" href="hos.htm#fnB308"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tc </b> (10:5) The MT reads the plural <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tolgul</FONT> "for the calves," while some Greek versions (LXX, Theodotion) and the Syriac reflect the singular <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lgul</FONT> "for the calf [calf idol]." The singular reading is preferred on the basis of internal evidence: the oracle denounces the calf idol worship of Samaria. The plural form probably arose due to the ambiguity of the term "calf" when a scribe did not realize that the term was being used as a metonymy for the worship of the Egyptian calf goddess. Most English translations adopt the singular form and relate it to the calf goddess cult (RSV, NASB, NIV, NJPS, TEV, CEV); however, older translations follow the MT plural (KJV).<br>
 <a name="fn309" href="hos.htm#fnB309"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:5)  See the note on the place name <i>Beth-Aven</i> in 4:15.<br>
 <a name="fn310" href="hos.htm#fnB310"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tc </b> (10:5) The MT appears to read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wlygy</FONT> "they will rejoice" (Qal imperfect 3mpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lyg</FONT> "to rejoice"), but this is likely an example of semantic polarization. See Andersen and Freedman, <i>Hosea</i>, 556-67. The <i>BHS</i> editors propose the reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wlylyy</FONT> "they will lament" (Hiphil imperfect 3mpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lly</FONT> "to lament"), which also appears in Hos 7:14. If this reading is original, the textual variant may be attributed to: (1) orthographic confusion between <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">g</FONT>, and (2) haplography (letter written once which should have been written twice) or dittography (letter written twice that should have been written once) of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">y</FONT> (<i>yod</i>). English translations are split; some follow the MT (KJV, NIV, NJPS, CEV), others emend (RSV, NASB, TEV).<br>
 <a name="fn311" href="hos.htm#fnB311"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tc</b> (10:5)  This line division follows the MT rather than the line division suggested by the <i>BHS</i> editors.<br>
 <a name="fn312" href="hos.htm#fnB312"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:5)  <i>Heb</i> "from it."<br>
 <a name="fn313" href="hos.htm#fnB313"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:6)  The antecedent of the 3ms direct object pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">otoa</FONT> ("it") is probably the calf idol of Beth-Aven mentioned in 10:5a. This has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn314" href="hos.htm#fnB314"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tc</b> (10:6)  The MT reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bry Elm</FONT> ("a king who contends"?) which is syntactically awkward: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Elm</FONT> "king" followed by <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bry</FONT> "let him contend!" (Qal jussive 3ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">byr</FONT> "to contend"). The MT is probably guilty of faulty word division. As the <i>BHS</i> editors suggest, the original reading is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">br yklm</FONT> ("the great king"). The suffixed <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">y</FONT> (<i>yod</i>) on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yklm</FONT> is the remnant of the old genitive ending. This is the equivalent of the Assyrian royal epithet <i>sarru rabbu</i> ("the great king").<br>
 <a name="fn315" href="hos.htm#fnB315"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn </b> (10:6) The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m</FONT> functions in a causal sense (logical cause): "because of" or "on account of" (e.g., Exod 2:23; Deut 7:7; Nah 3:4) (see BDB 580.2.f; <i>HALOT</i> 2:598.6).<br>
 <a name="fn316" href="hos.htm#fnB316"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:6)  The meaning of the root of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">otxum</FONT> (preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m</FONT> + fs noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hxu</FONT> + 3ms suffix) is debated. There are three options: (1) "its counsel" from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hxu</FONT> I "counsel; advice; plan" (BDB 420; <i>HALOT</i> 2:867.3.a); (2) "its disobedience" from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hxu</FONT> II "disobedience" (however, the existence of this root is debated) (<i>HALOT</i> 2:867); and (3) "its wooden idol" from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hxu</FONT> III "wood" (Jer 6:6) referring to the wooden idol/effigy (calf idol in 10:5), a stick of wood covered with gold (<i>HALOT</i> 3:867). The last option is favored contextually: (a) the idol is called "a stick of wood" in Hosea 4:12, and (b) the calf idol (probably the referent) of the cult is mentioned in 10:5. The translations are split: (1) "his idol" (RSV, NRSV), "its wooden idols" (NIV), "image" (NJPS margin), "that idol" (CEV); and (2) "his own counsel" (KJV), "its own counsel" (NASB), "his plans" (NJPS), "advice" (TEV).<br>
 <a name="fn317" href="hos.htm#fnB317"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:7)  The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmdn</FONT> (Niphal participle fs) is derived from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmd</FONT> II (BDB)//III (<i>HALOT</i>) "be cut off, cease to exist, be destroyed" (BDB 198; <i>HALOT</i> 1:225). The Niphal form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmdn</FONT> "will be destroyed" is paralleled by the Niphal <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wdmvnw</FONT> "will be destroyed" in 10:8. Several translations nuance the literal wording for the sake of the idiom: "will float away like a twig on the surface of water" (NIV), "like a twig in a stream...will be swept away" (CEV), "will be carried off like a chip of wood on water" (TEV).<br>
 <a name="fn318" href="hos.htm#fnB318"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:7)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[xq</FONT> II is a <i>hapax legomenon</i> (a term that occurs only once). Historically, it has been understood in two different ways: (1) "foam" (Vulgate, Aquila, Symmachus) and (2) "snapped-off twig" (LXX, Theodotion, Syriac Peshitta). Both interpretations make sense in the light of the simile. The latter has more support because of the related verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[xq</FONT> "to cut off, chop off" used in reference to wood (BDB 893; <i>HALOT</i> 3:1125) and the related feminine noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hpxq</FONT> "stump; splinter" of fig-tree (BDB 893; <i>HALOT</i> 3:1125). Translations differ along these lines: (1) "foam" (KJV, NJPS) and (2) "chip" (RSV, TEV), "stick" (NASB), "twig" (NIV, CEV).<br>
 <a name="fn319" href="hos.htm#fnB319"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:8)  Alternately, "Aven" for the city name "Beth-Aven." The term "Beth" (= house) does not appear in the Hebrew text here, but is implied (e.g., Hos 4:15). It is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn320" href="hos.htm#fnB320"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tc </b> (10:8) The MT reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/wa tomb</FONT> ("high-places of Aven"); however, several Hebrew MSS read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/wa-tb tomb</FONT> ("high-places of Beth-Aven"). In Hosea 4:15 the name <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/wa-tb</FONT> "Beth-Aven" (<i>Heb</i> "house of wickedness") is a wordplay on "Bethel" (<i>Heb</i> "house of God"). It is possible that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/wa-tb tomb</FONT> ("high-places of Beth-Aven") was original: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tb</FONT> ("house") dropped out as an unintentional scribal error by haplography (letters written once that should have been written twice) due to presence of the consonants <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tb</FONT> in the preceding word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twmb</FONT> ("high-places").<br>
 <b>tn</b> (10:8)  <i>Heb</i> "high places of wickedness" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/wa tomb</FONT>). The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/wa</FONT> ("wickedness") is an attributive genitive: "wicked high places."<br>

 <a name="fn322" href="hos.htm#fnB322"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:10)  <i>Heb</i> "in my desire."<br>
 <a name="fn323" href="hos.htm#fnB323"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tc</b> (10:10)  The MT reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;rSaw</FONT> (<i>vav</i> conjunction + Niphal imperfect 1cs + 3mpl suffix from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rsa</FONT> "to bind"). The LXX reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">paideusai aujtou"</FONT> ("to discipline them") which reflects a <i>Vorlage</i> of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;rSya</FONT> (Qal imperfect 1cs + 3mpl suffix from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rsy</FONT> "to discipline" BDB 416.3). The textual variant was caused by orthographic confusion between <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">w</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">y</FONT> with metathesis of the two letters.<br>
 <a name="fn324" href="hos.htm#fnB324"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:10)  <i>Heb</i> "Nations will be gathered together against them."<br>
 <a name="fn325" href="hos.htm#fnB325"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:10)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rsa</FONT> ("to bind") often refers to conquered peoples being bound as prisoners (BDB 63). Here it is used figuratively to describe the Israelites being taken into exile.<br>
 <a name="fn326" href="hos.htm#fnB326"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tc</b> (10:10)  The Kethib is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;tnyu ytvl</FONT> ("for their two eyes"), while the Qere reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;tnou ytvl</FONT> ("for their two sins"). The phrase "two sins" could refer to (1) the sinful episode at Gibeah and the subsequent war between the tribe of Benjamin and the other tribes (Judges 19-21), or (2) the entire Gibeah incident (Judges 19-21) and Israel's subsequent failure to repent up to the time of Hosea: "the time of Gibeah" (= first sin) and "there you have remained" (= second sin).<br>
 <a name="fn327" href="hos.htm#fnB327"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tc</b> (10:11)  The MT is unintelligible: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWf-lu^</FONT> ("upon a fine [thing]"?). The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest the revocalization <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWf-lu)</FONT> ("a fine yoke"). The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu</FONT> ("yoke") also appears in 11:4 in a metaphor which also compares Israel to a young heifer.<br>

The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest the original reading was <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;Bkrb</FONT> ("in your chariots"). If this is correct, the textual corruption was caused by orthographic confusion between <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bKr</FONT> ("chariot") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">krD</FONT> ("way").<br>
 <a name="fn332" href="hos.htm#fnB332"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:13)  The phrase "you have relied" does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the parallelism in the preceding line. <br>

The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm)d+n]</FONT> (Niphal infinitive absolute) appears in the first colon, and the form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*d+n]</FONT> (Niphal perfect 3ms) appears in the second colon. This striking repetition creates a dramatic wordplay: "The moment the dawn <i>ceases to exist</i> (= at the break of dawn), the king of Israel will <i>cease to exist</i>."<br>

The textual variant was caused simply by faulty word division.<br>
 <a name="fn340" href="hos.htm#fnB340"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:3)  Or "taught Ephraim to walk." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yTlGrt</FONT> "I taught [him] to walk, I led [him]" (Tiphil perfect 1cs from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lgr</FONT> "to walk") is an unusual verb stem: the Tiphil (properly Taphel) is attested three times in Biblical Hebrew (Hos 11:3; Jer 12:5; 22:15) and once in Biblical Aramaic (Ezra 4:7) (see GKC &#167;55.<i>h</i>).<br>

The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;da</FONT> is traditionally related to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;da</FONT> I ("man") and translated either literally or figuratively (metonymy of association: humane compassion): "cords of a man" (KJV, RSV margin, NASB), "cords of human kindness" (NIV), "human ties" (NJPS), "cords of compassion" (RSV). It is better to relate it to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;da</FONT> II "leather" (<i>HALOT</i> 1:14), as the parallelism with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbha</FONT> II ("leather") suggests (see below). This homonymic root is well attested in Arabic <i>&#180;adam</i> ("skin") and <i>&#180;adim</i> ("tanned skin; leather"). This better fits the context of 11:4 which compares Israel to a heifer: the LORD led him with leather cords, lifted the yoke from his neck, and fed him. Elsewhere, Hosea compares Israel to a stubborn cow (4:6) and harnessed heifer (10:11). <br>
 <a name="fn343" href="hos.htm#fnB343"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:4)  Or "ropes of love." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbha</FONT> is traditionally related to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbha</FONT> I "love" (BDB 13.2). This approach is adopted by most English translations: "bands of love" (KJV, RSV), "bonds of love" (NASB), "ties of love" (NIV), "cords of love" (NJPS). However, it is probably better to derive <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbha</FONT> from the homonymic root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbha</FONT> II "leather" (<i>HALOT</i> 1:18). This root is attested in Arabic and Ugaritic. It probably occurs in the description of Solomon's sedan chair: "upholstered with purple linen, and lined with leather" (Song 3:10). This fits the context of 11:4 which compares Israel to a young heifer: the LORD led him with leather ropes, lifted the yoke from his neck, and bent down to feed him. Elsewhere, Hosea compares Israel to a stubborn cow (4:6) and a young heifer harnessed for plowing (10:11). This is supported by the parallelism with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;da</FONT> II "leather" (<i>HALOT</i> 1:14). Of course, this might be an example of a homonymic wordplay on both roots: "ropes of leather / love." For discussions of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbha</FONT> II, see G. R.

 <a name="fn347" href="hos.htm#fnB347"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tc</b> (11:5)  Or "Will they not return to Egypt?" Following the LXX and <i>BHS</i>, the MT <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">al</FONT> ("not") should probably be read as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ol</FONT> ("to him") and connected to the end of 11:4 rather than the beginning of 11:5. The textual confusion between <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">al</FONT> ("not") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ol</FONT> ("to him") probably reflects an unintentional scribal error due to a mistake in hearing (e.g., Kethib/Qere in Ps 100:3).<br>

The root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv</FONT> ("to turn, return") appears at the beginning and ending of this verse, creating an <i>inclusio</i>. This repetition produces an ironic wordplay: because Israel refuses to "return" to God or "turn" from its sin, it will "return" to Egypt. The punishment fits the crime.<br>
 <a name="fn350" href="hos.htm#fnB350"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:7)  The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yaWlt</FONT> (Qal passive participle mpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">alT</FONT> "to hang") literally means "[My people] are hung up" (BDB 1067). The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">alT</FONT> // <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlT </FONT>("to hang") is often used in a concrete sense to describe hanging an item on a peg (Ps 137:2; Song 4:4; Isa 22:24; Ezek 15:3; 27:10) or the impaling of the body of an executed criminal (Gen 40:19, 22; 41:13; Deut 21:22, 23; Josh 8:29; 10:26; 2 Sam 21:12; Esth 2:23; 5:14; 6:4; 7:9, 10; 8:7; 9:13, 14, 25). It is used figuratively here to describe Israel's moral inability to detach itself from apostasy. Several English translations capture the sense well: "My people are bent on turning away from me" (RSV, NASB), "My people are determined to turn from me" (NIV), "My people are determined to reject me" (CEV), "My people persist in its defection from me" (NJPS), and "they insist on turning away from me" (TEV).<br>

 <a name="fn352" href="hos.htm#fnB352"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tc </b> (11:7) The meaning and syntax of the MT is enigmatic: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wh arqy lu-law</FONT> ("they call upwards to him"). The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aWhw arqy luB-law</FONT> ("they call to Baal, but he..."), connecting the 3ms independent personal pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aWhw</FONT> ("but he...") with the following clause. The early Greek recensions (Aquila and Symmachus), as well as the Aramaic Targum and the Vulgate, vocalized <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu)</FONT> as "yoke" (as in 11:4): "they cry out because of [their] yoke" (adopted by TEV).<br>
 <a name="fn353" href="hos.htm#fnB353"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:8)  The imperfect verbs in 11:8 function as imperfects of capability. See <i>IBHS</i> 34.1.a.<br>
 <a name="fn354" href="hos.htm#fnB354"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:8)  The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yBl ylu EPhn</FONT> is an idiom that can be taken in two ways: (1) emotional sense: to describe a tumult of emotions, not just a clash of ideas, that are afflicting a person (Lam 1:20) (<i>HALOT</i> 1:253.1c) and (2) volitional sense: to describe a decisive change of policy, that is, a reversal of sentiment from amity to hatred (Exod 14:5; Ps 105:25) (BDB 245.1; <i>HALOT</i> 1:253.3). The English translations alternate between these two: (1) emotional discomfort and tension over the prospect of destroying Israel: "my heart is turned within me" (KJV), "my heart recoils within me" (RSV), "my heart is turned over within me" (NASB); and (2) volitional reversal of previous decision to totally destroy Israel: "I have had a change of heart" (NJPS), "my heart is changed within me" (NIV), and "my heart will not let me do it!" (TEV). The lexicons suggest that the idiom describes a decisive change of heart (reversal of decision to totally destroy Israel once and for all) rather than emotional turbulence of God shifting back and forth between whether to destroy or spare Israel (BDB 245.1b; <i>HALOT</i> 1:253.3). This volitional nuance is supported by the modal function of the 1cs imperfects in 11:8 ("I will not carry out My fierce anger...I will not destroy Ephraim...I will not come in wrath") and by the prophetic announcement of future restoration in 11:10-11. Clearly, a dramatic reversal both in tone and in divine intention occurs between 11:5-11.<br>
 <a name="fn355" href="hos.htm#fnB355"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:8)  The Niphal of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rmK</FONT> means "to grow warm, tender" (BDB 485), as its use in a simile with the oven demonstrates (Lam 5:10). It is used several times to describe the arousal of the most tender affection (Gen 43:30; 1 Kgs 3:26; Hos 11:8) (BDB 485.1; <i>HALOT</i> 2:482.1).<br>
 <a name="fn356" href="hos.htm#fnB356"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:9)  The three imperfect verbs function as imperfects of capability, similar to the imperfects of capability in 11:8. See <i>IBHS</i> 34.1.a.<br>
 <a name="fn357" href="hos.htm#fnB357"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:10)  When the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">drj</FONT> ("to tremble") is used with prepositions of direction, it denotes "to go or come trembling" (BDB 353.4) (e.g., Gen 42:28; 1 Sam 13:7; 16:4; 21:2; Hos 11:10, 11). Thus, the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;Ym Wdrjyw</FONT> means "to come trembling from the west."<br>

 <a name="fn360" href="hos.htm#fnB360"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:1)  The phrase "has surrounded me" does not appear in the Hebrew text here, but is implied by the parallelism in the preceding line. It is supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons, smoothness and readability.<br>
 <a name="fn361" href="hos.htm#fnB361"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:1)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dWr</FONT> ("to roam about freely") is used in a concrete sense to refer to someone wandering restlessly and roaming back and forth (BDB 923) (Judg 11:37). Here, it is used figuratively, possibly with positive connotations, as indicated by the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;u</FONT> ("with"), to indicate accompaniment: "but Judah still goes about with God" (<i>HALOT</i> 3:1194). Some English translations render it positively: "Judah still walks with God" (RSV); "Judah is restive under God" (REB); "but Judah stands firm with God" (NJPS); "but Judah remains faithful" (CEV); "but Judah yet ruleth with God" (KJV). Others adopt the negative connotation "to wander restlessly" and nuance <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;u</FONT> in an adversative sense ("against"): "Judah is unruly against God" (NIV) and "the people of Judah are still rebelling against me" (TEV).<br>
 <a name="fn362" href="hos.htm#fnB362"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn </b> (12:1) <i>Heb</i> "a treaty."<br>

 <a name="fn364" href="hos.htm#fnB364"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn </b> (12:2) The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">byr</FONT> ("dispute") is used in two contexts: (1) <i>non-legal contexts</i>: (a) "dispute" between individuals (e.g., Gen 13:7; Isa 58:1; Jer 15:10) or (b) "brawl, quarrel" between people (e.g., Exod 17:7; Deut 25:1); and (2) <i>legal contexts</i>: (a) "lawsuit, legal process" (e.g., (Exod 23:3-6; Deut 19:17; 21:5; Ezek 44:24; Ps 35:23), (b) "lawsuit, legal case" (e.g., Deut 1:12; 17:8; Prov 18:17; 25:9), and (c) God's "lawsuit" on behalf of a person or against His own people (Hos 4:1; 12:3; Mic 6:2) (<i>HALOT</i> 3:1225-26). The term in Hosea refers to a covenant lawsuit in which Yahweh the suzerain lodges a legal case against his disobedient vassal, accusing Israel and Judah of breach of covenant which will elicit the covenant curses.<br>
 <a name="fn365" href="hos.htm#fnB365"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:3)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrc</FONT> means "to strive, contend" (<i>HALOT</i> 3:1354) or "to persevere, persist" (BDB 975) with (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;u</FONT>) God (see Gen 32:29; Hos 12:4) (<i>HALOT</i> 3:1354).<br>

 <a name="fn367" href="hos.htm#fnB367"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:4)  <i>Heb</i> "him"; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn368" href="hos.htm#fnB368"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tc </b> (12:4) The Leningrad Codex and the Allepo Codex both read 1cpl <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wn&lt;u</FONT> ("with us"). The LXX and Peshitta both reflect an alternate Hebrew <i>Vorlage</i> of 3ms <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">o&lt;u </FONT>("with him"). The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest emending the MT in favor of the Greek and Syriac. The internal evidence of 12:4-5 favors the 3ms reading. It is likely that the 1cpl <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wn-</FONT> reading on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wn&lt;u</FONT> arose due to a misunderstanding of the 3ms <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wn-</FONT> suffix on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wnaxmy</FONT> "he found him" (Qal imperfect 3ms + 3ms suffix) which was probably misunderstood as the 1cpl suffix: "he found us." Several translations follow the LXX and Syriac: "there he spoke with him" (RSV, NEB, NIV, NJPS, TEV). Others follow the MT: "there he spoke with us" (KJV, NASB, CEV). The Hebrew University Old Testament Project, which tends to preserve the MT whenever possible, adopts the MT reading but gives it only a "C" rating: see D.

 <a name="fn370" href="hos.htm#fnB370"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:6)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWvt</FONT> (Qal imperfect 2ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv</FONT> "to return") functions as an imperfect of moral obligation, introducing the following imperatives (e.g., Gen 20:9; Exod 4:15). For this function of the imperfect, see <i>IBHS</i> 31.4.g.<br>
 <a name="fn371" href="hos.htm#fnB371"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:6)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hWqw</FONT> (<i>vav</i> + Piel imperative 2ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwq</FONT> "to wait for") means "to hope for, wait for, look eagerly for" (BDB 875.1; <i>HALOT</i> 3:1082.2.b). The Qal meaning refers to a general hope; the Piel meaning refers to hope directed towards a target, or hope inserted within a sequence of expectation and fulfillment. When the Piel is used in reference to a thing, it refers to waiting expectantly for something to occur (e.g., Gen 49:18; Isa 5:2, 4, 7; 59:9, 11; Jer 8:15; 13:16; 14:19; Ps 69:21; Job 3:9; 6:19; 11:20). When it is used in reference to God, it refers to the people of God waiting expectantly for God to do something or to fulfill His promise (e.g., Pss 25:5, 21; 27:14; 37:34; 40:2; 52:11; 130:5; Isa 8:17; 25:9; 26:8; 33:2; 51:5; 60:9; Hos 12:7). The personal object can be introduced by the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l</FONT> "for" (<i>HALOT</i> 3:1082.2.a) or <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la</FONT> "for" (<i>HALOT</i> 3:1082.2.b) (e.g., Pss 27:14<sup>2</sup>; 37:34; Isa 51:5; Hos 12:7). The point seems to be that if Israel will repent and practice moral righteousness, it can look to God in confident expectation that He will intervene on her behalf by relenting from judgment and restoring the covenant blessings.<br>
 <a name="fn372" href="hos.htm#fnB372"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn </b> (12:6) The phrase "to return to you" does not appear in the Hebrew text but is implied; it is provided in the translation for clarification.

 <a name="fn373" href="hos.htm#fnB373"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:7)  <i>Heb</i> "the merchant loves to cheat." The Hebrew has singular forms (noun and verb) which are used generically to refer to all Israelite merchants and traders in general. The singular noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/unK</FONT> II "a merchant; a trader" (BDB 488) is used in a generic sense to refer to the merchant class of Israel as a whole (e.g., Ezek 16:29; 17:4; Zeph 1:11).<br>
 <a name="fn374" href="hos.htm#fnB374"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:7)  <i>Heb</i> "The merchant--in his hand are scales of deceit--loves to defraud." The present translation redivides the Hebrew line division to produce a smoother English rendering.<br>

 <a name="fn376" href="hos.htm#fnB376"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:8)  <i>Heb</i> "I have found wealth for myself." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">axm</FONT> ("to find") is repeated in 12:8 to create a wordplay. The Israelites have "found" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">axm</FONT>) wealth for themselves (= become wealthy) (v. 8a) through dishonest business practices (v. 7). Nevertheless, they claim that no guilt can be "found" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">axm</FONT>) in anything they have done in gaining their wealth (v. 8b).<br>
 <a name="fn377" href="hos.htm#fnB377"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tc</b> (12:8)  The MT reads the 1cs suffix on the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yuygy</FONT> "my labors/gains" (mpl noun + 1cs suffix). The LXX's <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oiJ ponoi aujtou</FONT> ("his labors") assumes a 3ms suffix on the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wyuygy</FONT> "his labors/gains" (mpl noun + 3ms suffix). The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest adopting the LXX reading. The textual decision is based upon whether or not this line continues the speech of Ephraim (favors 1cs suffix) or whether these are the words of the prophet (favors 3ms suffix). See the following translator's note for explanation of the two rival textual options for the line as a whole.<br>
 <b>tn</b> (12:8)  <i>Heb</i> "In all my gains/labors" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yuygy</FONT>). The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">uygy</FONT> has a two-fold range of meanings: (1) "toil, labor" and (2) metonymical result of toil: "product, produce, gain, acquired property" (= wealth gained by labor) (BDB 388; <i>HALOT</i> 1:385-86). Normally, only one of the categories of meaning is present in any usage; however, it is possible that intentional semantic ambiguity is present in this usage because the context invokes both ideas: action + wealth.<br>
 <a name="fn378" href="hos.htm#fnB378"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:8)  The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yl /oa ytaxm</FONT> ("I have found wealth for myself" = I have become wealthy) forms a wordplay with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ou yl Waxm al</FONT> ("they will not find guilt in me"). The repetition of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yl axm</FONT> is enhanced by the paronomasia between the similar sounding nouns <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ou</FONT> ("guilt") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/oa</FONT> ("wealth"). The wordplay emphasizes that Israel's acquisition of wealth cannot be divorced from his guilt in dishonest business practices. Israel has difficulty in protesting his innocence that he is not guilty (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ou</FONT>) of the dishonest acquisition of wealth (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/wa</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn379" href="hos.htm#fnB379"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tc</b> (12:8)  The MT reads: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">afj-rva /ou yl-waxmy al yuygy-lK</FONT> ("[in] all my gains, they will not find guilt in me which would be sin"). The LXX reflects <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">afj-rva /oul ol-oaxmy al Wyuygy-lk</FONT> ("in all his labors, he cannot offset his guilt which is sin"). Some translations follow the LXX: "but all his riches can never offset the guilt he has incurred" (RSV), "None of his gains shall atone for the guilt of his sins" (NEB).

It also appears in Mishnaic Hebrew, meaning "trembling" (Dalman, AW 409b).

The English translations are split: (1) "they sin more and more" (KJV, RSV, NASB, NIV) and (2) "they go on sinning" (NJPS), "they continue to sin" (CEV), "they still keep on sinning" (TEV).<br>

It refers to a builder skillfully constructing a house (Prov 24:3), God skillfully fashioning creation (Ps 136:5; Prov 3:19) and a craftsman skillfully making an idol (Hos 13:2).<br>

Another possible rendering for the line is: "It is said of them--those men who sacrifice, "They kiss calves!"

 <a name="fn405" href="hos.htm#fnB405"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:2)  <i>Heb</i> "Those among men who offer sacrifices." The genitive-construct <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;da</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yjbz </FONT>("the sacrificers of men") is misunderstood by NIV as an objective genitive phrase: "they offer human sacrifice." Such a classification is questionable: (1) Nowhere else in the book does Hosea accuse Israel of human sacrifice, and (2) archaeological evidence does not provide any evidence of human sacrifice in the Northern Kingdom during Iron Age I (1200-722 B.C.). This phrase should be classified as a genitive of species: the genitive represents the whole class or kind of a species (= men) and the construct represents a part of the whole or subspecies within the whole (= those who sacrifice): "those among men who offer sacrifice" (= those who offer sacrifices). The expression "a fool of men" in Prov 15:20 provides a similar example: the genitive represents the whole class/species (= men) and the construct represents a part of the whole/subspecies (= a fool): "a foolish man." This is the tactic adopted by most English translations: "the men that sacrifice" (KJV), "the men who sacrifice" (NASB), "they appoint men to sacrifice [to them]" (NJPS).<br>

The Hebrew poets and prophets refer to morning clouds as a simile for transitoriness (Job 7:9; Isa 44:22; Hos 6:4; 13:3) (<i>HALOT</i> 2:858.1b; BDB 778.c).<br>

 <a name="fn410" href="hos.htm#fnB410"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:3)  <i>Heb</i> "storm-driven away." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rus</FONT> (Poel imperfect 3ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rus</FONT> "to storm") often refers to the intense action of strong, raging storm winds (e.g., Jon 1:11, 13). The related nouns refer to "heavy gale," "storm wind," and "high wind" (BDB 704; <i>HALOT</i> 2:762). The verb is used figuratively to describe the intensity of God's destruction of the wicked whom He will "blow away" (Isa 54:11; Hos 13:3; Hab 3:14; Zech 7:14) (BDB 704; <i>HALOT</i> 2:762).<br>

The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tobalT</FONT> occurs in the OT only here. It probably means "drought" (BDB 520). The related Arabic verb means "to be thirsty" and the related Arabic noun means "a stony tract of land." The plural form (singular = <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbalT</FONT>) is a plural of intensity: "a [land] of intense drought." The term functions as an attributive genitive, modifying the construct <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jra </FONT>("land"). The phrase is variously rendered: "land of drought" (KJV, RSV, NASB), "thirsty land" (NJPS), "thirsty desert" (CEV), "dry, desert land" (TEV), and the metonymical (effect for cause) "land of burning heat" (NIV).<br>

Some translations follow the MT: "according to their pasture" (KJV), "as they had their pasture" (NASB), "when you entered the good land" (TEV). Others adopt the first emendation: "when I fed them" (NIV), "I feed you [<i>sic</i> = them]" (CEV).

The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;ytjv</FONT> "I will destroy you" (Piel perfect 1cs + 2ms suffix").

 <a name="fn418" href="hos.htm#fnB418"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tc</b> (13:9)  The MT reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;rzub yb-yK</FONT> ("but in me is your help"). The LXX and Syriac reflect <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;rzub ym-yK</FONT> ("For who will help you?"). The interrogative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ym</FONT> ("Who?") harmonizes well with the interrogatives in 13:9-10 and should be adopted, as the <i>BHS</i> editors suggest. <br>
 <a name="fn419" href="hos.htm#fnB419"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tc </b> (13:10) The MT reads the enigmatic <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yha</FONT> "I want to be [your king]" (apocopated Qal imperfect 1cs from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hyh</FONT> "to be") which makes little sense and conflicts with the 3ms form in the dependent clause: "that he might save you" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;uyvoyw</FONT>). All the versions (Greek, Syriac, Vulgate) read the interrogative particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hYa</FONT> ("where?") which the <i>BHS</i> editors endorse. The textual corruption was caused by metathesis of the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">y</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">h</FONT>. Few translations follow the MT: "I will be thy/your king" (KJV, NKJV). Most emend the text: "Where is your king?" (RSV, NASB, NIV, NJPS, CEV).<br>

 <a name="fn421" href="hos.htm#fnB421"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:11)  The prefix-conjugation verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/Ta</FONT> ("I gave") refers to past-time action, specifying a definite past event (enthronement of Saul); therefore, this should be classified as a preterite. While imperfects are occasionally used in reference to past-time events, they depict repeated action in the past. See <i>IBHS</i> 31.2 and 31.6.<br>
 <a name="fn422" href="hos.htm#fnB422"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:12)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ou</FONT> has a three-fold range of meanings: (1) "iniquity" (2) "guilt" and (3) "punishment" (BDB 730). The oracle of 13:12-13 announces that Israel's punishment, though momentarily withheld, will suddenly come upon her like labor pains that will kill her.<br>

Here it figuratively depicts the record of Israel's sins being written down and permanently bound in a sealed scroll for safekeeping. The guilt of Israel's sin will be retained.<br>
 <a name="fn424" href="hos.htm#fnB424"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:14)  Some liberty has been taken in the translation of the first two lines of this verse to reflect the interpretation adopted. There are three interpretive options to v. 14: (1) In spite of Israel's sins, the LORD will redeem them from the threat of death and destruction (e.g., 11:8). However, against this view, the last line of 13:14 probably means that the LORD will not show compassion to Israel. (2) The LORD announces the triumphant victory over death through resurrection. However, although Paul uses the wording of Hosea 13:14 as an illustration of victory over death, the context of Hosea's message is the imminent judgment in 723-722 B.C. (3) The first two lines of 13:14 are rhetorical questions without explicit interrogative markers, implying negative answers: "I will not rescue them!" The next two lines in 13:14 are words of encouragement to Death and Sheol to destroy Israel. The final line announces that the LORD will not show compassion on Israel; he will not spare her.<br>

The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest the MT confused the common term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ja</FONT> ("brother") for the rarer term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wja</FONT> "marsh plant, reed plant" (Job 8:11) and "reed bed" (Gen 41:2, 18) (<i>HALOT</i> 1:31). This is an Egyptian loanword which is also attested in Ugaritic and Old Aramaic. The original text probably read either <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ayrpm WjaK</FONT> "he flourishes like a reed plant" (comparative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">K</FONT> + noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wja</FONT> "reed" followed by Hiphil participle ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">arp</FONT> "to flourish") or <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ayrpm Wja /yB</FONT> "he flourishes among the reeds" (preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/yb</FONT> "between," ms noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wja</FONT> "reed," Hiphil participle ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">arp</FONT>). The confusion over <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wja</FONT> ("reed-plant") probably led to secondary scribal errors: (1) faulty word-division of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ayrpm Wja</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ayrpy &lt;Wja</FONT>, and (2) secondary orthographic confusion of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">y</FONT> (<i>yod</i>) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">w</FONT> (<i>vav</i>) between <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;Wja</FONT> and resultant <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yja</FONT>.

 <a name="fn431" href="hos.htm#fnB431"><sup>34</sup></a><b>sn</b> (14:1)  Beginning with <b>13:16</b>, the verse numbers through <b>14:9</b> in the English Bible differ by one from the verse numbers in the Hebrew text (<i>BHS</i>), with <b>13:16 </b>ET = <b>14:1</b> HT, <b>14:1 </b>ET = <b>14:2</b> HT, etc., through <b>14:9</b> ET = <b>14:10</b> HT.

 <a name="fn433" href="hos.htm#fnB433"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:1)  <i>Heb</i> "his." This is a collective singular.<br>
 <a name="fn434" href="hos.htm#fnB434"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:1)  <i>Heb</i> "For you have stumbled in your iniquity."<br>
 <a name="fn435" href="hos.htm#fnB435"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:2)  <i>Heb</i> "Take words with you and return to the LORD."<br>
 <a name="fn436" href="hos.htm#fnB436"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:2)  The word order <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ou aCT-lK</FONT> is syntactically awkward. The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest rearranging the word order: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ou-lK aCT</FONT> ("Forgive all [our] iniquity!"). However, Gesenius suggests that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lK</FONT> ("all") does not function as the construct in the genitive phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ou-lK</FONT> ("all [our] iniquity"); it functions adverbially modifying the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aCT</FONT> ("Completely forgive!") (GKC &#167;128.<i>e</i>). <br>
 <a name="fn437" href="hos.htm#fnB437"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (14:2)  The repetition of the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jql</FONT> creates a striking wordplay in 14:2. If Israel will bring (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jql</FONT>) its confession to God, he will accept (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jql</FONT>) repentant Israel and completely forgive its sin.<br>
 <a name="fn438" href="hos.htm#fnB438"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:2)  <i>Heb</i> "and accept [our] speech." The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bof</FONT> is often confused with the common homonymic root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwf</FONT> I "good" (BDB 373). However, this is probably <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwf</FONT> IV "word, speech" (<i>HALOT</i> 2:372), a <i>hapax legomenon</i> that is related to the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bbf</FONT> "to speak" (<i>HALOT</i> 2:367) and the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hBf</FONT> "rumor" (<i>HALOT</i> 2:367). The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwf</FONT> "word; speech" refers to the repentant prayer mentioned in 14:1-3. Most translations relate it to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwf</FONT> I and treat it as (1) accusative direct object: "accept that which is good" (RSV, NJPS), "accept our good sacrifices" (CEV), or (2) adverbial accusative of manner: "receive [us] graciously" (KJV, NASB, NIV). Only TEV adopts this tactic: "accept our prayer." <br>
 <a name="fn439" href="hos.htm#fnB439"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tc</b> (14:2)  The MT reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrp</FONT> ("bulls"), but the LXX reflects <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yrp</FONT> ("fruit"): "that we may offer the fruit of [our] lips [as sacrifices to you]." Although the Greek expression in Heb 13:15 (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">karpon ceilewn</FONT>, "the fruit of lips") reflects this LXX phrase, the MT makes good sense as it stands; NT usage of the LXX should not be decisive in resolving OT textual problems. The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrp</FONT> ("bulls") functions as an adverbial accusative of state.<br>
 <a name="fn440" href="hos.htm#fnB440"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn </b> (14:3) <i>Heb</i> "For the orphan is shown compassion by you."<br>
 <a name="fn441" href="hos.htm#fnB441"><sup>8</sup></a><b>sn</b> (14:4)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">htbWvm</FONT> "waywardness" is from the same root as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbWv</FONT> "return!" in 14:1[2]. This repetition of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv </FONT>creates a wordplay which emphasizes reciprocity: if Israel will return (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbWv</FONT> ) to the LORD, he will cure her of the tendency to turn away (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">htbWvm</FONT>) from him.<br>
 <a name="fn442" href="hos.htm#fnB442"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:4)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbdn</FONT> ("voluntariness; free-will offering") is an adverbial accusative of manner: "freely, voluntarily" (BDB 621.1).<br>
 <a name="fn443" href="hos.htm#fnB443"><sup>10</sup></a><b>sn</b> (14:4)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bv</FONT> "will turn" (Qal perfect 3ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv</FONT> "to turn") continues the wordplay on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv</FONT> in 14:1-4[2-5]. If Israel will "return" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv</FONT>) to the LORD, he will heal Israel's tendency to "turn away" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">htbWvm</FONT>) and "turn" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bv</FONT>) from his anger. <br>
 <a name="fn444" href="hos.htm#fnB444"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:5)  <i>Heb</i> "like Lebanon" (also in the following verse). The phrase "a cedar of" does not appear in the Hebrew text; it is supplied in translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn445" href="hos.htm#fnB445"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:7)  Hosea uses the similar sounding terms <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ybvy Wbvy</FONT> ("the dwellers will return") to create a wordplay (paronomasia) between the roots <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv</FONT> ("to return") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bvy</FONT> ("to dwell; to reside").<br>
 <a name="fn446" href="hos.htm#fnB446"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:7)  <i>Heb</i> "they will cause the grain to live" or "they will revive the grain."<br>
 <a name="fn447" href="hos.htm#fnB447"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:8)  The Hebrew expression <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dou yl-hm</FONT> is a formula of repudiation/emphatic denial that God has anything in common with idols: "I want to have nothing to do with [...] any more!" (e.g., Judg 11:12; 2 Sam 16:10; 19:23; 1 Kgs 17:18; 2 Kgs 3:13; 2 Chr 35:21; Jer 2:18; Ps 50:16) (BDB 553.1.b.c).<br>
 <a name="fn448" href="hos.htm#fnB448"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:8)  The term "like" does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is supplied in the translation for clarity. <br>
 <a name="fn449" href="hos.htm#fnB449"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:8)  <i>Heb</i> "your fruit is found in me."<br>
 <a name="fn450" href="hos.htm#fnB450"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:9)  The shortened form of the prefix-conjugation verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/byw</FONT> indicates that it is a jussive rather than an imperfect. When a jussive comes from a superior to an inferior, it may connote exhortation and instruction or advice and counsel. For the functions of the jussive, see <i>IBHS</i> 34.3.
