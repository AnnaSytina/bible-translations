 <b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Heb</i> "The burden." The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aC*m^</FONT>, usually translated "oracle" (NEB, NASB, NIV, NRSV) or "utterance" (BDB 672 [III]), is a technical term in prophetic literature introducing a message from the LORD (see Zech 9:1; 12:1; Mal 1:1). Since it derives from a verb meaning "to carry" its original nuance was that of a burdensome message, that is, one with ominous content.<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="hab.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:1) <i>Heb</i> "The message [traditionally, "burden"] which Habakkuk the prophet saw."<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="hab.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  Or "deliver."<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="hab.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:3) <i>Heb</i> "Why do you make me see injustice?" Here "see" is figurative for "experience, undergo."<br>
 <a name="fn4" href="hab.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:3) <i>Heb</i> "Why do you look at wrongdoing?" <br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:3)  Habakkuk complains that God tolerates social <i>injustice</i> and fails to intervene on behalf of the oppressed (<i>put up with wrongdoing</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="hab.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:3) <i>Heb</i> "are before."<br>
 <a name="fn6" href="hab.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:3) <i>Heb</i> "and there is conflict and strife he lifts up." The present translation takes the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aC*y]</FONT> in the sense of "carry, bear," and understands the subject as indefinite ("one").<br>
 <a name="fn7" href="hab.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:4) <i>Heb</i> "is numb," i.e., like a hand that has "fallen asleep" (see Ps 77:2).<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="hab.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:4) <i>Heb</i> "never goes out."<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="hab.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  Or "for."<br>

 <a name="fn12" href="hab.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:4) <i>Heb</i> "comes out crooked."<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="hab.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  Or "look among the nations and observe." The imperatival forms in v. 5 are plural, indicating that the Lord's message is for the whole nation, not just the prophet.<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="hab.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  The Hebrew text combines the Hitpael and Qal imperatival forms of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmt</FONT>, "be amazed." A literal translation might read, "Shock yourselves and be shocked!" The repetition of sounds draws attention to the statement. The imperatives here have the force of an emphatic assertion. On this use of the imperative in Hebrew, see GKC &#167;110.<i>c</i> and <i>IBHS</i> &#167;34.4.c.<br>
 <a name="fn15" href="hab.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tc </b> (1:5) <i>Heb</i> "for a work working in your days." Following the LXX reading, some supply a first person singular pronoun with the participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lup</FONT>, but ellipsis of a first singular pronoun before participles is relatively rare (see GKC &#167;116.<i>s</i>). Perhaps an original <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ykna</FONT> (or <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yna</FONT>) followed the initial <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk</FONT> and was omitted by homoioteleuton.<br>
 <a name="fn16" href="hab.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:5) <i>Heb</i> "you will not believe when it is told." The force of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk</FONT> may be "when," "if," or "even though," in this context. For these uses of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk</FONT> see <i>HALOT</i> 471.<br>
 <a name="fn17" href="hab.htm#fnB17"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:6) <i>Heb</i> "raise up."<br>
 <a name="fn18" href="hab.htm#fnB18"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:6) <i>Heb</i> "bitter." Other translation options for this context include "fierce" (NASB, NRSV); "savage" (NEB); or "grim."<br>
 <a name="fn19" href="hab.htm#fnB19"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:6) <i>Heb</i> "hasty, quick." Some translate here "impetuous" (so NEB, NASB, NIV, NRSV) or "rash," but in this context greed may very well be the idea. The Babylonians move quickly and recklessly ahead in their greedy quest to expand their empire.<br>
 <a name="fn20" href="hab.htm#fnB20"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:6) <i>Heb</i> "the open spaces."<br>
 <a name="fn21" href="hab.htm#fnB21"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:7) <i>Heb</i> "from him his justice, even his lifting up, goes out." In this context <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tac</FONT> probably has the nuance "authority." See R. D. Patterson, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah</i>, 150.<br>
 <a name="fn22" href="hab.htm#fnB22"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:8) <i>Heb</i> "sharper," in the sense of "keener" or "more alert." Some translate "quicker," on the basis of the parallelism (see <i>HALOT</i> 291).<br>
 <a name="fn23" href="hab.htm#fnB23"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:8) <i>Heb</i> "wolves of the evening," that is, wolves that prowl at night. The present translation assumes an emendation to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbru</FONT> ("desert"). On this phrase see also Zeph 3:3.<br>
 <a name="fn24" href="hab.htm#fnB24"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:8)  Or "horsemen," "cavalry."<br>
 <a name="fn25" href="hab.htm#fnB25"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:8)  The precise nuance of the rare verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vwp</FONT> is unclear here. Elsewhere it is used of animals jumping or leaping (see Jer 50:11; Mal 4:2).<br>
 <a name="fn26" href="hab.htm#fnB26"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:8)  Or "eagle" (so NASB, NRSV). The term can refer to either eagles or vultures, but in this context of gruesome destruction and death "vulture" is preferred.<br>
 <a name="fn27" href="hab.htm#fnB27"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:8) <i>Heb</i> "they fly like a vulture/an eagle quickly to devour." The direct object "their prey" is not included in the Hebrew text but is implied.<br>
 <a name="fn28" href="hab.htm#fnB28"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:9) <i>Heb</i> "come."<br>
 <a name="fn29" href="hab.htm#fnB29"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:9) <i>Heb</i> "The totality of their faces is to the east" (or "is forward"). The precise meaning of the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tmgm</FONT> is unclear. For a discussion of options see J. J. M. Roberts, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah</i>, 93. NEB has "a sea of faces rolls on"; NIV "their hordes advance like a desert wind"; NRSV "with faces pressing forward."<br>
 <a name="fn30" href="hab.htm#fnB30"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:9) <i>Heb</i> "and he gathers like sand, prisoners."<br>
 <a name="fn31" href="hab.htm#fnB31"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:10) <i>Heb</i> "they heap up dirt." This is a reference to the piling up of earthen ramps in the process of laying siege to a fortified city.<br>
 <a name="fn32" href="hab.htm#fnB32"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  The precise meaning of v. 11a is uncertain. The present translation assumes the first line further describes the Babylonian hordes, comparing them to a destructive wind. Another option is to understand <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jwr</FONT> as "spirit," rather than "wind," and take the form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;vaw</FONT> with what precedes (as suggested by the scribal punctuation). Repointing this form as a geminate verb from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;mv</FONT>, "be astonished," one can then translate the line, "The spirit passed on and departed, and I was astonished." In this case the line describes the cessation of the divine revelation which began in v. 5. For a detailed defense of this view, see J. J. M. Roberts, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah</i>, 97-100.<br>
 <a name="fn33" href="hab.htm#fnB33"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:11) <i>Heb</i> "and guilty is the one whose strength is his god." This assumes that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;va </FONT>is a predicate adjective meaning "guilty" and that it relates to what follows.<br>
 <a name="fn34" href="hab.htm#fnB34"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:12) <i>Heb</i> "Are you not from antiquity, O LORD?" The rhetorical question expects the answer, "Yes, of course." The present translation reflects the force of the rhetorical question, rendering it as an affirmation. When used in a temporal sense the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;dqm</FONT> means "from antiquity, ancient times," often referring to earlier periods in Israel's history. See its use in Neh 12:46; Pss 74:12; 77:11; Isa 45:21; 46:10; Mic 5:2.<br>
 <a name="fn35" href="hab.htm#fnB35"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:12) <i>Heb</i> "My God, my holy one." God's "holiness" in this context is his sovereign transcendence as the righteous judge of the world (see vv. 12b-13a), thus the translation "My sovereign God."<br>
 <a name="fn36" href="hab.htm#fnB36"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:12)  The MT reads, "we will not die," but an ancient scribal tradition has "you [i.e., God] will not die." This is preferred as a more difficult reading that can explain the rise of the other variant. Later scribes who copied the manuscripts did not want to associate the idea of death with God in any way, so they softened the statement to refer to humanity.<br>
 <a name="fn37" href="hab.htm#fnB37"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:12) <i>Heb</i> "him," a collective singular referring to the Babylonians. The plural pronoun "them" has been used in the translation in keeping with contemporary English style.<br>
 <a name="fn38" href="hab.htm#fnB38"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:12) <i>Heb</i> "for judgment."<br>
 <a name="fn39" href="hab.htm#fnB39"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:12) <i>Heb</i> "Rock" or "Cliff." This divine epithet views God as a place where one can go to be safe from danger. The translation "Protector" conveys the force of the metaphor (cf. NEB "O mighty God").<br>
 <a name="fn40" href="hab.htm#fnB40"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:12) <i>Heb</i> "to correct, reprove."<br>
 <a name="fn41" href="hab.htm#fnB41"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:13) <i>Heb</i> "[you] are too pure of eyes." God's "eyes" here signify what he looks at with approval. His "eyes" are "pure" in the sense that he refuses to tolerate any wrongdoing in his presence. <br>
 <a name="fn42" href="hab.htm#fnB42"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:13) <i>Heb</i> "to see." Here "see" is figurative for "tolerate," "put up with."<br>
 <a name="fn43" href="hab.htm#fnB43"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:13) <i>Heb</i> "to look at." Cf. NEB "who canst not countenance wrongdoing"; NASB "You can not look on wickedness with favor."<br>
 <a name="fn44" href="hab.htm#fnB44"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:13) <i>Heb</i> "Why do you look at treacherous ones?" The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dgb</FONT>, "be treacherous," is often used of those who are disloyal or violate agreements. See <i>TDOT</i> 1:470-73.<br>
 <a name="fn45" href="hab.htm#fnB45"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13)  Or "swallow up."<br>
 <a name="fn46" href="hab.htm#fnB46"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:13) <i>Heb</i> "more innocent than themselves."<br>
 <a name="fn47" href="hab.htm#fnB47"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:14)  The Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">cmr</FONT> usually refers to animals that creep, but here (note the parallel line) the referent seems to be marine animals that glide through the water. See also Ps 104:25.<br>
 <a name="fn48" href="hab.htm#fnB48"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:15) <i>Heb</i> "he"; the referent (the Babylonian tyrant) has been specified in the translation for clarity (cf. NASB "The Chaldeans"; NIV "The wicked foe"; NRSV "The enemy"). Babylonian imperialism is here compared to a professional fisherman who repeatedly brings in his catch and has plenty to eat.<br>
 <a name="fn49" href="hab.htm#fnB49"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:15)  Apparently two different types of fishing nets are referred to here. The <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;rj</FONT>, or "throw net," was used by fishermen standing on the shore (see Ezek 47:10), while the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">trmkm</FONT>, or "dragnet," was utilized by men in a boat. See R. D. Patterson, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah</i>, 165.<br>
 <a name="fn50" href="hab.htm#fnB50"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:15) <i>Heb</i> "and he gathers."<br>

 <a name="fn52" href="hab.htm#fnB52"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:16) <i>Heb</i> "therefore."<br>
 <a name="fn53" href="hab.htm#fnB53"><sup>54</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:16)  The fishing implements (<i>throw net </i>and <i>dragnet</i>) represent Babylonian military might. The prophet depicts them arrogantly worshiping their own power (<i>sacrifices...burns incense</i>, see as well v. 11b).<br>

 <a name="fn59" href="hab.htm#fnB59"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:17) <i>Heb</i> "kill."<br>
 <a name="fn60" href="hab.htm#fnB60"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:17)  Or "without showing compassion."<br>
 <a name="fn61" href="hab.htm#fnB61"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:1)  Habakkuk compares himself to a watchman <i>stationed on the city wall</i> who keeps his eyes open for approaching messengers or danger.<br>
 <a name="fn62" href="hab.htm#fnB62"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:1)  The word "know" is supplied in the translation for clarification.<br>
 <a name="fn63" href="hab.htm#fnB63"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:1) <i>Heb</i> "concerning my correction [or, "reproof"]."<br>
 <a name="fn64" href="hab.htm#fnB64"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:2) <i>Heb</i> "the LORD answered and said." The redundant expression "answered and said" has been simplified in the translation as "responded."<br>
 <a name="fn65" href="hab.htm#fnB65"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:2) <i>Heb</i> "[the] vision."<br>
 <a name="fn66" href="hab.htm#fnB66"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:2)  Or "reads from."<br>
 <a name="fn67" href="hab.htm#fnB67"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:2) <i>Heb</i> "might run," which here probably means "run [through it quickly with one's eyes]," that is, read it easily.<br>
 <a name="fn68" href="hab.htm#fnB68"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:3)  <i>Heb</i> "For the vision is still for the appointed time." The Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dwu</FONT>, "still," is better emended to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">du</FONT>, "witness," in light of the parallelism (see the note on the word "turn out" in the following line). The "appointed time" refers to the time when the divine judgment anticipated in vv. 6-20 will be realized.<br>
 <a name="fn69" href="hab.htm#fnB69"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:3) <i>Heb</i> "and a witness to the end and it does not lie." The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jpy</FONT> has been traditionally understood as a verb form from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jwp</FONT>, "puff, blow" (cf. NEB "it will come in breathless haste"; NASB "it hastens toward the goal") but recent scholarship has demonstrated that it is actually a noun meaning "witness" (cf. NIV "it speaks of the end / and will not prove false"; NRSV "it speaks of the end, and does not lie"). See J. J. M. Roberts, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah</i>, 106. "The end" corresponds to "the appointed time" of the preceding line and refers to the time when the prophecy to follow will be fulfilled.<br>
 <a name="fn70" href="hab.htm#fnB70"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:3)  <i>Heb</i> "it"; the referent (the message) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn71" href="hab.htm#fnB71"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:3) <i>Heb</i> "If it should delay, wait for it." The Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/wzj</FONT>, "vision, message," is the subject of the third person verbs in v. 3 and the antecedent of the pronominal suffix in the phrase "for it."<br>
 <a name="fn72" href="hab.htm#fnB72"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  The meaning of this line is unclear, primarily because of the uncertainty surrounding the second word, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlpu</FONT>. Some read this as an otherwise unattested verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lpu</FONT>, "swell," from which are derived nouns meaning "mound" and "hemorrhoid." This "swelling" is then understood in an abstract sense, "swell with pride." This would yield a translation, "As for the proud, his desires are not right within him" (cf. NASB "as for the proud one"; NIV "he is puffed up"; NRSV "Look at the proud!"). A multitude of other interpretations of this line, many of which involve emendations of the problematic form, may be found in the commentaries and periodical literature. The present translation assumes an emendation to a Pual form of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[lu</FONT>, "be faint, exhausted." (See its use in the Pual in Isa 51:20, and in the Hitpael in Am 8:13 and Jon 4:8.) In the antithetical parallelism of the verse, it corresponds to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hyj</FONT>, "live." The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wb wvpn hrvy al</FONT>, literally, "not upright his desire within him," is taken as a substantival clause that contrasts with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qydx</FONT>, "the righteous one," and serves as the subject of the preceding verb. Here <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vpn</FONT> is understood in the sense of "desire" (see BDB 660-61 for a list of passages where the word carries this sense).<br>
 <a name="fn73" href="hab.htm#fnB73"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  Or "righteous." The oppressed individuals mentioned in 1:4 are probably in view here.<br>
 <a name="fn74" href="hab.htm#fnB74"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  Or "will live." In the immediate context this probably refers to physical preservation through the present oppression and the coming judgment (see Hab 3:18-20).<br>
 <a name="fn75" href="hab.htm#fnB75"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  Or "loyalty"; or "faithfulness." The Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnwma</FONT> has traditionally been translated "faith," but the term nowhere else refers to "belief" per se. When used of human character and conduct it carries the notion of "honesty, integrity, reliability, faithfulness." The antecedent of the suffix has been understood in different ways. It could refer to God's faithfulness, but in this case one would expect a first person suffix (the original form of the LXX has here, "my faithfulness"). Others understand the "vision" to be the antecedent. In this case the reliability of the prophecy is in view. For a statement of this view, see J. J. M. Roberts, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah</i>, 111-12. The present translation assumes that the preceding word, "[the] innocent," is the antecedent. In this case the LORD is assuring Habakkuk that those who are truly innocent will be preserved through the coming oppression and judgment by their godly lifestyle, for God ultimately rewards this type of conduct. In contrast to these innocent people, those with impure desires (epitomized by the greedy Babylonians, see v. 5) will not be able to withstand God's judgment (v. 4a). <br>
 <a name="fn76" href="hab.htm#fnB76"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:5) <i>Heb</i> "Indeed wine betrays a proud man and he does not dwell." The meaning of the last verb, "dwell," is uncertain. Many take it as a denominative of the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwn</FONT>, "dwelling place." In this case it would carry the idea, "he does not settle down," and picture the drunkard as restless (cf. NIV "never at rest"; NASB "does not stay at home"). Some relate the verb to an Arabic cognate and translate, "he will not succeed, reach his goal."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:5)  The Babylonian tyrant is the <i>proud, restless man</i> described in this line (as the last line of the verse, with its reference to the conquest of the nations, makes clear). Wine is probably a metaphor for imperialistic success. The more success the Babylonians experience, the more greedy they become (just as a drunkard wants more and more wine to satisfy his thirst). But eventually this greed will lead to their downfall, for God will not tolerate such imperialism and will judge the Babylonians appropriately (vv. 6-20).<br>
 <a name="fn77" href="hab.htm#fnB77"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:5) <i>Heb</i> "who opens wide like Sheol his throat." Here <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vpn</FONT> is understood in a physical sense here, meaning "throat," which in turn is figurative for the appetite. See <i>HALOT</i> 712, and H. W. Wolff, <i>Anthropology of the Old Testament</i>, 11-12.<br>
 <a name="fn78" href="hab.htm#fnB78"><sup>18</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:5)  <i>Sheol</i> is the proper name of the subterranean world which was regarded as the land of the dead. In ancient Canaanite thought Death was a powerful god whose appetite was never satisfied. In the OT Sheol/Death, though not deified, is personified as greedy and as having a voracious appetite. See Prov 30:15-16; Isa 5:14; also see L. I. J. Stadelmann, <i>The Hebrew Conception of the World</i>, 168.<br>

 <a name="fn84" href="hab.htm#fnB84"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6)  This question is interjected parenthetically, perhaps to express rhetorically the pain and despair felt by the Babylonians' victims.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (2:15)  <i>Forcing them to drink from the bowl of your furious anger</i>. The Babylonian's harsh treatment of others is compared to intoxicating wine which the Babylonians force the nations to drink so they can humiliate them. Cf. the imagery in Rev 14:10.<br>

 <a name="fn109" href="hab.htm#fnB109"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tc</b> (2:17)  The Hebrew appears to read literally, "and the violence against the animals [which] he terrified." The verb form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/tyjy</FONT> appears to be a Hiphil imperfect third masculine singular with third feminine plural suffix (the antecedent being the animals) from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ttj</FONT>, "be terrified." The translation above follows the lead of the LXX and assumes a reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jtjy</FONT>, "(the violence against the animals) will terrify you" (cf. NRSV "the destruction of the animals will terrify you"; NIV "and your destruction of animals will terrify you"). In this case the verb is a Hiphil imperfect third masculine singular with second masculine singular suffix (the antecedent being Babylon). This provides better symmetry with the preceding line, where Babylon's violence is the subject of the verb "cover." <br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:17)  The language may anticipate Nebuchadnezzar's utilization of trees from the Lebanon forest in building projects. <i>Lebanon</i> and its animals probably represent the western Palestinian states conquered by the Babylonians.<br>

 <a name="fn117" href="hab.htm#fnB117"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:19)  Though the Hebrew text has no formal interrogative marker here, the context indicates that the statement should be taken as a rhetorical question anticipating the answer, "Of course not!" (so also NIV, NRSV).<br>
 <a name="fn118" href="hab.htm#fnB118"><sup>58</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:20)  Or "holy temple." The LORD's heavenly palace, rather than the earthly temple, is probably in view here (see Ps 11:4; Mic 1:2-3). The Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vdq</FONT> ("holy") here refers to the sovereign transcendence associated with his palace. <br>
 <a name="fn119" href="hab.htm#fnB119"><sup>59</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:20)  Or "Be quiet before him, all the earth!"<br>

The meaning of this word is uncertain. It may refer to the literary genre of the prayer or to the musical style to be employed when it is sung. The NEB leaves the term untranslated; several other modern translations transliterate the term into English, sometimes with explanatory notes (NASB, NRSV "according to Shigionoth"; NIV "On <i>shigionoth</i>").<br>

 <a name="fn126" href="hab.htm#fnB126"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:2) <i>Heb</i> "make known." The implied object is "your deeds"; the pronoun "them," referring to "deeds" in the previous line, was employed in the translation to avoid redundancy. The suffix on the form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">whyyj</FONT>, "revive it," does double duty in the parallelism.<br>
 <a name="fn127" href="hab.htm#fnB127"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:2) <i>Heb</i> "in turmoil remember [to show] compassion."<br>
 <a name="fn128" href="hab.htm#fnB128"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:3)  In vv. 3-15 there is a mixture of eleven prefixed verbal forms (without <i>vav</i> consecutive or with <i>vav</i> conjunctive), sixteen suffixed forms, and three prefixed forms with <i>vav</i> consecutive. All of the forms are best taken as indicating completed action from the speaker's standpoint (all of the prefixed forms being regarded as preterites). The forms could be translated with the past tense, but this would be misleading, for this is not a mere recital of God's deeds in Israel's past history. Habakkuk here describes, in terms reminiscent of past theophanies, his prophetic vision of a future theophany (see v. 7, "I saw"). From the prophet's visionary standpoint the theophany is "as good as done." The present translation uses the English present tense throughout these verses to avoid misunderstanding. A similar strategy is followed by the NEB; in contrast note the NIV and NRSV, which consistently use past tenses throughout the section, and the NASB, which employs present tenses in vv. 3-5 and mostly past tenses in vv. 6-15.<br>

 <a name="fn134" href="hab.htm#fnB134"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:3) <i>Heb</i> "praise." This could mean that the earth responds in praise as they observe God's splendor in the skies. However, the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlht</FONT> ("praise") can stand by metonymy for what prompts it (i.e., fame, glory, deeds). See BDB 240.<br>
 <a name="fn135" href="hab.htm#fnB135"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:4) <i>Heb</i> "[His] radiance is like light." Some see a reference to sunlight, but the Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rwa</FONT> here refers to lightning, as the context indicates (see vv. 4b, 9, 11).

 <a name="fn136" href="hab.htm#fnB136"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:4) <i>Heb</i> "two horns from his hand to him." Sharp, pointed lightning bolts have a "horn-like" appearance.

 <a name="fn137" href="hab.htm#fnB137"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:4) <i>Heb</i> "and there [is] the covering of his strength"; or "and there is his strong covering." The meaning of the line is unclear. The point may be that the lightning bolts are merely a covering, or outward display, of God's raw power.

 <a name="fn138" href="hab.htm#fnB138"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:5)  Parallelism (note "plague") favors the meaning "pestilence," but usage elsewhere suggests a destructive bolt of fire may be in view. See BDB 958. <br>

The passive participle of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ubv</FONT>, "swear an oath," also occurs in Ezek 21:23 ET (21:28 HT) of those who have sworn allegiance. Here the LORD's arrows are personified and viewed as having received a commission which they have vowed to uphold. In Jer 47:6-7 the LORD's sword is given such a charge.

A literal rendering like "You split the earth with rivers" (so NIV, NRSV) suggests geological activity to the modern reader, but in the present context of a violent thunderstorm, the idea of streams swollen to torrents by downpours better fits the imagery.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:9)  As the LORD comes in a thunderstorm the downpour causes streams to swell to river-like proportions and spread over the surface of the ground, causing <i>flash-floods</i>.<br>
