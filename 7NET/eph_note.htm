 <b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Grk</i> "Paul." The word "from" is not in the Greek text, but has been supplied to indicate the sender of the letter.<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="eph.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:1)  The earliest and most important MSS omit "in Ephesus" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>46 <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT>* B* 6 1739 and apparently Marcion's list), yet the opening line of this epistle makes little sense without them ("to the saints who are and are faithful..."? or perhaps "to the saints who are also faithful," though with this sense the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ou\sin</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ousin</FONT>] is redundant and the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>] is treated somewhat unnaturally). What is interesting is Marcion's canon list which offers the letter to the Laodiceans among Paul's authentic epistles. This, coupled with some internal evidence that the writer did not know his audience personally (cf. 1:15; 3:2; absence of personal names throughout), suggests that Ephesians was an encyclical letter, intended for more than one audience. Does this mean that the shorter reading is to be preferred? Yes and no. A plausible scenario is as follows: Paul sent the letter from Rome, intending it first to go to Ephesus. At the same time, Colossians was dispatched. Going counterclockwise through Asia Minor, this letter would first come to Ephesus, the port of entry, then to Laodicea, then Colossae. Tychicus' instructions may well have been for each church to "fill in the blank" on the address line. The church at Ephesus would have certainly made the most copies, being Paul's home base for nearly three years. Hence, most of the surviving copies have "in Ephesus" in v. 1. But one might expect a hint of evidence that Laodicea also made a few copies: both Marcion's list and Col 4:16 may well imply this. What is to account for the early Alexandrian evidence, then? These MSS were probably made from a very early copy, one reflecting the blank line before each church filled it in. Although it is of course only speculation (as is necessary in a historical investigation lacking some of the pieces to the puzzle), this scenario accounts for all of the data: (1) "in Ephesus" in most MSS; (2) Laodicea in Marcion's list and Col 4:16; (3) the lack of an addressee in the earliest witnesses; (4) why the earliest witnesses' reading must be rejected as <i>too</i> hard; and (5) why Paul seems not to know the readership. In sum, is "in Ephesus" original? Yes and no. <i>Some</i> address belongs there; <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn *Efevsw/</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">en Efesw</FONT>) is the predominant address; but several other churches also received this circular letter as their own. For this reason the phrase has been placed in single brackets in the translation.<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="eph.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Grk </i>"and faithful." The construction in Greek (as well as Paul's style) suggests that the saints are identical to the faithful; hence, the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>) is best left untranslated. See M. Barth, <i>Ephesians </i>(AB), 1:68 and D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax</i>, 282.<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="eph.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  <i>Grk</i> "Grace to you and peace."<br>
 <a name="fn4" href="eph.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:3)  Eph 1:3-14 comprises one long sentence in Greek, with three major sections. Each section ends with a note of praise for God (vv. 6, 11, 14), focusing on a different member of the Trinity. After an opening summary of all the saints' spiritual blessings (v. 3), the first section (vv. 4-6) offers up praise that the Father has chosen us in eternity past; the second section (vv. 7-11) offers up praise that the Son has redeemed us in the historical past (i.e., at the cross); the third section (vv. 12-14) offers up praise that the Holy Spirit has sealed us in our personal past, at the point of conversion.<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="eph.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:3)  The verb is lacking in Greek; either the optative ("be") or the indicative ("is") can be supplied. The indicative suggests that the blessedness is an intrinsic part of God's character, while the optative suggests that he ought to be praised or blessed. Although a decision is difficult, both the Hebrew equivalents and the general Pauline style (of beginning with statements and moving to obligations) argues for the indicative. Cf. also 2 Cor 1:3. <br>
 <a name="fn6" href="eph.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  Or "enriched," "conferred blessing."<br>
 <a name="fn7" href="eph.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  <i>Grk</i> "just as." Eph 1:3-14 are one long sentence in Greek that must be broken up in English translation. Verse 4 expresses the reason why God the Father is blessed (cf. BAGD 391 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaqwv"</FONT> 3).<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="eph.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  <i>Grk</i> "in love," at the end of the verse. This prepositional phrase may modify one of three words or phrases: "chose," "holy and unblemished," or "by predestining" in v. 5. If it modifies "chose," it refers to God's motivation in that election. If it modifies "holy and unblemished," it specifies that our holiness cannot be divorced from love. If it modifies "by predestining" (v. 5), again the motivation of God's choice is love.<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="eph.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  <i>Grk</i> "in him."<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="eph.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:4)  The Greek word translated <i>unblemished</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajmwvmou"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">amwmous</FONT>) is often used of an acceptable paschal lamb. Christ, as our paschal lamb, is also said to be unblemished (Heb 9:14; 1 Pet 1:19). Since believers are in Christ, God views them positionally and will make them ultimately without blemish as well (Jude 24; Eph 5:27; Col 1:22).<br>
 <a name="fn11" href="eph.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  <i>Grk </i>"before him."<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="eph.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Grk </i>"by predestining." Verse 5 begins with an aorist participle dependent on the main verb in v. 4 ("chose"). <br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:5)  <i>By predestining. </i>The aorist participle may be translated either causally ("because he predestined," "having predestined") or instrumentally ("by predestining"). A causal nuance would suggest that God's predestination of certain individuals prompted his choice of them. An instrumental nuance would suggest that the means by which God's choice was accomplished was by predestination. The instrumental view is somewhat more likely in light of normal Greek syntax (i.e., an aorist participle <i>following</i> an aorist main verb is more likely to be instrumental than causal).<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="eph.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Grk</i> "to himself" after "through Jesus Christ."<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="eph.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:5)  <i>Adoption as his sons</i> (Greek <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uiJoqesivan</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Juioqesian</FONT>) is different from spiritual birth as children. All true believers have been born as children of God and will be adopted as sons of God. The adoption is both a future reality, and in some sense, already true. To be adopted as a son means to have the full rights of an heir. Thus, although in the ancient world, only boys could be adopted as sons, in God's family all children--both male and female--are adopted.<br>
 <a name="fn15" href="eph.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  Or "good pleasure."<br>
 <a name="fn16" href="eph.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  <i>Grk</i> "the beloved." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hjgaphmevnw/</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">hgaphmenw</FONT>) means "beloved," but often bears connotations of "only beloved" in an exclusive sense. "His dearly loved Son" picks up this connotation.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:6)  God's grace can be poured out on believers only because of what Christ has done for them. Hence, he bestows his grace on us because we are <b><i>in</i></b><i> his dearly loved Son</i>.<br>
 <a name="fn17" href="eph.htm#fnB17"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  <i>Grk</i> "in whom" (the relative clause of v. 7 is subordinate to v. 6). The "him" refers to Christ.<br>
 <a name="fn18" href="eph.htm#fnB18"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  <i>Grk</i> "making known, revealing" (for "He did this when he revealed"). Verse 9 begins with a participle dependent on "lavished" in v. 8.<br>
 <a name="fn19" href="eph.htm#fnB19"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  Or "mystery." In the NT <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">musthvrion</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">musthrion</FONT>) refers to a divine secret previously undisclosed. <br>
 <a name="fn20" href="eph.htm#fnB20"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  Or "purposed," "publicly displayed." Cf. Rom 3:25.<br>
 <a name="fn21" href="eph.htm#fnB21"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  <i>Grk</i> "in him"; the referent (Christ) has been specified in the translation for the sake of clarity.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:9)  <i>In Christ. </i>KJV has "in himself" as though the antecedent were God the Father. Although possible, the notion of the verb <i>set forth</i> (Greek <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">protivqhmi</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">protiqhmi</FONT>) implies a plan that is carried out in history (cf. Rom 1:13; 3:25) and thus more likely refers to Christ.<br>
 <a name="fn22" href="eph.htm#fnB22"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  The precise meaning of the infinitive <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajnakefalaiwvsasqai</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">anakefalaiwsasqai</FONT>) in v. 10 is difficult to determine since it was used relatively infrequently in Greek literature and only twice in the NT (here and Rom 13:9). While there have been several suggestions, three deserve mention: (1) "To sum up." In Rom 13:9, using the same term, Paul says that the law may be "<i>summarized</i> in one command, to love your neighbor as yourself." The idea then in Eph 1:10 would be that all things in heaven and on earth can be summed up and <i>made sense out of</i> in relation to Christ. (2) "To renew." If this is the nuance of the verb then all things in heaven and earth, after their plunge into sin and ruin, are renewed by the coming of Christ and his redemption. (3) "To head up." In this translation the idea is that Christ, in the fullness of the times, has been exalted so as to be appointed as the ruler (i.e., "head") over all things in heaven and earth (including the church). That this is perhaps the best understanding of the verb is evidenced by the repeated theme of Christ's exaltation and reign in Ephesians and by the connection to the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kefalhv-</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kefalh-</FONT>) language of 1:22 (cf. Schlier, <i>TDNT </i>3:682; L&amp;N 63.8; M. Barth, <i>Ephesians</i> [AB], 1:89-92; <i>contra</i> A. T. Lincoln, <i>Ephesians </i>[WBC], 32-33).<br>
 <a name="fn23" href="eph.htm#fnB23"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  <i>Grk</i> "the heavens."<br>
 <a name="fn24" href="eph.htm#fnB24"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:10)  <i>And the things on earth. </i>Verse 10 ends with "in him." The redundancy keeps the focus on Christ at the expense of good Greek style. Verse 11 repeats the reference with a relative pronoun ("in whom")--again, at the expense of good Greek style. Although the syntax is awkward, the theology is rich. This is not the first time that a NT writer was so overcome with awe for his Lord that he seems to have lost control of his pen. Indeed, it happened frequently enough that some have labeled their christologically motivated solecisms an "apostolic disease."<br>
 <a name="fn25" href="eph.htm#fnB25"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  <i>Grk</i> "in whom," as a continuation of the previous verse.<br>
 <a name="fn26" href="eph.htm#fnB26"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  <i>Grk</i> "we were appointed by lot." The notion of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">klhrovw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">klhrow</FONT>) in the OT was to "appoint a portion by lot" (the more frequent cognate verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">klhronomevw</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">klhronomew</FONT>] meant "obtain a portion by lot"). In the passive, as here, the idea is that "we were appointed [as a portion] by lot" (BAGD 435 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">klhrovw</FONT> 1).<br>
 <b>sn </b> (1:11) <i>God's own possession</i>. Although God is not mentioned explicitly in the Greek text, it is clear from the context that he has chosen believers for himself. Just as with the nation Israel, the church is God's chosen portion or possession (cf. Deut 32:8-9).<br>
 <a name="fn27" href="eph.htm#fnB27"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:12)  Or "who had already hoped."<br>
 <a name="fn28" href="eph.htm#fnB28"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:12)  Or "the Messiah." <br>
 <a name="fn29" href="eph.htm#fnB29"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13)  <i>Grk</i> "in whom when you also," continuing the sentence from v. 12.<br>
 <a name="fn30" href="eph.htm#fnB30"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13)  <i>Grk</i> "in whom also having believed."<br>
 <a name="fn31" href="eph.htm#fnB31"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13)  Or "you were sealed."<br>
 <a name="fn32" href="eph.htm#fnB32"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13)  <i>Grk</i> "the Holy Spirit of promise."<br>
 <a name="fn33" href="eph.htm#fnB33"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:14)  Or "first installment," "pledge," "deposit."<br>
 <b>sn </b> (1:14) <i>Down payment. </i>The Greek word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajrrabwvn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">arrabwn</FONT>) denotes the first payment or first installment of money or goods which serves as a guarantee or pledge for the completion of the transaction. In the NT the term is used only figuratively of the Holy Spirit as the <i>down payment </i>of the blessings promised by God (it is used also in 2 Cor 1:22 and 5:5). In the "already--not yet" scheme of the NT the possession of the Spirit now by believers ("already") can be viewed as a guarantee that God will give them the balance of the promised blessings in the future ("not yet").<br>
 <a name="fn34" href="eph.htm#fnB34"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:14)  <i>Grk</i> "the possession."<br>
 <a name="fn35" href="eph.htm#fnB35"><sup>36</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:15)  The conjunctive phrase <i>For this reason</i> points back to the preceding section, vv. 3-14, which is also summed up in this verse in the expression <i>since I have heard of your faith</i>. In other words, Paul's prayer can be made for his audience because he knows that they are true believers.<br>
 <a name="fn36" href="eph.htm#fnB36"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:15)  <i>Grk</i> "even I."<br>
 <a name="fn37" href="eph.htm#fnB37"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:15)  <i>Grk</i> "having also heard."<br>
 <a name="fn38" href="eph.htm#fnB38"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:16)  <i>Grk</i> "making mention [of you]."<br>
 <a name="fn39" href="eph.htm#fnB39"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:17)  <i>Grk</i> "that"; v. 17 is a subordinate clause to v. 16 ("I pray" in v. 17 is implied from v. 16). Eph 1:15-23 constitutes one sentence in Greek, but a new sentence was started here in the translation in light of contemporary English usage.<br>
 <a name="fn40" href="eph.htm#fnB40"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:17)  Or "glorious Father." The genitive "of glory" is most likely attributive.<br>
 <a name="fn41" href="eph.htm#fnB41"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:17) <i> </i>Or "the Spirit of wisdom and revelation," or "a spirit of wisdom and revelation." Verse 17 involves a complex exegetical problem revolving around the Greek term <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pneu'ma</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">pneuma</FONT>). Some take it to mean "the Spirit," others "a spirit," and still others "spiritual." (1) If "the Spirit" is meant, the idea must be a metonymy of cause for effect, because Paul had just indicated in vv. 13-14 that the Spirit was already given (hence, there is no need for him to pray that he be given again). But the effect of the Spirit is wisdom and revelation. (2) If "a spirit" is meant, the idea may be that the readers will have the ability to gain wisdom and insight as they read Paul's letters, but the exact meaning of "a spirit" remains ambiguous. (3) To take the genitives following <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pneu'ma</FONT> as <i>attributed</i> genitives (see D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax,</i> 89-91), in which the head noun ("S/spirit") functions semantically like an adjective ("spiritual") is both grammatically probable and exegetically satisfying.<br>
 <a name="fn42" href="eph.htm#fnB42"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:17)  <i>Grk</i> "in the knowledge of him."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:17)  The point of the <i>knowledge of him</i> has nothing to do with what God knows, but with what believers are to know (hence, "<b><i>your</i></b><i>...knowledge</i>"). Further, Paul's prayer is that this knowledge of God would increase, not simply be initiated, since he is writing to believers who already know God (hence, "<i>your <b>growing</b> knowledge of him</i>").<br>
 <a name="fn43" href="eph.htm#fnB43"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:18)  There is a textual problem here involving <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uJmw'n</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jumwn</FONT>). Most witnesses add <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uJmw'n</FONT> after <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kardiva"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kardias</FONT>), though it is clearly implied in the shorter (Alexandrian) reading (found in <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>46 B 33 1739 1881 <i>et pauci</i>). The longer reading thus looks to be a clarifying gloss, as is frequently found in the Byzantine and Western traditions.<br>
 <b>tn</b> (1:18)  <i>Grk</i> "the." <br>
 <a name="fn44" href="eph.htm#fnB44"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:18)  The perfect participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pefwtismevnou"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">pefwtismenou"</FONT>) may either be part of the prayer ("that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened") or part of the basis of the prayer ("since the eyes of your heart have been enlightened"). Although the participle follows the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{Jna</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jina</FONT>) of v. 17, it is awkward grammatically in the clause. Further, perfect adverbial participles are usually causal in NT Greek. Finally, the context both here and throughout Ephesians seems to emphasize the motif of light as a property belonging to believers. Thus, it seems that Paul is saying, "I know that you are saved, that you have had the blinders of the devil removed; because of this, I can now pray that you will fully understand and see the light of God's glorious revelation." Hence, the translation takes the participle to form a part of the basis for the prayer.<br>
 <a name="fn45" href="eph.htm#fnB45"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:18)  "the hope to which he has called you."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:18)  <i>The hope of his calling. </i>The translation is more formally equivalent for this and the following two phrases, because of the apparently intentional literary force of the original. There is a natural cadence to the three genitive expressions (<i>hope <b>of</b> his calling</i>, <i>wealth <b>of</b> his glorious inheritance</i>, and <i>extraordinary greatness <b>of</b> his power</i>). The essence of Paul's prayer is seen here. Paraphrased it reads as follows: "Since you are enlightened by God's Spirit, I pray that you may comprehend the hope to which he has called you, the spiritual riches that await the saints in glory, and the spiritual power that is available to the saints now." Thus, the prayer focuses on all three temporal aspects of our salvation as these are embedded in the genitives--the past (<i>calling</i>), the future (<i>inheritance</i>), and the present (<i>power toward us who believe</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn46" href="eph.htm#fnB46"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:18)  <i>Grk</i> "of the glory of his." "Of the glory" is taken as an attributive genitive and is thus translated as an adjective.<br>
 <a name="fn47" href="eph.htm#fnB47"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:19)  Or "immeasurable, surpassing"<br>
 <a name="fn48" href="eph.htm#fnB48"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:19)  Or "for, to"<br>
 <a name="fn49" href="eph.htm#fnB49"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:19)  <i>Grk</i> "according to."<br>

 <b>sn</b> (1:19)  What is translated as <i>exercise</i> is a term used only of supernatural power in the NT, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejnevrgeia</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">energeia</FONT>). <br>
 <a name="fn51" href="eph.htm#fnB51"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:20)  <i>Grk</i> "which" (v. 20 is a subordinate clause to v. 19).<br>
 <a name="fn52" href="eph.htm#fnB52"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:20) <i> </i>The verb "exercised" (the aorist of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejnergevw</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">energew</FONT>) has its nominal cognate in "exercise" in v. 19 (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejnevrgeia</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">energeia</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn53" href="eph.htm#fnB53"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:20)  The Western and Byzantine texttypes have the indicative <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejkavqisen</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ekaqisen</FONT>, "he seated") for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaqivsa" </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kaqisa"</FONT>, "when he seated, by seating"). The indicative is thus coordinate with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejnhvrghsen</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">enhrghsen</FONT>, "he raised") and provides an additional statement to "he exercised his power." The participle, on the other hand, is coordinate with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejgeivra"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">egeiras</FONT>) and as such provides evidence of God's power: he exercised his power <i>by</i> raising Christ from the dead and <i>by</i> seating him at his right hand. As intriguing as the indicative reading is, it is most likely an intentional alteration of the original wording, accomplished by an early "Western" scribe. The Byzantine text was simply influenced by the Western at this juncture, and has no separate voice in the matter.<br>
 <a name="fn54" href="eph.htm#fnB54"><sup>55</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:20)  <i>Eph 1:19-20. </i>The point made in these verses is that the power required to live a life pleasing to God is the same power that raised Christ from the dead. For a similar thought, cf. John 15:1-11.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (1:23) <i> </i>The idea of <i>all in all</i> is either related to the universe (hence, he fills the whole universe entirely) or the church universal (hence, Christ fills the church entirely with his presence and power).<br>

To get around this, some have suggested that the genitive for <i>spirit</i> is a genitive of apposition. However, the semantics of the genitive of apposition are against such an interpretation (cf.

The genitive construction<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek"> pivstew" aujtou'</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">pistew" autou</FONT>) is taken as a subjective genitive ("his faithfulness") rather than an objective genitive ("faith in him").

The relative pronoun "<i>which</i>" is attracted to the predicate nominative "<i>glory</i>" in its gender and number (feminine singular), making the antecedent ambiguous. Paul's suffering for them could be viewed as their glory (cf. Col 1:24 for a parallel) in that his suffering has brought about their salvation, but if so his suffering must be viewed as more than his present imprisonment in Rome; it would be a general description of his ministry overall (cf. 2 Cor 11:23-27). The other option is that Paul is implicitly arguing that the believers have <i>continued</i> to have courage in the midst of his trials (as <i>not to lose heart</i> suggests) and that this is their glory. Philippians 1:27-28 offers an interesting parallel: the believers' courage in the face of adversity is a sign of their salvation.<br>

Of these interpretations, the last two are the most plausible. Associations from Wisdom literature favor that interpretation, but the immediate context favors the love of Christ.

 <a name="fn147" href="eph.htm#fnB147"><sup>8</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:9)  The phrase <i>the lower parts of the earth</i> has been variously interpreted: (1) The traditional view understands this as a reference to the underworld (hell), where Jesus is thought to have descended in the three days between his death and resurrection. In this case, <i>of the earth</i> would be a partitive genitive. (2) A second option is to translate the phrase <i>to the lower parts, the earth</i>. Many recent scholars hold this view and argue that it is a reference to the incarnation. In this case <i>of the earth</i> would be a genitive of apposition. (3) A third option, which also sees the phrase <i>of the earth</i> as a genitive of apposition, is that the descent in the passage occurs <i>after</i> the ascent rather than before it, and refers to the descent of the Spirit at Pentecost (cf. Acts 4:11-16). Support for this latter view is found in the intertestamental and rabbinic use of Ps 68:18 (quoted in v. 8), which is consistently and solely interpreted as a reference to Moses' ascent of Mt. Sinai to "capture" the words of the law. The probability, therefore, is that Paul's comments here reflect a polemic against the interpretation of this passage in certain circles as a reference to Moses. See W. H. Harris, <i>The Descent of Christ</i>.<br>

 <a name="fn150" href="eph.htm#fnB150"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:11)  Some interpreters have understood the phrase <i>pastors and teachers</i> to refer to one and the same group. This would mean that all pastors are teachers and that all teachers are pastors. This position is often taken because it is recognized that both nouns (i.e., <i>pastors</i> and <i>teachers</i>) are governed by one article in Greek. But because the nouns are plural, it is extremely unlikely that they refer to the same group, but only that the apostle Paul is linking them closely together. It is better to regard the pastors as a subset of teachers. In other words, all pastors are teachers, but not all teachers are pastors. See D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax</i>, 284.<br>

The problem in translation is that one cannot be absolutely certain whether they go back to indicatives in the original statement (i.e., "you have put off") or imperatives (i.e., "put off!"). Every other occurrence of an aorist infinitive in indirect discourse in the NT goes back to an imperative, but in all of these examples the indirect discourse is introduced by a verb that implies a command. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">didavskw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">didaskw</FONT>) in Paul may be used to relate the indicatives of the faith as well as the imperatives. This translation implies that the infinitives go back to imperatives, though the alternate view that they refer back to indicatives is also a plausible interpretation. For further discussion, see D.

Wallace, "<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">*Orgivzesqe </FONT>in Ephesians 4:26: Command or Condition?" <i>CTR</i> 3 [1989]: 352-72). The idea of vv. 26-27 is as follows: Christians are to exercise a righteous indignation over sin in the midst of the believing community (v. 26a; note that v. 25 is restricting the discussion to those in the body of Christ). When other believers sin, such people should be gently and quickly confronted (v. 26b), for if the body of Christ does not address sin in its midst, the devil gains a foothold (v. 27). "Entirely opposite of the `introspective conscience' view, this text seems to be a shorthand expression for church discipline, suggesting that there is a biblical warrant for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dikaiva ojrghv</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">dikaia orgh</FONT>] (as the Greeks put it)--righteous indignation" (D.

The notion of "cause of your anger" is both lexically and historically justified. The apparently proverbial nature of the statement ("Do not let the sun go down on the cause of your anger") finds several remarkable parallels in <i>Pss.

(9) In secret places underground their iniquities (were committed) to provoke (Him) to anger" (R. H. Charles' translation).

Although most today regard <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">fwtov"</FONT> as obviously original (UBS4 gives it an "A" rating), a case could be made that <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pneuvmato"</FONT> is what the apostle wrote. First, although this is largely a Byzantine reading (D<sup>2</sup> often, if not normally, assimilates to the Byzantine text), <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>46 gives the reading much greater credibility. Internally, the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">fwtov"</FONT> at the end of v. 8 could have lined up above the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pneuvmato"</FONT> in v. 9 in a scribe's exemplar, thus occasioning dittography. (It is interesting to note that in both <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>49 the two instances of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">fwtov"</FONT> line up.) However, written in a contracted form, as a <i>nomen sacrum</i> (<FONT FACE="GREEK UNCIALS">pn=s</FONT>)--a practice found even in the earliest MSS--<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pneuvmato"</FONT> would not have been easily confused with <FONT FACE="GREEK UNCIALS">fwtos </FONT>(there being only the last letter to occasion homoioteleuton rather than the last three).

In addition, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pneuvmato"</FONT> can be readily explained as harking back to Gal 5:22 ("the fruit of the Spirit").

These terms are used broadly to refer to the genre of writing, not to the content.

T. O'Brien, <i>Philippians </i>[NIGTC], 188-9). Classifying a passage as hymnic or poetic is important because understanding this genre can provide keys to interpretation. However, not all scholars agree that the above criteria are present in this passage, so the decision to typeset it as poetry should be viewed as a tentative decision about its genre.<br>

 <a name="fn194" href="eph.htm#fnB194"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tc</b> (5:17)  The best witnesses read the imperative here (so <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>46<sup> </sup>A B P 0278 6 33 365 1739 <i>et pauci</i>). The participle is found primarily in the Western and Byzantine texttypes (D<sup>2 </sup><FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Y</FONT> 1881 latt <i>et alii </i>[D* F G are slightly different, but support the participial reading]). But the participle is superior on internal grounds; the structure of v. 17 almost requires an imperative after <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajllav</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">alla</FONT>), for this gives balance to the clause: "Do not become foolish, <i>but</i> understand..." If the participle is original, it may be imperatival (and thus should be translated just like an imperative), but such is quite rare in the NT. More likely, there is an implied imperative as follows: "Do not become foolish, but <i>become wise</i>, understanding what the will of the Lord is." Either way, the participle is the harder reading and ought therefore to be considered original. It is significant that seeing an implied imperative in this verse affords a certain symmetry to the apostle's thought in vv. 15-21: there are three main sections (vv. 15-16, v. 17, vv. 18-21), each of which provides a negative injunction, followed by a positive injunction, followed by a present adverbial participle. If <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">sunivete</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">suniete</FONT>) is original, this symmetry is lost. Thus, even though the external evidence for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">sunievnte"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">sunientes</FONT>) is not nearly as weighty as for the imperative, both the transcriptional and intrinsic evidence strongly support it. <br>

D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax, </i>375, says, "There are no other examples in biblical Greek in which <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn </FONT>+ the dative after <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">plhrovw </FONT>indicates content. Further, the parallel with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oi[nw/ </FONT>as well as the common grammatical category of <i>means </i>suggest that the idea intended is that believers are to be filled <i>by means of</i> the [Holy] Spirit. If so there seems to be an unnamed agent. The meaning of this text can only be fully appreciated in light of the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">plhrovw </FONT>language in Ephesians. Always the term is used in connection with a member of the Trinity. Three considerations seem to be key: (1) In Eph 3:19 the `hinge' prayer introducing the last half of the letter makes a request that the believers `be filled with all the fullness of God' (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">plhrwqh'te eij" pa'n plhvrwma tou' qeou'</FONT>). The explicit <i>content</i> of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">plhrovw </FONT>is thus God's fullness (probably a reference to his moral attributes). (2) In 4:10 Christ is said to be the agent of filling (with v. 11 adding the specifics of his giving spiritual gifts). (3) The author then brings his argument to a crescendo in 5:18: Believers are to be filled <i>by </i>Christ <i>by means of </i>the Spirit <i>with </i>the content of the fullness of God."<br>

In 5:19-21 there follows five participles: (1) speaking; (2) singing; (3) making music; (4) giving thanks; (5) submitting. These participles have been variously interpreted, but perhaps the two most likely interpretations are (1) the participles indicate the <i>means </i>by which one is filled by the Spirit; (2) the participles indicate the <i>result</i> of being filled by the Spirit. The fact that the participles are present tense and follow the command (i.e., "be filled") would tend to support both of these options. But it seems out of Paul's character to reduce the filling of the Spirit to a formula of some kind. To the extent that this is true, it is unlikely then that Paul is here stating the <i>means</i> for being filled by the Spirit. Because it is in keeping with Paul's theology and has good grammatical support, it is better to take the participles as indicating certain results of being filled by the Spirit. See D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax, </i>639.<br>
 <a name="fn202" href="eph.htm#fnB202"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:22)  Many scholars regard Eph 5:21 as the verse which introduces this section, rather than 5:22. This is due in part to the lack of a main verb in this verse (see <b>tc</b> (5:22)  note which follows). This connection is not likely, however, because it requires the participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uJpotassovmenoi</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jupotassomenoi</FONT>, "submitting") in 5:21 to act as the main verb of the section, and this participle more likely is linked to the command "be filled by the Spirit" in 5:18 as a participle of result (see <b>sn</b> (5:22)  above). In any case, 5:21 does form a strong link between 5:18-21 and what follows, so the paragraph division which has been placed between 5:21 and 22 should not be viewed as a complete break in Paul's thought.<br>

The text virtually begs for one of these two verb forms, but Paul's often cryptic style argues for the shorter reading. The chronology of development seems to have been: <i>no verb</i>--third person imperative--second person imperative. It is not insignificant that early lectionaries began a new day's reading with v. 22; these most likely caused copyists to add the verb at this juncture. <br>

This is a (slightly modified) quotation from Gen 2:23a (LXX). The Alexandrian text is solidly behind the shorter reading (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>46 <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT>* A B 33 81 1739 1881). Although it is possible that an early scribe's eye skipped over the final <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aujtou'</FONT>, there is a much greater likelihood that a scribe added the Genesis quotation in order to fill out and make explicit Paul's incomplete reference to Gen 2:23. Further, on intrinsic grounds, it seems unlikely that Paul would refer to the physical nature of creation when speaking of the "body of Christ" which is spiritual or mystical. Hence, as is often the case with OT quotations, the scribal clarification missed the point Paul was making; the shorter reading stands as original.<br>

BAGD notes that "`servant' for `slave' is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times...in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished" (BAGD 205 s.v.). The most accurate translation is "bondservant" (sometimes found in the ASV for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dou'lo"</FONT>), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another.

In this entire section Paul is painting a metaphor for his readers based on the attire of a Roman soldier prepared for battle and its similarity to the Christian prepared to do battle against spiritually evil forces. Behind the expression "<i>with truth</i>" is probably the genitive idea "belt of truth." Since this is an appositional genitive, (i.e., belt <i>which is </i>truth) Paul simply left unsaid the idea of the belt and mentioned only his real focus, namely, the <i>truth</i>. (The analogy would have been completely understandable to his 1st century readers.) The idea of the belt is supplied in the translation to clarify the sense in English. <br>

Before a battle in which flaming arrows might be shot at them, the soldiers wet the leather covering with water to extinguish the arrows. The Roman legionaries could close ranks with these shields, the first row holding theirs edge to edge in front, and the rows behind holding the shields above their heads. In this formation they were practically invulnerable to arrows, rocks, and even spears.<br>
