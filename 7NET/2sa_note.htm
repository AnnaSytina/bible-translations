 <b>sn</b> (1:1)  This chapter is closely linked to 1 Sam 31. It should be kept in mind that 1 and 2 Samuel were originally a single book, not separate volumes. Whereas in English Bible tradition the books of Samuel, Kings, Chronicles, and Ezra-Nehemiah are each regarded as two separate books, this was not the practice in ancient Hebrew tradition. Early canonical records, for example, counted them as single books respectively. The division into two books goes back to the Greek translation of the OT and was probably initiated because of the cumbersome length of copies due to the Greek practice (unlike that of Hebrew) of writing vowels. The present division into two books can be a little misleading in terms of perceiving the progression of the argument of the book; in some ways it is preferable to treat the books of 1-2 Samuel in a unified fashion.<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="2sa.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:1)  The <i>Amalekites</i> were a nomadic people who inhabited Judah and the Transjordan. They are mentioned in Gen 36:15-16 as descendants of Amalek who in turn descended from Esau. In Exod 17:8-16 they are described as having acted in a hostile fashion toward Israel as the Israelites traveled to Canaan from Egypt. In David's time the Amalekites were viewed as dangerous enemies who raided, looted, and burned Israelite cities (see 1 Sam 30).<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="2sa.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:1)  <i>Ziklag</i> was a city in the Negev which had been given to David by Achish king of Gath. For more than a year David used it as a base from which he conducted military expeditions (see 1 Sam 27:5-12). According to 1 Sam 30:1-19, Ziklag was destroyed by the Amalekites while Saul fought the Philistines.<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="2sa.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:2)  Tearing one's clothing and throwing dirt on one's head were outward expressions of grief in the ancient Near East, where such demonstrable reactions were a common response to tragic news.<br>
 <a name="fn4" href="2sa.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  <i>Heb</i> "he"; the referent (the man mentioned at the beginning of v. 2) has been specified in the translation to avoid confusion as to who fell to the ground.<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="2sa.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  <i>Heb </i>"he fell to the ground and did obeisance." <br>
 <a name="fn6" href="2sa.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  <i>Heb </i>"What was the word?"<br>
 <a name="fn7" href="2sa.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  <i>Heb </i>"from the people."<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="2sa.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  <i>Heb </i>"fell and died."<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="2sa.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  In v. 2 he is called simply a "man." The word used here in v. 5 (so also in vv. 6, 13, 15), though usually referring to a young man or servant, may in this context designate a "fighting" man, i.e., a soldier.<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="2sa.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:5)  Instead of the MT "who was recounting this to him, `How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?'" the Syriac Peshitta reads "declare to me how Saul and his son Jonathan died."<br>
 <a name="fn11" href="2sa.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:6)  The Syriac Peshitta and one MS of the LXX lack the words "who was telling him this" of the MT.<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="2sa.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:8)  The present translation reads with the Qere and<i> </i>many medieval Hebrew MSS "and I said," rather than the Kethib which has "and he said." See the LXX, Syriac Peshitta, and Vulgate, all of which have the first person.<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="2sa.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  As McCarter points out, the Polel of the verb <i>mut</i> ("to die") "refers to dispatching or `finishing off' someone already wounded and near death." (See McCarter, <i>II Samuel</i>, 59.)<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="2sa.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  <i>Heb </i>"the dizziness has seized me." On the meaning of the Hebrew noun translated "dizziness," see McCarter, <i>II Samuel</i>, 59-60. The point seems to be that he is unable to kill himself because he is weak and disoriented.<br>
 <a name="fn15" href="2sa.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  The Hebrew text here is grammatically very awkward (<i>Heb </i>"because all still my life in me"). Whether the broken construct phrase is due to the fact that the alleged speaker is in a confused state of mind as he is on the verge of dying, or whether the MT has sustained corruption in the transmission process, is not entirely clear. The former seems likely, although McCarter understands the MT to be the result of conflation of two shorter forms of text (see <i>II Samuel</i>, 57, n. 9). Early translators also struggled with the verse, apparently choosing to leave part of the Hebrew text untranslated. For example, the Lucianic recension of the LXX lacks "all," while other witnesses (namely, one medieval Hebrew MS, codices A and B of the LXX, and the Syriac Peshitta) lack "still."<br>
 <a name="fn16" href="2sa.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  <i>Heb </i>"after his falling."<br>
 <a name="fn17" href="2sa.htm#fnB17"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:10)  The MT lacks the definite article, but this is likely due to textual corruption. It is preferable to read the <i>alef</i> of `<i>s&#180;dh</i> as a <i>he</i>' (<i>hs&#180;dh</i>). There is no reason to think that the soldier confiscated from Saul's dead body only one of two or more bracelets that he was wearing. <br>
 <a name="fn18" href="2sa.htm#fnB18"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:10)  The claims that the soldier is making here seem at variance with the story of Saul's death as presented in 1 Sam 31:3-5. In that passage it appears that Saul took his own life, not that he was slain by a passerby who happened on the scene. Some scholars account for the discrepancy by supposing that conflicting accounts have been brought together in the MT. However, it is likely that the young man is here fabricating the account in a self-serving way so as to gain favor with David, or so he supposes. He probably had come across Saul's corpse, stolen the crown and bracelet from the body, and now hopes to curry favor with David by handing over to him these emblems of Saul's royalty. But in so doing the Amalekite greatly miscalculated David's response to this alleged participation in Saul's death. The consequence of his lies will instead be his own death!<br>
 <a name="fn19" href="2sa.htm#fnB19"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:11)  The present translation follows the Qere and many medieval Hebrew MSS in reading "his garments," rather than "his garment," the reading of the Kethib.<br>
 <a name="fn20" href="2sa.htm#fnB20"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13)  The Hebrew word used here refers to a foreigner whose social standing was something less than that of native residents of the land, but something more than that of a non-resident alien who was merely passing through.<br>
 <a name="fn21" href="2sa.htm#fnB21"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:15)  <i>Heb </i>"young men."<br>
 <a name="fn22" href="2sa.htm#fnB22"><sup>23</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:18)  The reference to "<i>The Bow</i>" is very difficult here. Some interpreters (e.g., S. R. Driver, P. K. McCarter, Jr.) suggest deleting the word from the text, but there does not seem to be sufficient evidence for doing so. Others (cf. KJV) understand the reference to be elliptical, meaning "<i>the use of </i>the bow." The verse would then imply that with the deaths of Saul and Jonathan having occurred, a period of trying warfare is about to begin, requiring adequate preparation for war on the part of the younger generation. Various other views may also be found in the secondary literature. However, it seems best to understand the word here to be a reference to the name of a song (i.e., "The Bow"), most likely the poem that follows in vv. 19-27.<br>
 <a name="fn23" href="2sa.htm#fnB23"><sup>24</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:18)  The <i>Book of Yashar</i> is a non-canonical writing no longer in existence. It is referred to here and in Josh 10:12-13 and 1 Kgs 8:12-13. It apparently was "a collection of ancient national poetry" (so BDB 449). <br>
 <a name="fn24" href="2sa.htm#fnB24"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:19)  The word <i>beauty</i> is used figuratively here to refer to Saul and Jonathan.<br>
 <a name="fn25" href="2sa.htm#fnB25"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:20)  The cities of <i>Gath</i> and <i>Ashkelon</i> are mentioned here by synecdoche of part for the whole. As major Philistine cities they in fact represent all of Philistia. The point is that when the sad news of fallen Israelite leadership reaches the Philistines, it will be for these enemies of Israel the occasion of great joy rather than grief.<br>
 <a name="fn26" href="2sa.htm#fnB26"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:21)  Instead of the MT's "fields of grain offerings" the Lucianic recension of the LXX reads "your high places are mountains of death." Cf. the Old Latin <i>montes mortis</i> ("mountains of death")<i>.</i><br>
 <a name="fn27" href="2sa.htm#fnB27"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:21)  This is the only biblical occurrence of the Niphal of the verb <i>g&#180;l</i>. This verb usually has the sense of "to abhor" or "loathe." But here it seems to refer to the now dirty and unprotected condition of a previously well-maintained instrument of battle.<br>
 <a name="fn28" href="2sa.htm#fnB28"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:21)  It is preferable to read here Hebrew <i>masuah</i>, with many Hebrew MSS, rather than <i>masiah</i> of the MT. Although the Syriac Peshitta understands the statement to pertain to Saul, the point here is not that <i>Saul</i> is not anointed. Rather, it is <i>the shield</i> of Saul that lies discarded and is no longer anointed. In ancient Near Eastern practice a warrior's shield that was in normal use would have to be anointed regularly in order to ensure that the leather did not become dry and brittle. Like other warriors of his day Saul would have carefully maintained his tools of trade. But now that he is dead, the once-cared-for shield of the mighty warrior lies sadly discarded and woefully neglected, a silent but eloquent commentary on how different things are now compared to the way they were during Saul's lifetime.<br>
 <a name="fn29" href="2sa.htm#fnB29"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:22)  The Hebrew imperfect verbal form is used here to indicate repeated past action.<br>
 <a name="fn30" href="2sa.htm#fnB30"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:23)  <i>Heb </i>"beloved and dear."<br>
 <a name="fn31" href="2sa.htm#fnB31"><sup>32</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:24)  Clothing of <i>scarlet </i>was expensive and beyond the financial reach of most people.<br>
 <a name="fn32" href="2sa.htm#fnB32"><sup>33</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:27)  The expression <i>weapons of war</i> may here be a figurative way of referring to Saul and Jonathan.<br>
 <a name="fn33" href="2sa.htm#fnB33"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:1)  <i>Heb</i> "he said." The referent (the LORD) has been specified in the translation for clarity and for stylistic reasons.<br>
 <a name="fn34" href="2sa.htm#fnB34"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tc</b> (2:3)  The expression "the cities of Hebron" is odd; we would expect the noun to be in the singular, if used at all. Although the Syriac Peshitta has the expected reading "in Hebron," the MT is clearly the more difficult reading and should probably be retained here.<br>
 <a name="fn35" href="2sa.htm#fnB35"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  <i>Heb </i>"house."<br>
 <a name="fn36" href="2sa.htm#fnB36"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  <i>Heb </i>"and they told David." The subject appears to be indefinite, allowing one to translate the verb as passive with David as subject.<br>
 <a name="fn37" href="2sa.htm#fnB37"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  <i>Heb </i>"men."<br>
 <a name="fn38" href="2sa.htm#fnB38"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:5)  Or<i> </i>"loyalty."<br>
 <a name="fn39" href="2sa.htm#fnB39"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6)  Or<i> </i>"loyalty and devotion."<br>
 <a name="fn40" href="2sa.htm#fnB40"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6)  <i>Heb </i>"will do with you this good."<br>
 <a name="fn41" href="2sa.htm#fnB41"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:7)  <i>Heb </i>"let your hands be strong."<br>
 <a name="fn42" href="2sa.htm#fnB42"><sup>10</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:8)  The name <i>Ish-bosheth</i> means in Hebrew "man of shame." It presupposes an earlier form such as Ish-baal ("man of the Lord"), with the word "baal" being used of Israel's God. But because the Canaanite storm god was named "Baal," that part of the name was later replaced with the word "shame." <br>
 <a name="fn43" href="2sa.htm#fnB43"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tc</b> (2:9)  The MT here reads "the Ashurite," but this is problematic if it is taken to mean "the Assyrian." Ish-bosheth's kingdom obviously was not of such proportions as to extend to Assyria. The Syriac Peshitta renders the word as "the Geshurite," while the Targum has "of the house of Ashur." We should probably emend the Hebrew text to read "the Geshurite." The Geshurites lived in the northeastern part of the land of Palestine.<br>
 <a name="fn44" href="2sa.htm#fnB44"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:10)  <i>Heb </i>"house."<br>
 <a name="fn45" href="2sa.htm#fnB45"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:11)  <i>Heb </i>"And the number of the days in which David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months."<br>
 <a name="fn46" href="2sa.htm#fnB46"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:14)  <i>Heb </i>"play." What is in view here is a gladiatorial contest in which representative groups of soldiers engage in mortal combat before the watching armies. <br>
 <a name="fn47" href="2sa.htm#fnB47"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:14)  <i>Heb </i>"let them arise."<br>
 <a name="fn48" href="2sa.htm#fnB48"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:16)  <i>Heb </i>"and they grabbed each one the head of his neighbor with his sword in the side of his neighbor and they fell together."<br>
 <a name="fn49" href="2sa.htm#fnB49"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:17)  <i>Heb </i>"servants." So also elsewhere.<br>
 <a name="fn50" href="2sa.htm#fnB50"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:21)  <i>Heb </i>"young men." So also elsewhere.<br>

 <a name="fn52" href="2sa.htm#fnB52"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:22)  <i>Heb </i>"lift."<br>
 <a name="fn53" href="2sa.htm#fnB53"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:23)  <i>Heb </i>"the." The article functions here as a possessive pronoun.<br>
 <a name="fn54" href="2sa.htm#fnB54"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:23)  <i>Heb </i>"and they stand."<br>
 <a name="fn55" href="2sa.htm#fnB55"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:25)  <i>Heb </i>"were gathered together."<br>
 <a name="fn56" href="2sa.htm#fnB56"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:27)  The Hebrew verb (<i>na&#180;alah</i>) used here is the Niphal perfect 3ms of <i>&#180;lh</i> ("to go up"). In the Niphal this verb "is used idiomatically, of getting away from so as to abandon...especially of an army raising a siege..." (see S. R. Driver, <i>Notes on the Hebrew Text and the Topography of the Books of Samuel</i>, 244).<br>
 <a name="fn57" href="2sa.htm#fnB57"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:28)  <i>Heb </i>"stood."<br>
 <a name="fn58" href="2sa.htm#fnB58"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:28)  <i>Heb </i>"they no longer chased after Israel and they no longer fought."<br>
 <a name="fn59" href="2sa.htm#fnB59"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:29)  The word "River" is not in the Hebrew text, but is supplied in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn60" href="2sa.htm#fnB60"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:29)  <i>Heb </i>"and they went, all the Bitron." The meaning of the Hebrew word<i> </i>"Bitron," which is used only here in the OT, is disputed. The translation above follows BDB in taking the word to be a proper name of an area east of the Jordan. A different understanding was advocated by W. R. Arnold, who took the word to refer to the forenoon or morning; a number of modern scholars and translations have adopted this view (cf. NAB, NASB, NRSV, NLT). See W. R. Arnold, "The Meaning of <i>btrwn</i>," <i>AJSL</i> 28 (1911-12): 274-83. In this case one might translate<i> </i>"and they traveled all morning long."<br>
 <a name="fn61" href="2sa.htm#fnB61"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:3)  The Hebrew text does not have the word "son." So also in vv. 3-5.<br>
 <a name="fn62" href="2sa.htm#fnB62"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:3)  <i>Heb </i>"wife."<br>
 <a name="fn63" href="2sa.htm#fnB63"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:5)  The Hebrew text does not have "sons."<br>
 <a name="fn64" href="2sa.htm#fnB64"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:6)  <i>Heb </i>"was strengthening himself." The statement may have a negative sense here, perhaps suggesting that Abner was overstepping the bounds of political propriety in a self-serving way.<br>
 <a name="fn65" href="2sa.htm#fnB65"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tc</b> (3:7)  The Hebrew of the MT reads simply "and he said," with no expressed subject for the verb. It is not likely that the text originally had no expressed subject for this verb, since the antecedent is not immediately clear from the context. We should probably restore to the Hebrew text the name "Ish-bosheth." See a few medieval Hebrew MSS, Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion, and Vulgate. Perhaps the name was accidentally omitted by homoioarcton. Note that both the name Ishbosheth and the following preposition<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl"> </FONT><FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la</FONT> begin with the letter <i>alef</i>. <br>
 <a name="fn66" href="2sa.htm#fnB66"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:7)  <i>Heb </i>"come to."<br>
 <a name="fn67" href="2sa.htm#fnB67"><sup>7</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:7)  This accusation against Abner is a very serious one, since an act of sexual infringement on the king's harem would probably have been understood as a blatant declaration of aspirations to kingship. As such it was not merely a matter of ethical impropriety but an act of grave political significance as well.<br>
 <a name="fn68" href="2sa.htm#fnB68"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:8)  <i>Heb </i>"I do."<br>
 <a name="fn69" href="2sa.htm#fnB69"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:8)  <i>Heb </i>"brothers."<br>

 <a name="fn71" href="2sa.htm#fnB71"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:9)  <i>Heb </i>"So will God do to Abner and so he will add to him."<br>
 <a name="fn72" href="2sa.htm#fnB72"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tc</b> (3:9) <i> Heb </i>"has sworn to David." The LXX, with the exception of the recension of Origen, adds "in this day."<br>
 <a name="fn73" href="2sa.htm#fnB73"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:11)  <i>Heb </i>"he"; the referent (Ish-bosheth) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>

 <a name="fn77" href="2sa.htm#fnB77"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:13)  The words "when you come to see my face," though found in the Hebrew text, are somewhat redundant given the similar expression in the earlier part of the verse. The words are absent from the Syriac Peshitta.<br>
 <a name="fn78" href="2sa.htm#fnB78"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:14)  <i>Heb</i> "to Ish-bosheth son of Saul saying." To avoid excessive sibilance (especially when read aloud) the translation renders "saying" as "with this demand."<br>

 <a name="fn85" href="2sa.htm#fnB85"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tc</b> (3:18)  The present translation follows the LXX, the Syriac Peshitta, and Vulgate in reading "I will save," rather than the MT "he saved." The context calls for the 1cs imperfect of the verb rather than the 3ms perfect.<br>

 <a name="fn101" href="2sa.htm#fnB101"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:29)  The expression used here is difficult. The translation "one who works at the spindle" follows a suggestion of S. R. Driver that the expression pejoratively describes an effeminate man who, rather than being a mighty warrior, is occupied with tasks that are normally fulfilled by women (see S. R. Driver, <i>Notes on the Hebrew Text and the Topography of the Books of Samuel</i>, 250-51). But McCarter, following an alleged Phoenician usage of the noun to refer to "crutches," adopts a different view. He translates the phrase "clings to a crutch," seeing here a further description of physical lameness (see P. K. McCarter, Jr., <i>II Samuel</i>, 118). Such an idea fits the present context well and is followed by NIV and NLT, although the evidence for this meaning is questionable. According to <i>DNWSI</i> (2:915-16), the noun consistently refers to a spindle in Phoenician, as it does in Ugaritic (see C. H. Gordon, <i>UT</i> 468).<br>

The Vulgate lacks "in all Edom"; most of the Greek tradition (with the exception of the Lucianic recension and the recension of Origen) and the Syriac Peshitta lack "he placed garrisons."

NASB), or that in David's day members of the king's family could function as a special category of "priests." The latter option seems to be the more straightforward way of understanding the word in 2 Sam 8:18. On the other hand, the parallel passage in 1 Chr 18:17 has "the king's leading officials."<br>

The ancient versions are not unanimous in the way that they render the phrase.

However, Exod 22:1 [21:37 HT] specifies fourfold repayment for a stolen sheep, which is consistent with 2 Sam 12:6.

This is one of the so-called <i>tiqqune sopherim</i>, or "emendations of the scribes." According to this ancient tradition, the scribes changed the text in order to soften somewhat the negative light in which David was presented. If that be the case, the MT reflects the altered text. The present translation departs from the MT here. Elsewhere the Piel stem of this verb means "treat with contempt," but never "cause someone to treat with contempt."<br>
 <a name="fn376" href="2sa.htm#fnB376"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:15)  <i>Heb </i>"and the LORD struck the child...and he was ill." It is necessary to repeat "the child" in the translation to make clear who became ill, since "the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife had borne to David, and he became very ill" could be understood to mean that David himself became ill.<br>

While some translations render the pronoun as third person plural ("they"), implying that both David and Bathsheba together named the child, it is likely that the name "Solomon," which is related to the Hebrew word for "peace" (and may be derived from it) had special significance for David, who would have regarded the birth of a second child to Bathsheba as a confirming sign that God had forgiven his sin and was at peace with him.<br>

 <a name="fn414" href="2sa.htm#fnB414"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:18)  The Hebrew expression used here (<i>ketonet passim</i>) is found only here and in Gen 37:3, 23, 32. Hebrew <i>pas</i> can refer to the palm of the hand or the sole of the foot; here the idea is probably that of a long robe reaching to the feet and having sleeves reaching to the wrists. The notion of a "coat of many colors," a familiar translation for the phrase in Genesis, is based primarily on the translation adopted in the LXX (<i>chitona poikilion</i>) and does not have a great deal of support.<br>

 <a name="fn431" href="2sa.htm#fnB431"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tc</b> (13:37)  The Hebrew text leaves the word "David" to be inferred. The Syriac Peshitta and Vulgate add the word "David." Most of the Greek tradition includes the words "King David" here. <br>
 <a name="fn432" href="2sa.htm#fnB432"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tc</b> (13:39)  The translation follows 4QSam<sup><sub>a</sub></sup> in reading <i>ruah hammelek</i> ("the spirit of the king") rather than the MT <i>david hammelek</i> ("David the king"). The understanding reflected in the translation above is that David, though alienated during this time from his son Absalom, still had an abiding love and concern for him. He longed for reconciliation with him. A rather different interpretation of the verse supposes that David's interest in taking military action against Absalom grew slack with the passing of time, and this in turn enabled David's advisers to encourage him toward reconciliation with Absalom. For the latter view, see McCarter, <i>II Samuel</i>, 344.<br>

The fact that the Greek translators were working with an unvocalized Hebrew text (i.e., consonants only) made them very susceptible to this type of error.<br>

 <a name="fn517" href="2sa.htm#fnB517"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:27)  The Greek tradition understands the Hebrew word as an imperative ("see"). Most Greek MSS have <i>idete</i>; the Lucianic recension has <i>blepe</i>. It could just as well be taken as a question: "Don't you see what is happening?" The present translation takes the word as a question, with the implication that Zadok is a priest and not a prophet (i.e., "seer") and therefore unable to know what the future holds.<br>

As Driver points out, the Hebrew verb <i>higgid</i> ("he related") never uses the accusative for the person to whom something is told (see S. R.

 <a name="fn538" href="2sa.htm#fnB538"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tc</b> (16:12)  The Hebrew text is difficult here. It is probably preferable to read with the LXX, the Syriac Peshitta, and Vulgate <i>be&#180;onyi</i> ("on my affliction") rather than the Kethib of the MT <i>ba&#180;awoni</i> ("on my wrongdoing"). While this Kethib reading is understandable as an objective genitive (i.e., "the wrong perpetrated upon me"), it does not conform to normal Hebrew idiom for this idea. The Qere of the MT (<i>be&#180;ene</i>, "on my eyes"), usually taken as synecdoche to mean "my tears," does not commend itself as a likely meaning. The Hebrew word is one of the so-called <i>tiqqune sopherim</i>, or "emendations of the scribes."<br>

The Syriac Peshitta reads <i>li</i> ("for me"), the Hebrew counterpart of which may also lie behind the LXX rendering <i>moi</i> ("for me").

This figure of speech involves the use of the same word in different senses and is known as antanaclasis.

However, some scholars have suggested moving the <i>athnah</i> to "Judah" a couple of words earlier. This would yield the following sense: "Three days, and you be present here with them." The difference in meaning is slight, and the MT is acceptable as it stands.<br>

We should probably read instead the imperfect. Although it is possible to understand the perfect here as indicating that the feared result is thought of as already having taken place (cf. BDB 815 [a]), it is more likely that the perfect is simply the result of scribal error. In this context the imperfect would be more consistent with the following verb <i>wehissil</i> ("and he will get away").<br>
 <a name="fn671" href="2sa.htm#fnB671"><sup>12</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:8)  The significance of the statement <i>it fell out </i>here is unclear. If the dagger fell out of its sheath before Joab got to Amasa, how then did he kill him? Josephus (<i>Ant</i>.<i> </i>7.284) suggested that as Joab approached Amasa he deliberately caused the dagger to fall to the ground at an opportune moment as though by accident. When he bent over and picked it up, he then stabbed Amasa with it. Others have tried to make a case for thinking that two swords are referred to--the one that fell out and another that Joab kept concealed until the last moment. But nothing in the text clearly supports this view. Perhaps Josephus' understanding is best, but it is by no means obvious in the text either.<br>

Figuratively it can refer to the removal of an individual from a group (e.g., Jer 6:8; Ezek 23:17) or to a type of punishment the specific identity of which is uncertain (e.g., here and Num 25:4). <br>

 <a name="fn722" href="2sa.htm#fnB722"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:16)  This is the only occurrence of this Hebrew word in the OT. Its precise meaning is therefore somewhat uncertain. As early as the LXX the word was understood to refer to a "spear," and this seems to be the most likely possibility. Some scholars have proposed emending the text of 2 Sam 21:16 to <i>qoba&#180;o</i> ("his helmet"), but in spite of the fact that the word "helmet" appears in 1 Sam 17:5, there is not much evidence for reading that word here.<br>
 <a name="fn723" href="2sa.htm#fnB723"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:16)  Either the word "shekels" should be supplied here, or the Hebrew word <i>misqal</i> ("weight") right before "bronze" is a corrupted form of the word for shekel. If the latter is the case the problem probably resulted from another occurrence of the word <i>misqal</i> just four words earlier in the verse.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (21:16)  <i>Three hundred bronze shekels</i> would have weighed about 7.5 pounds (3.4 kg).<br>
 <a name="fn724" href="2sa.htm#fnB724"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:16)  The Hebrew text reads simply "a new [thing]," prompting one to ask "A new <i>what</i>?" Several possibilities have been proposed to resolve the problem: perhaps a word has dropped out of the Hebrew text here; or perhaps the word "new" is the result of misreading a different, less common, word; or perhaps a word (e.g., "sword") is simply to be inferred. The translation generally follows the latter possibility, while at the same time being deliberately non-specific ("weapon").<br>
 <a name="fn725" href="2sa.htm#fnB725"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:19)  <i>Heb </i>"Jaare-Oregim," but the second word, which means "weavers," is probably accidentally included. It appears at the end of the verse. The term is omitted in the parallel account in 1 Chr 20:5, which has simply "Jair."<br>
 <a name="fn726" href="2sa.htm#fnB726"><sup>32</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:19)  The Hebrew text as it stands reads, "Elhanan son of Jaare-Oregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite." Who killed Goliath the Gittite? According to 1 Sam 17:4-58 it was David who killed Goliath, but according to the MT of 2 Sam 21:19 it was Elhanan who killed him. Many scholars believe that the two passages are hopelessly at variance with one another. Others have proposed various solutions to the difficulty, such as identifying David with Elhanan or positing the existence of two Goliaths. But in all likelihood the problem is the result of difficulties in the textual transmission of the Samuel passage; in fact, from a text-critical point of view the books of Samuel are the most poorly preserved of all the books of the Hebrew Bible. The parallel passage in 1 Chr 20:5 reads, "Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath." Both versions are textually corrupt. The Chronicles text has misread "Bethlehemite" (<i>bet hallahmi</i>) as the accusative sign followed by a proper name (`<i>et lahmi</i>). (See the note at 1 Chr 20:5.) The Samuel text misread the word for "brother" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ja</FONT>, `<i>ah</i>) as the accusative sign (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta</FONT>, `<i>et</i>), thereby giving the impression that Elhanan, not David, killed Goliath. Thus in all probability the original text read, "Elhanan son of Jair the Bethlehemite killed the brother of Goliath."<br>

 <b>sn </b> (22:3) Though some see "horn" as referring to a horn-shaped peak of a hill, or to the "horns" of an altar where one could find refuge, it is more likely that the horn of an ox underlies the metaphor (see Deut 33:17; 1 Kgs 22:11; Ps 92:10). The horn of the wild ox is frequently a metaphor for military strength; the idiom "exalt the horn" signifies military victory (see 1 Sam 2:10; Pss 89:17, 24; 92:10; Lam 2:17). In the ancient Near East powerful warrior-kings would sometimes compare themselves to a goring bull that uses its horns to kill its enemies. For examples, see P. Miller, <i>HTR</i> 60 (1967): 422-25, and R. B. Chisholm, <i>Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22</i>, 135-36. 2 Sam 22:3 uses the metaphor of the horn in a slightly different manner. Here the Lord himself is compared to a horn. He is to the psalmist what the horn is to the ox, a source of defense and victory.<br>

It is often associated with rebellion against authority and other crimes that result in societal disorder and anarchy. The phrase "man/son of wickedness" refers to one who opposes God and the order he has established.

 <a name="fn759" href="2sa.htm#fnB759"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:10)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hf*n&#180;</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">n&#180;f*h</FONT>) can carry the sense "[to cause to] bend; [to cause to] bow down" (see <i>HALOT</i>, 693). For example, Gen 49:15 pictures Issachar as a donkey that "bends" its shoulder or back under a burden. Here the LORD causes the sky, pictured as a dome or vault, to sink down as he descends in the storm.<br>

Cherubs, as depicted in the Old Testament, possess both human and animal (lion, ox, and eagle) characteristics (see Ezek 1:10; 10:14, 21; 41:18). They are pictured as winged creatures (Exod 25:20; 37:9; 1 Kgs 6:24-27; Ezek 10:8, 19) and serve as the very throne of God when the ark of the covenant is in view (Pss 80:1; 99:1; see Num 7:89; 1 Sam 4:4; 2 Sam 6:2; 2 Kgs 19:15). The picture of the LORD seated on the cherubs suggests they might be used by him as a vehicle, a function they carry out in Ezek 1:22-28 (the "living creatures" mentioned here are identified as cherubs in Ezek 10:20). In Ps 18:10 the image of a cherub serves to personify the wind (see the next line).<br>

 <a name="fn763" href="2sa.htm#fnB763"><sup>34</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:11)  <i>The wings of the wind.</i> Verse 10 may depict the LORD mounting a cherub, which is in turn propelled by the wind current. Another option is that two different vehicles (a cherub and the wind) are envisioned. A third option is that the wind is personified as a cherub.

The parallel text in Ps 18:11 reads<i> </i>"he made darkness his hiding place around him, his covering."  2 Sam 22:12 omits "his hiding place" and pluralizes "covering."  Ps 18:11 may include a conflation of synonyms ("his hiding place" and "his covering" ) or 2 Sam 22:12 may be the result of haplography/homoioarcton. Note that three successive words in Ps 18:11 begin with the letter <i>samekh</i>: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">otK*s% wyt*obyb!s= ort=s!</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">s!trW s=b!bOt*w s%K*to</FONT>).<br>

A cognate Ugaritic noun means "sieve," and a related verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rvj</FONT> ("to sift") is attested in post-biblical Hebrew and Aramaic (see <i>HALOT</i>, 363). The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;y]m^-tr~v=j^</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">j^v=r^t-m^y]&lt;</FONT>) means literally "a sieve of water."  It pictures the rain clouds as a sieve through which the rain falls to the ground. (See F. M. Cross and D. N. Freedman, <i>Studies in Ancient Yahwistic Poetry</i>, 146, note 33.)<br>

The verbs <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wrb=u*</FONT> (Ps 18:12) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wru&amp;B*</FONT> (2 Sam 22:13) appear to be variants involving a transposition of the first two letters. The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wyb*u*</FONT> ("his clouds"; Ps 18:12) may be virtually dittographic (note the following <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wrb=u*</FONT>), or it could have accidentally dropped from the text of 2 Sam 22:13 by virtual haplography (note the preceding <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wru&amp;B*</FONT>, which might have originally read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wrb=u*</FONT>). The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dr&#180;B*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">B*r*d</FONT>, "hail"; Ps 18:12) may be virtually dittographic (note the preceding <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wrb=u*</FONT>), or it could have dropped from 2 Sam 22:13 by virtual haplography (note the preceding <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wru&amp;B*</FONT>, which might have originally read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wrb=u*</FONT>).

In this poetic narrative context the prefixed verbal form is best understood as a preterite indicating past tense, not an imperfect. Note the preterite form in the preceding line. The text of Ps 18:13 adds at this point, "hail and coals of fire." These words are probably accidentally added from v. 12b; they do not appear in 2 Sam 22:14.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (22:14)  Thunder is a common motif in Old Testament theophanies and in ancient Near Eastern portrayals of the storm god and warring kings. See R. B. Chisholm, <i>Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22</i>, 179-83.<br>

 <a name="fn771" href="2sa.htm#fnB771"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:15)  The pronominal suffixes on the verbs "scattered" and "routed" (see the next line) refer to David's enemies. Some argue that the suffixes refer to the arrows, in which case one might translate "shot them far and wide" and "made them move noisily," respectively. They argue that the enemies have not been mentioned since v. 4 and are not again mentioned until v. 17. However, usage of the verbs <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jwp</FONT> ("scatter") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;mh</FONT> ("rout") elsewhere in Holy War accounts suggests the suffixes refer to enemies. Enemies are frequently pictured in such texts as scattered and/or routed (see Exod 14:24; 23:27; Num 10:35; Josh 10:10; Judg 4:15; 1 Sam 7:10; 11:11; Ps 68:1). <br>

Arrows and lightning bolts are associated in other texts (see Pss 77:17-18; 144:6; Zech 9:14), as well as in ancient Near Eastern art. See R. B. Chisholm, <i>Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22</i>, 187, 190-92.<br>

 <a name="fn775" href="2sa.htm#fnB775"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:16)  The noun is derived from the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rug</FONT>, which is often understood to mean<i> </i>"rebuke." In some cases it is apparent that scolding or threatening is in view (see Gen 37:10; Ruth 2:16; Zech 3:2). However, in militaristic contexts this translation is inadequate, for the verb refers in this setting to the warrior's battle cry, which terrifies and paralyzes the enemy. See <i>TDOT</i> 3:53, and note the use of the verb in Pss 68:30; 106:9; and Nah 1:4, as well as the related noun in Job 26:11; Pss 9:5; 76:6; 104:7; Isa 50:2; 51:20; 66:15.<br>

 <a name="fn778" href="2sa.htm#fnB778"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:17)  <i>Heb </i>"mighty waters." The waters of the sea symbolize the psalmist's powerful enemies, as well as the realm of death they represent (see v. 5 and Ps 144:7).<br>
 <a name="fn779" href="2sa.htm#fnB779"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:18)  The singular refers either to personified death or collectively to the psalmist's enemies. The following line, which refers to "those [plural] who hate me," favors the latter.<br>

As vv. 22-25 make clear, David refers here to his unwavering obedience to God's commands. He explains that the Lord was pleased with him and willing to deliver him because he had been loyal to God and obedient to his commandments. Ancient Near Eastern literature contains numerous parallels. A superior (a god or king) would typically reward a subject (a king or the servant of a king, respectively) for loyalty and obedience. See R. B. Chisholm, <i>Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22</i>, 211-13.<br>
 <a name="fn785" href="2sa.htm#fnB785"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:21)  The unreduced Hiphil prefixed verbal form appears to be an imperfect, in which case the psalmist would be generalizing. However, both the preceding and following contexts (see especially v. 25) suggest he is narrating his experience. Despite its unreduced form, the verb is better taken as a preterite. For other examples of unreduced Hiphil preterites, see Pss 55:14a; 68:9a, 10b; 80:8a; 89:43a; 107:38b; 116:6b.<br>

The phrase "ways of the LORD" refers here to the "conduct required" by the LORD (see <i>HALOT</i>, 232). In Ps 25 the LORD `s "ways" are associated with his covenantal demands (see vv. 4, 9-10). See also Ps 119:3 (cf. vv. 1, 4), as well as Deut 8:6; 10:12; 11:22; 19:9; 26:17; 28:9; 30:16.<br>
 <a name="fn788" href="2sa.htm#fnB788"><sup>59</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:22)  <i>Heb </i>"I have not acted wickedly from my God." The statement is elliptical, the idea being,<i> </i>"I have not acted wickedly and, in so doing, departed from my God."<br>
 <a name="fn789" href="2sa.htm#fnB789"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:23)  <i>Heb </i>"for all his regulations are before me." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wf*P*v=m!</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">m!vP*f*w</FONT>, "his regulations") refers to God's covenantal requirements, especially those which the king is responsible to follow (cf Deut 17:18-20). See also Pss 19:9 (cf vv. 7-8); 89:30; 147:20 (cf v. 19), as well as the numerous uses of the term in Ps 119.<br>
 <a name="fn790" href="2sa.htm#fnB790"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:23)  <i>Heb </i>"and his rules, I do not turn aside from it." Ps 18:22 reads, "and his rules I do not turn aside from me."  The prefixed verbal form is probably an imperfect; David here generalizes about his loyalty to God's commands. The LORD's "rules" are the stipulations of the covenant which the king was responsible to obey (see Ps 89:31; cf v. 30 and Deut 17:18-20).<br>
 <a name="fn791" href="2sa.htm#fnB791"><sup>62</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:24)  <i>Heb </i>"from my sin," that is, from making it my own in any way. Leading a "blameless" life meant that the king would be loyal to God's covenant, purge the government and society of evil and unjust officials, and reward loyalty to the LORD (see Ps 101). <br>
 <a name="fn792" href="2sa.htm#fnB792"><sup>63</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:25)  <i>Heb </i>"according to my righteousness." See v. 21.<br>

 <a name="fn794" href="2sa.htm#fnB794"><sup>65</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:26)  The imperfect verbal forms in vv. 26-30 draw attention to God's characteristic actions. Based on his experience, the psalmist generalizes about God's just dealings with people (vv. 26-28) and about the way in which God typically empowers him on the battlefield (vv. 29-30). The Hitpael stem is used in vv. 26-27 in a reflexive resultative (or causative) sense. God makes himself loyal, etc. in the sense that he conducts or reveals himself as such. On this use of the Hitpael stem, see GKC &#167;54.<i>e</i>.<br>
 <a name="fn795" href="2sa.htm#fnB795"><sup>66</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:26)  Or<i> </i>"to a faithful follower."

See as well the parallel passage in Ps 18:26. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ltp</FONT> is used in only three other texts. In Gen 30:8 it means literally<i> </i>"to wrestle," or "to twist." In Job 5:13 it refers to devious individuals, and in Prov 8:8 to deceptive words.<br>
 <a name="fn800" href="2sa.htm#fnB800"><sup>71</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:27)  The adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vQ@u!</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u!Q}v</FONT>) has the basic nuance "twisted; crooked," and by extension refers to someone or something that is morally perverse. It appears frequently in Proverbs, where it is used of evil people (22:5), speech (8:8; 19:1), thoughts (11:20; 17:20) and life styles (2:15; 28:6). A righteous king opposes such people (Ps 101:4). Verses 26-27 affirm God's justice. He responds to people in accordance with their moral character. His response mirrors their actions. The faithful and blameless find God to be loyal and reliable in his dealings with them. But deceivers discover he is able and willing to use deceit to destroy them. For a more extensive discussion of the theme of divine deception in the OT, see R. B. Chisholm, <i>BSac</i> 155 (1998): 11-28.<br>

For other examples of "lamp" used in this way, see Job 18:6; 21:17; Prov 13:9; 20:20; 24:20. For other examples of "light" as a symbol for life, see Job 3:20; 33:30; Ps 56:13.<br>
 <a name="fn805" href="2sa.htm#fnB805"><sup>76</sup></a><b>tc</b> (22:29)  The Lucianic Greek recension and Vulgate understand this verb to be second person rather than third person as in the MT.

Though one might expect a preposition to follow the verb here, this need not be the case with the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jwr</FONT> (see 1 Sam 17:22).

The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la@h*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">h*a@l</FONT>, "the God") stands as a nominative (or genitive) absolute in apposition to the resumptive pronominal suffix on "way." The prefixed article emphasizes his distinctiveness as the one true God (see BDB 42; Deut 33:26). God's "way" in this context refers to his protective and salvific acts in fulfillment of his promise (see also Deut 32:4; Pss 67:2; 77:13 [note vv. 11-12, 14]; 103:7; 138:5; 145:17).<br>

The LORD's "word" probably refers here to his oracle(s) of victory delivered to the psalmist before the battle(s) described in the following context. See also Pss 12:5-7 and 138:2-3. David frequently received such oracles before going into battle (see 1 Sam 23:2, 4-5, 10-12; 30:8; 2 Sam 5:19). The LORD's word of promise is absolutely reliable; it is compared to metal that has been refined in fire and cleansed of impurities. See Ps 12:6. In the ancient Near East kings would typically seek and receive oracles from their god(s) prior to battle. For examples, see R. B. Chisholm, <i>Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22</i>, 241-42.<br>

In this way the psalmist indicates that the LORD is the only true God and reliable source of protection. See also Deut 32:39, where the LORD affirms that he is the only true God. Note as well the emphasis on his role as protector (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rWx</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">xWr</FONT>],<i> </i>"rocky cliff") in Deut 32:4, 15, 17-18, 30.<br>

The translation follows Ps 18:32 in reading "he made my path smooth." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ym!T*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">T*m!&lt;</FONT>, "smooth") usually carries a moral or ethical connotation, "blameless, innocent."  However, in Ps 18:33 it refers to a pathway free of obstacles. The reality underlying the metaphor is the psalmist's ability to charge into battle without tripping (see vv. 33, 36).<br>
 <a name="fn822" href="2sa.htm#fnB822"><sup>93</sup></a><b>tc</b> (22:34)  <i>Heb</i> "[the one who] makes his feet like [those of] a deer."

 <a name="fn823" href="2sa.htm#fnB823"><sup>94</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:34)  <i>Heb</i> "and on my high places he makes me walk." The imperfect verbal form emphasizes God's characteristic provision. The psalmist compares his agility in battle to the ability of a deer to negotiate rugged, high terrain without falling or being injured. Habakkuk uses similar language to describe his faith during difficult times. See Hab 3:19.<br>

The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tj@n&#180;</FONT> apparently means "to pull back; to bend" here (see <i>HALOT</i>, 692). The bronze bow referred to here was probably laminated with bronze strips, or a purely ceremonial or decorative bow made entirely from bronze. In the latter case the language is hyperbolic, for such a weapon would not be functional in battle.<br>
 <a name="fn827" href="2sa.htm#fnB827"><sup>98</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:36)  Another option is to translate the prefixed verb with <i>vav</i> consecutive with a past tense, "you gave me." Several prefixed verbal forms with <i>vav</i> consecutive also appear in vv. 38-44. The present translation understands this section as a description of what generally happened when the author charged into battle, but another option is to understand the section as narratival and translate accordingly.<br>

 <a name="fn835" href="2sa.htm#fnB835"><sup>106</sup></a><b>tc</b> (22:42)  The translation follows one medieval Hebrew MS and the ancient versions in reading the Piel <i>yesawwe&#180;u</i> ("they cry for help") rather than the Qal of the MT <i>yis&#180;u</i> ("they look about for help").

 <a name="fn837" href="2sa.htm#fnB837"><sup>108</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:42)  The words "they cry out" are not in the Hebrew text. This reference to the psalmists' enemies crying out for help to the LORD suggests that the psalmist refers here to enemies within the covenant community, rather than foreigners. However, the militaristic context suggests foreign enemies are in view. Ancient Near Eastern literature indicates that defeated enemies would sometimes cry out for mercy to the god(s) of their conqueror. See R. B. Chisholm, <i>Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22</i>, 271. <br>

In this context <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">byr]</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">r!b</FONT>, "striving") probably has a militaristic sense (as in Judg 12:2; Isa 41:11), and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;u^</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u^&lt;</FONT>, "people") probably refers more specifically to an army (for other examples, see the verses listed in BDB 766 [2.d]). The suffix "my" suggests David is referring to attacks by his own countrymen, the "people" being Israel. However, the parallel text in Ps 18:43 omits the suffix.<br>
 <a name="fn840" href="2sa.htm#fnB840"><sup>111</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:44)  <i>Heb</i> "a people whom I did not know serve me." In this context the verb "know" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ud~y&#180;</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">y&#180;d^u</FONT>) probably refers to formal recognition by treaty. People who were once not under the psalmist's authority now willingly submit to his rulership to avoid being conquered militarily (see vv. 45-46). The language may recall the events recorded in 2 Sam 8:9-10 and 10:19.<br>
 <a name="fn841" href="2sa.htm#fnB841"><sup>112</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:45)  For the meaning "to be weak; to be powerless" for the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vj^K*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">K*j^v</FONT>), see Ps 109:24. Verse 46, which also mentions foreigners, favors this interpretation. Another option is to translate "cower in fear" (see Deut 33:29; Pss 66:3; 81:15).<br>
 <a name="fn842" href="2sa.htm#fnB842"><sup>113</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:45)  <i>Heb</i> "at a report of an ear they submit to me." The report of David's exploits is so impressive that those who hear it submit to his rulership without putting up a fight. <br>

The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rWx</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">xWr</FONT>, "rock") is probably accidentally repeated from the previous line. The parallel version in Ps 18:46 has simply "the God of my deliverance." <br>
 <a name="fn851" href="2sa.htm#fnB851"><sup>122</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:47)  The words "as king" are supplied in the translation for clarification. In the Psalms the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;Wr</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">rW&lt;</FONT>, "be exalted") when used of God, refers to his exalted position as king (Pss 99:2; 113:4; 138:6) and/or his self-revelation as king through his mighty deeds of deliverance (Pss 21:13; 46:10; 57:5, 11). <br>
 <a name="fn852" href="2sa.htm#fnB852"><sup>123</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:48)  <i>Heb</i> "The God is the one who grants vengeance to me." The plural form of the noun "vengeance" indicates degree here, suggesting complete vengeance or vindication. In the ancient Near East military victory was sometimes viewed as a sign that one's God had judged in favor of the victor, avenging and/or vindicating him. See, for example, Judg 11:27, 32-33, 36. <br>

 <a name="fn855" href="2sa.htm#fnB855"><sup>126</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:49)  <i>Heb</i> "you lift me up." In light of the preceding and following references to deliverance, the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;Wr</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">rW&lt;</FONT>) probably here refers to being rescued from danger (see Ps 9:13). However, it could mean "exalt; elevate" here, indicating that the LORD has given him victory over his enemies and forced them to acknowledge the psalmist's superiority. <br>
 <a name="fn856" href="2sa.htm#fnB856"><sup>127</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:49)  <i>Heb</i> "from those who rise against me."<br>

Ideally God's chosen king was to testify to the nations of God's greatness. See J. Eaton, <i>Kingship in the Psalms</i>, 182-85.  <br>
 <a name="fn858" href="2sa.htm#fnB858"><sup>129</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:50)  <i>Heb</i> "to your name." God's "name" refers metonymically to his divine characteristics as suggested by his name, in this case "LORD," the primary name of Israel's covenant God which suggests his active presence with his people (see Exod 3:12-15). <br>
 <a name="fn859" href="2sa.htm#fnB859"><sup>130</sup></a><b>tc</b> (22:51)  The translation follows the Kethib and the ancient versions in reading <i>magdil</i> ("he magnifies") rather than the Qere and many medieval Hebrew MSS of the MT which read <i>migdol</i> ("tower"). See Ps 18:50.<br>

 <a name="fn867" href="2sa.htm#fnB867"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:8)  The Hebrew word is sometimes rendered as "the three," but BDB is probably correct in taking it to refer to military officers (BDB 1026). In that case the etymological connection of this word to the Hebrew numerical adjective for "three" can be explained as originating with a designation for the <i>third</i> warrior in a chariot.<br>
 <a name="fn868" href="2sa.htm#fnB868"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tc</b> (23:8)  The translation follows some LXX MSS (see 1 Chr 11:1 as well) in reading <i>hu</i>'<i> </i>`<i>orer </i>`<i>et hanito</i> ("he raised up his spear") rather than the MT's <i>hu</i>'<i> </i>`<i>adino ha&#180;esni</i> [Kethib = <i>ha&#180;esno</i>] ("`Adino the Ezenite").

 <a name="fn875" href="2sa.htm#fnB875"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:11)  The Hebrew text is difficult here. The MT reads <i>lahayyah</i>, which implies a rare use of the word <i>hayyah</i>. The word normally refers to an animal, but if the MT is accepted it would here have the sense of a troop or community of people. BDB 312 (b), for example, understands the similar reference in v. 13 to be to "a group of allied families, making a raid together." But this works better in v. 13 than it does in v. 11, where the context seems to suggest a particular staging location for a military operation. (See 1 Chr 11:15.) It therefore seems best to understand the word in v. 11 as a place name with <i>he</i> directive. In that case the Masoretes mistook the word for the common term for an animal and then tried to make sense of it in this context.<br>

 <a name="fn877" href="2sa.htm#fnB877"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:13)  The meaning of Hebrew `<i>el qasir </i>seems here to be "at the time of harvest," although this is an unusual use of the phrase. As Driver points out, this preposition does not normally have the temporal sense of "in" or "during" (see S. R.

 <a name="fn895" href="2sa.htm#fnB895"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (24:1)  The parallel text in 1 Chr 21:1 says, "An adversary opposed Israel, inciting David to count how many warriors Israel had." The Samuel version gives an underlying theological perspective, while the Chronicler simply describes what happened from a human perspective. The adversary in 1 Chr 21:1 is likely a human enemy, probably a nearby nation whose hostility against Israel pressured David into numbering the people so he could assess his military strength. See the note at 1 Chr 21:1.<br>

 <a name="fn901" href="2sa.htm#fnB901"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tc</b> (24:13)  The LXX has here "three" rather than "seven." See 1 Chr 21:12.<br>

 <a name="fn913" href="2sa.htm#fnB913"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tc</b> (24:23)  The Hebrew text is difficult here. The translation reads `<i>ebed </i>`<i>adoni</i> ("the servant of my lord") rather than the MT's "Araunah." In normal court etiquette a subject would not use his own name in this way, but would more likely refer to himself in the third person. The MT probably first sustained loss of `<i>ebed</i> ("servant"), leading to confusion of the word for "my lord" with the name of the Jebusite referred to here.<br>
 <a name="fn914" href="2sa.htm#fnB914"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:24)  <i>Heb</i> "fifty shekels of silver." This would have been about 20 ounces (568 grams) of silver by weight.
