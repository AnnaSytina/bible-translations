<p><i>Thanksgiving for Their Response to the Gospel</i>
<p>
<bqverse 2>2  We thank God always for all of you as we mention you constantly<a name="fnB2" href="1th_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> in our prayers, 
<bqverse 3>3  because we recall<a name="fnB3" href="1th_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> in the presence of our God and Father<a name="fnB4" href="1th_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> your work of faith and labor of love and endurance of hope<a name="fnB5" href="1th_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> in our Lord Jesus Christ. 
<bqverse 4>4  We know,<a name="fnB6" href="1th_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> brothers and sisters<a name="fnB7" href="1th_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> loved by God, that he has chosen you,<a name="fnB8" href="1th_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  in that<a name="fnB9" href="1th_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> our gospel did not come to you merely in speech, but in power and in the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction (surely you recall the character we displayed when we came among you to help you).<a name="fnB10" href="1th_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 6>6  And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, when you received<a name="fnB11" href="1th_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> the message with joy that comes from the Holy Spirit, despite great affliction. 
<bqverse 7>7  As a result you became examples to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. 
<bqverse 8>8  For from you the message of the Lord<a name="fnB12" href="1th_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> has echoed forth not just in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place reports of your faith in God have spread,<a name="fnB13" href="1th_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> so that we do not need to say anything. 
<bqverse 9>9  For people everywhere<a name="fnB14" href="1th_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> report how you welcomed us<a name="fnB15" href="1th_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God 
<bqverse 10>10  and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus our deliverer from<a name="fnB16" href="1th_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> the coming wrath.<a name="fnB17" href="1th_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Paul's Ministry in Thessalonica</i>
<p><A NAME="2"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> For you yourselves know, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB18" href="1th_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> about our coming to you: it has not proven to be purposeless.<a name="fnB19" href="1th_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  But although we suffered earlier and were mistreated in Philippi, as you know, we had the courage in our God to declare to you the gospel of God in spite of much opposition. 
<bqverse 3>3  For the appeal we make<a name="fnB20" href="1th_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> does not come<a name="fnB21" href="1th_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> from error or impurity or with deceit, 
<bqverse 4>4  but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we declare it, not to please people but God, who examines our hearts. 
<bqverse 5>5  For we never appeared<a name="fnB22" href="1th_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> with flattering speech, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed--God is our witness-- 
<bqverse 6>6  nor to seek glory from people, either from you or from others, 
<bqverse 7>7  although we could have imposed our weight as apostles of Christ. But we became<a name="fnB23" href="1th_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> little children<a name="fnB24" href="1th_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> among you. Like a nursing mother caring for her own children, 
<bqverse 8>8  with such affection for you,<a name="fnB25" href="1th_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> we were happy<a name="fnB26" href="1th_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become dear to us. 
<bqverse 9>9  For you recall, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB27" href="1th_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> our toil and drudgery: by working night and day so as not to impose a burden on any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God. 
<bqverse 10>10  You are witnesses, and so is God, as to how holy and righteous and blameless our conduct was toward you who believe. 
<bqverse 11>11  As you know, we treated each one of you as a father treats his own children, 
<bqverse 12>12  exhorting and encouraging you and insisting that you live in a way worthy of God who calls you to his own kingdom and his glory. 
<bqverse 13>13  And so<a name="fnB28" href="1th_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> we too constantly thank God that when you received God's message that you heard from us,<a name="fnB29" href="1th_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> you accepted it not as a human message,<a name="fnB30" href="1th_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> but as it truly is, God's message, that is at work among you who believe. 
<bqverse 14>14  For you became imitators, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB31" href="1th_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> of God's churches in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, because you too suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they in fact did from the Jews, 
<bqverse 15>15  who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets<a name="fnB32" href="1th_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> and persecuted us severely.<a name="fnB33" href="1th_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> They are displeasing to God and are opposed to all people, 
<bqverse 16>16  because they hinder us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. Thus they constantly fill up their measure of sins,<a name="fnB34" href="1th_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> but wrath<a name="fnB35" href="1th_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> has come upon them completely.<a name="fnB36" href="1th_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc403221938"></a><a name="_Toc416894426"></a><a name="_Toc432265289"></a><a name="_Toc485060230"></a><a name="_Toc494013727"></a></p>
<p><i>Forced Absence from Them</i>
<p>
<bqverse 17>17  But when we were separated from you, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB37" href="1th_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> for a short time (in presence, not in affection)<a name="fnB38" href="1th_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> we became all the more fervent in our great desire<a name="fnB39" href="1th_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> to see you in person.<a name="fnB40" href="1th_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  For we wanted to come to you (I, Paul, in fact tried again and again)<a name="fnB41" href="1th_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> but Satan thwarted us. 
<bqverse 19>19  For who is our hope or joy or crown to boast of<a name="fnB42" href="1th_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not of course you? 
<bqverse 20>20  For you are our glory and joy!<p>

<bqchapter 3><A NAME="3"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> So when we could bear it no longer, we decided to stay on in Athens alone. 
<bqverse 2>2  We<a name="fnB43" href="1th_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> sent Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God<a name="fnB44" href="1th_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen you and encourage you about your faith, 
<bqverse 3>3  so that no one would be shaken by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we are destined for this. 
<bqverse 4>4  For in fact when we were with you, we were telling you in advance that we would suffer affliction, and so it has happened, as you well know.<a name="fnB45" href="1th_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  So<a name="fnB46" href="1th_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> when I could bear it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith, for fear that the tempter somehow tempted you and our toil had proven useless.<p>

<bqverse 6>6  But now Timothy has come<a name="fnB47" href="1th_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> to us from you and given us the good news of your faith and love and that you always think of us with affection<a name="fnB48" href="1th_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> and long to see us just as we also long to see you!<a name="fnB49" href="1th_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  So<a name="fnB50" href="1th_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> in all our distress and affliction, we were reassured about you, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB51" href="1th_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> through your faith. 
<bqverse 8>8  For now we are alive again,<a name="fnB52" href="1th_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> if you stand firm in the Lord. 
<bqverse 9>9  For how can we thank God enough for you,<a name="fnB53" href="1th_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> for all the joy we feel<a name="fnB54" href="1th_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> because of you before our God? 
<bqverse 10>10  We pray earnestly night and day to see you in person<a name="fnB55" href="1th_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> and make up what may be lacking in your faith.<p>

<bqverse 11>11  Now may God our Father himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you. 
<bqverse 12>12  And may the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love for one another and for all, just as we do for you, 
<bqverse 13>13  so that your hearts are strengthened in holiness to be blameless before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.

<p><i>A Life Pleasing to God</i>
<p><A NAME="4"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Finally then, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB56" href="1th_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received instruction from us about how<a name="fnB57" href="1th_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> you must live and please God (as you are in fact living) that you do so more and more. 
<bqverse 2>2  For you know what commands we gave you through the Lord Jesus. 
<bqverse 3>3  For this is God's will: for you to become holy,<a name="fnB58" href="1th_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> for you to keep away from sexual immorality, 
<bqverse 4>4  for each of you to know how to possess his own body<a name="fnB59" href="1th_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> in holiness and honor, 
<bqverse 5>5  not in lustful passion like the Gentiles who do not know God. 
<bqverse 6>6  In this matter no one should violate the rights of his brother or take advantage of him,<a name="fnB60" href="1th_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> because the Lord is the avenger in all these cases,<a name="fnB61" href="1th_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> as we also told you earlier and warned you solemnly. 
<bqverse 7>7  For God did not call us to impurity but in holiness. 
<bqverse 8>8  Consequently the one who rejects this is not rejecting human authority<a name="fnB62" href="1th_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.<p>

<bqverse 9>9  Now on the topic of brotherly love<a name="fnB63" href="1th_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> you have no need for anyone to write you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another. 
<bqverse 10>10  And indeed you are practicing it toward all the brothers and sisters<a name="fnB64" href="1th_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> in all of Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers and sisters, to do so more and more,<a name="fnB65" href="1th_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  to aspire to lead a quiet life, to attend to your own business, and to work with your hands, as we commanded you. 
<bqverse 12>12  In this way you will live<a name="fnB66" href="1th_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> a decent life before outsiders and not be in need.<a name="fnB67" href="1th_note.htm#fn67"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc403221940"></a><a name="_Toc416894428"></a><a name="_Toc432265291"></a><a name="_Toc485060232"></a><a name="_Toc494013729"></a></p>
<p><i>The Lord's Coming for Us</i>
<p>
<bqverse 13>13  Now we do not want you to be uninformed,<a name="fnB68" href="1th_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB69" href="1th_note.htm#fn69"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> about those who are asleep,<a name="fnB70" href="1th_note.htm#fn70"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> so that you will not grieve like the rest who have no hope. 
<bqverse 14>14  For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also we believe that<a name="fnB71" href="1th_note.htm#fn71"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep as Christians.<a name="fnB72" href="1th_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  For we tell you this by the word of the Lord,<a name="fnB73" href="1th_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will surely not go ahead of those who have fallen asleep. 
<bqverse 16>16  For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a shout of command, with the voice of the archangel,<a name="fnB74" href="1th_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. 
<bqverse 17>17  Then we who are alive, who are left, will be suddenly caught up<a name="fnB75" href="1th_note.htm#fn75"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> together<a name="fnB76" href="1th_note.htm#fn76"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord always. 
<bqverse 18>18  Therefore encourage one another with these words.

<p><i>The Day of the Lord</i>
<p><A NAME="5"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Now on the topic of times and seasons,<a name="fnB77" href="1th_note.htm#fn77"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB78" href="1th_note.htm#fn78"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> you have no need for anything to be written to you. 
<bqverse 2>2  For you know quite well that the day of the Lord<a name="fnB79" href="1th_note.htm#fn79"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> will come in the same way as a thief in the night.<a name="fnB80" href="1th_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  Now when<a name="fnB81" href="1th_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> they are saying, "There is peace and security,"<a name="fnB82" href="1th_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> then sudden destruction comes on them, like labor pains<a name="fnB83" href="1th_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> on a pregnant woman, and they will surely not escape. 
<bqverse 4>4  But you, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB84" href="1th_note.htm#fn84"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> are not in the darkness for the day to overtake you like a thief would. 
<bqverse 5>5  For you all are sons of the light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of the darkness. 
<bqverse 6>6  So then we must not sleep as the rest, but must stay alert and sober. 
<bqverse 7>7  For those who sleep sleep at night and those who get drunk are drunk at night. 
<bqverse 8>8  But since we are of the day, we must stay sober <i>by putting on the breastplate</i><a name="fnB85" href="1th_note.htm#fn85"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> of faith and love and as <i>a helmet</i> our hope <i>for salvation</i>.<a name="fnB86" href="1th_note.htm#fn86"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  For God did not destine us for wrath<a name="fnB87" href="1th_note.htm#fn87"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> but for gaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
<bqverse 10>10  He died<a name="fnB88" href="1th_note.htm#fn88"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> for us so that whether we are alert or asleep<a name="fnB89" href="1th_note.htm#fn89"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> we will come to life together with him. 
<bqverse 11>11  Therefore encourage one another and build up each other, just as you are in fact doing.<a name="_Toc416894430"></a><a name="_Toc432265293"></a><a name="_Toc485060234"></a><a name="_Toc494013731"></a></p>
<p><i>Final Instructions</i>
<p>
<bqverse 12>12  Now we ask you, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB90" href="1th_note.htm#fn90"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> to acknowledge those who labor among you and preside over you in the Lord and admonish you, 
<bqverse 13>13  and to esteem them most highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. 
<bqverse 14>14  And we urge you, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB91" href="1th_note.htm#fn91"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> admonish the undisciplined, comfort the discouraged, help the weak, be patient toward all. 
<bqverse 15>15  See that no one pays back evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good for one another and for all. 
<bqverse 16>16  Always rejoice, 
<bqverse 17>17  constantly pray, 
<bqverse 18>18  in everything give thanks. For this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus. 
<bqverse 19>19  Do not extinguish the Spirit. 
<bqverse 20>20  Do not treat prophecies with contempt. 
<bqverse 21>21  But examine all things; hold fast to what is good; 
<bqverse 22>22  stay away from every form of evil.<a name="_Toc416894431"></a><a name="_Toc432265294"></a><a name="_Toc485060235"></a><a name="_Toc494013732"></a></p>
<p><i>Closing</i>
