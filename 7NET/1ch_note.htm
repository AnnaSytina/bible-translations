 <a name="fn7" href="1ch.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:17)  The words "the sons of Aram" do not appear in the Hebrew text. Apparently the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ra ynbw</FONT> has accidentally dropped out of the text by homoioteleuton (note the presence of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ra</FONT> just before this). The phrase is included in Gen 10:23.<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="1ch.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:19)  Perhaps this refers to the scattering of the people at Babel (Gen 11:1-9).<br>

 <a name="fn12" href="1ch.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:32)  A <i>concubine</i> was a slave woman in ancient Near Eastern societies who was the legal property of her master, but who could have legitimate sexual relations with her master. A concubine's status was more elevated than a mere servant, but she was not free and did not have the legal rights of a free wife. The children of a concubine could, in some instances, become equal heirs with the children of the free wife. After the period of the Judges concubines may have become more of a royal prerogative (2 Sam 21:10-14; 1 Kgs 11:3).<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="1ch.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:36)  Many medieval Hebrew MSS, along with some LXX MSS and the Syriac, read "Zepho" (see Gen 36:11).<br>

Jerioth could be viewed as a second wife (so NLT; cf. also NASB, NIV, NRSV), but the following context mentions only "her [presumably Azubah's] sons." Another option, the one chosen in the translation, is that Jerioth is another name for Azubah.<br>

 <a name="fn41" href="1ch.htm#fnB41"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:23)  Or "Havvoth Jair." Some translations (e.g., NIV, NRSV) do not translate the phrase, but treat it as a place name.<br>
 <a name="fn42" href="1ch.htm#fnB42"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:24)  <i>Heb</i> "And after the death of Hezron in Caleb Ephrathah, and the wife of Hezron, Abijah, and she bore to him Ashhur the father of Tekoa." Perhaps one could translate: "After Hezron died in Caleb Ephrathah, Abijah, Hezron's wife, bore to him Ashhur, the father of Tekoa" (cf. NASB, NIV, NRSV). In this case the text suggests that Abijah was born after his father's death. Because of the awkward syntax and the odd appearance of "Caleb Ephrathah" as a place name, some prefer to emend the text. Some alter <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">htrpa blkb</FONT>, "in Caleb Ephrathah," to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">htrpa blk ab</FONT>, "Caleb had sexual relations with Ephrath," and then change <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hyba</FONT>, "Abijah," to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">whyba</FONT>, "his father." This results in the following translation: "And after Hezron's death, Caleb had sexual relations with Ephrath, his father Hezron's wife, and she bore to him Ashhur the father of Tekoa" (cf. NAB). This would mean that Caleb's second wife Ephrath had actually been his late father's wife (probably Caleb's stepmother). Perhaps the text was subsequently altered because Caleb's actions appeared improper in light of the injunctions in Lev 18:8; 20:11; Deut 22:30; 27:20 (which probably refer, however, to a son having sexual relations with his stepmother while his father is still alive).<br>
 <a name="fn43" href="1ch.htm#fnB43"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:31)  <i>Heb</i> "sons." The Hebrew text has the plural "sons" in all three instances in this verse, even though the following lists have only one name each.<br>
 <a name="fn44" href="1ch.htm#fnB44"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tc</b> (2:42)  <i>Heb</i> "and the sons of Mareshah," but this does not fit contextually.

The translation above assumes the following: (1) The Qal verb translated "you see me" is repointed as a Hiphil, "you showed me," (2) <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rwt</FONT> is understood in the sense of "searching, exploring," and (3) <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlumh</FONT> is taken in a temporal sense of "that which lies beyond."

(58.9 kg), but later this was lowed to 108.3 lbs. (49.1 kg). More recent research suggests the "light" standard talent was 67.3 lbs. (30.6 kg).

The Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/f*c*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">c*f*/</FONT>) can refer to an adversary in general or Satan in particular. There is no article accompanying the term here, which suggests it should be understood generally.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (21:1)  The parallel text in 2 Sam 24:1 says, "The LORD's anger again raged against Israel and he incited David against them, saying: `Go, count Israel and Judah!'" The version of the incident in the Book of 2 Samuel gives an underlying theological perspective, while the Chronicler simply describes what happened from a human perspective. Many interpreters and translations render the Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/fc</FONT> as a proper name here, "Satan" (NEB, NASB, NIV, NRSV). However, the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/fc</FONT>, which means "adversary," is used here without the article. Elsewhere when it appears without the article, it refers to a personal or national adversary in the human sphere, the lone exception being Num 22:22, 32, where the angel of the Lord assumes the role of an adversary to Balaam. When referring elsewhere to the spiritual entity known in the NT as Satan, the noun has the article and is used as a title, "the Adversary" (see Job 1:6-9, 12; 2:1-4, 6-7; Zech 3:1-2). In light of usage elsewhere the adversary in 1 Chr 21:1 is likely a human enemy, probably a nearby nation whose hostility against Israel pressured David into numbering the people so he could assess his military strength. For compelling linguistic and literary arguments against taking the noun as a proper name here, see S. Japhet, <i>I &amp; II Chronicles</i> (OTL), 374-75.<br>
