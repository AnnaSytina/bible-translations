<p><A NAME="1"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>What follows is divine revelation.<a name="fnB0" href="mal_note.htm#fn0"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> The word of the LORD came to Israel through Malachi:<a name="fnB1" href="mal_note.htm#fn1"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 2>2 "I have shown love to you," says the LORD; but you say, "How have you shown love to us?" <p>
"Esau was Jacob's brother," the LORD explains, "yet I chose Jacob, 
<bqverse 3>3 and rejected Esau.<a name="fnB2" href="mal_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> I made Esau's<a name="fnB3" href="mal_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> mountains bare of population<a name="fnB4" href="mal_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and gave his land<a name="fnB5" href="mal_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> to the jackals of the desert." <p>

<bqverse 4>4 Edom<a name="fnB6" href="mal_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> says, "Though we are devastated, we will once again build the ruined places." So the sovereign LORD<a name="fnB7" href="mal_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> responds, "They indeed may build, but I will overthrow. They will be known as<a name="fnB8" href="mal_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> the land of evil, the people with whom the LORD is permanently displeased. 
<bqverse 5>5 Your eyes will see it, and then you will say, `May the LORD be magnified<a name="fnB9" href="mal_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> even beyond the border of Israel!'"<a name="_Toc494013057"></a></p>
<p><i>The Sacrilege of Priestly Service</i>
<p>
<bqverse 6>6  "A son naturally honors his father and a slave respects<a name="fnB10" href="mal_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> his master. If I am your<a name="fnB11" href="mal_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> father, where is my honor? If I am your<a name="fnB12" href="mal_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> master, where is my respect? The sovereign LORD asks you this, you priests who make light of my name! But you reply, `How have we made light of your name?' 
<bqverse 7>7 You are offering improper sacrifices on my altar, yet you ask, `How have we offended you?' By treating the table<a name="fnB13" href="mal_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> of the LORD as if it is of no importance! 
<bqverse 8>8 For when you offer blind animals as a sacrifice, is that not wrong? And when you offer the lame and sick,<a name="fnB14" href="mal_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> is that not wrong as well? Indeed, try offering them<a name="fnB15" href="mal_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> to your governor! Will he be pleased with you<a name="fnB16" href="mal_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> or show you favor?" asks the sovereign LORD. 
<bqverse 9>9 But now plead for God's favor<a name="fnB17" href="mal_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> that he might be gracious to us.<a name="fnB18" href="mal_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> "With this kind of thing in your hands, how can he be pleased with you?" asks the sovereign LORD.<p>

<bqverse 10>10 "I wish that one of you would close the temple doors,<a name="fnB19" href="mal_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> so that you no longer would light useless fires on my altar. I am not pleased with you," says the sovereign LORD, "and I will no longer accept an offering from you. 
<bqverse 11>11 For from the east to the west my name will be great among the nations. Incense and pure offerings will be offered in my name everywhere, for my name will be great among the nations,"<a name="fnB20" href="mal_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> says the sovereign LORD. 
<bqverse 12>12 "But you are profaning it by saying that the table of the Lord is common and its offerings<a name="fnB21" href="mal_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> despicable. 
<bqverse 13>13 You also say, `How tiresome it is.' You turn up your nose at it," says the sovereign LORD, "and instead bring what is stolen, lame, or sick. You bring these things for an offering! Should I accept this from you?"<a name="fnB22" href="mal_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> asks the LORD. 
<bqverse 14>14 "There will be harsh condemnation for the hypocrite who has a valuable male animal in his flock but vows and sacrifices something inferior to the Lord. For I am a great king,"<a name="fnB23" href="mal_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> says the sovereign LORD, "and my name is awesome among the nations."

<p><i>The Sacrilege of the Priestly Message</i>
<p><A NAME="2"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>"Now, you priests, this commandment is for you. 
<bqverse 2>2 If you do not listen and take seriously<a name="fnB24" href="mal_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> the need to honor my name," says the sovereign LORD, "I will send judgment<a name="fnB25" href="mal_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> on you and turn your blessings into curses--indeed, I have already done so because you are not taking it to heart. 
<bqverse 3>3 I am about to discipline your children<a name="fnB26" href="mal_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> and will spread offal<a name="fnB27" href="mal_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> on your faces,<a name="fnB28" href="mal_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> the very offal produced at your festivals, and you will be carried away along with it. 
<bqverse 4>4 Then you will know that I sent this commandment to you so that my covenant<a name="fnB29" href="mal_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> may continue to be with Levi," says the sovereign LORD. 
<bqverse 5>5 "My covenant with him was designed to bring life and peace. I gave its statutes to him to fill him with awe, and he indeed revered me and stood in awe before me. 
<bqverse 6>6 He taught what was true;<a name="fnB30" href="mal_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> sinful words were not found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and integrity and he turned many people away from sin. 
<bqverse 7>7 For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge of sacred things, and people should seek instruction from him<a name="fnB31" href="mal_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> because he is the messenger of the sovereign LORD. 
<bqverse 8>8 You, however, have turned from the way. You have caused many to violate the law;<a name="fnB32" href="mal_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> you have corrupted the covenant with Levi,"<a name="fnB33" href="mal_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> says the sovereign LORD. 
<bqverse 9>9 "Therefore, I have caused you to be ignored and belittled before all people to the extent to which you are not following after me and are showing partiality in your<a name="fnB34" href="mal_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> instruction."<a name="_Toc494013059"></a></p>
<p><i>The Rebellion of the People</i>
<p>
<bqverse 10>10 Do we not all have one father?<a name="fnB35" href="mal_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> Did not one God create us? Why do we betray one another, in this way making light of the covenant of our ancestors? 
<bqverse 11>11 Judah has become disloyal, and unspeakable sins have been committed in Israel and Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned<a name="fnB36" href="mal_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> the holy things that the LORD loves and has turned to a foreign god!<a name="fnB37" href="mal_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12 May the LORD cut off from the community<a name="fnB38" href="mal_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> of Jacob every last person who does this,<a name="fnB39" href="mal_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> as well as the person who presents improper offerings to the sovereign LORD! <p>

<bqverse 13>13 You also do this: You cover the altar of the LORD with tears<a name="fnB40" href="mal_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> as you weep and groan, because he no longer pays any attention to the offering nor accepts it favorably from you. 
<bqverse 14>14 Yet you ask, "Why?" The answer is that the LORD is testifying against you on behalf of the wife you married when you were young<a name="fnB41" href="mal_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and to whom you have become unfaithful, though she is your companion and wife by covenant.<a name="fnB42" href="mal_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15 No one does this who has even a small portion of the Spirit in him.<a name="fnB43" href="mal_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> What did that one of our ancient times<a name="fnB44" href="mal_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> do when seeking a child from God? Be attentive, then, to your own spirit, for one should not be disloyal to the wife he took in his youth.<a name="fnB45" href="mal_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16 "I hate divorce,"<a name="fnB46" href="mal_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> says the LORD God of Israel, "and the one who is guilty of violence,"<a name="fnB47" href="mal_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> says the sovereign LORD. "Pay attention to your conscience, and do not be unfaithful."<a name="_Toc494013060"></a></p>
<p><i>Resistance to the Lord through Self-deceit</i>
<p>
<bqverse 17>17 You have wearied the LORD with your words. But you say, "How have we wearied him?" Because you say, "Everyone who does evil is good in the Lord's opinion,<a name="fnB48" href="mal_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> and he delights in them," or, "Where is the God of justice?" 
<bqchapter 3><A NAME="3"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>"I am about to send my messenger,<a name="fnB49" href="mal_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> who will clear the way before me. Indeed, the Lord<a name="fnB50" href="mal_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> you are seeking will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger<a name="fnB51" href="mal_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> of the covenant whom you long for is coming," says the sovereign LORD. <p>

<bqverse 2>2 Who can endure the day of his coming? Who can keep standing when he appears? For he will be like a refiner's fire,<a name="fnB52" href="mal_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> like a launderer's soap. 
<bqverse 3>3 He will act like a refiner and purifier of silver and will cleanse the Levites and refine them like gold and silver. Then they will offer the LORD a proper offering. 
<bqverse 4>4 The gift<a name="fnB53" href="mal_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD as in former times and years past. <p>

<bqverse 5>5 "I<a name="fnB54" href="mal_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> will come to you in judgment. I will be quick to testify against those who practice divination, those who commit adultery, those who break promises,<a name="fnB55" href="mal_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> and those who exploit workers, widows and orphans,<a name="fnB56" href="mal_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> who refuse to help<a name="fnB57" href="mal_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> the immigrant<a name="fnB58" href="mal_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> and in this way show they do not fear me," says the sovereign LORD.<a name="_Toc494013061"></a></p>
<p><i>Resistance to the Lord through Selfishness</i>
<p>
<bqverse 6>6 "Since, I, the LORD, do not go back on my promises,<a name="fnB59" href="mal_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> you, sons of Jacob, have not perished. 
<bqverse 7>7 From the days of your ancestors you have ignored<a name="fnB60" href="mal_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> my commandments<a name="fnB61" href="mal_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> and have not kept them! Return to me, and I will return to you," says the sovereign LORD. <p>
"But you say, `How should we return?' 
<bqverse 8>8 Can a person rob<a name="fnB62" href="mal_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> God? You indeed are robbing me, but you say, `How are we robbing you?' In tithes and contributions!<a name="fnB63" href="mal_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9 You are bound for judgment<a name="fnB64" href="mal_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> because you are robbing me--this whole nation is guilty.<a name="fnB65" href="mal_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 10>10  "Bring the entire tithe into the storehouse<a name="fnB66" href="mal_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> so that there may be food in my temple. Test me in this matter," says the sovereign LORD, "to see if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you a blessing until there is no room for it all. 
<bqverse 11>11 Then I will stop the plague<a name="fnB67" href="mal_note.htm#fn67"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> from ruining your crops;<a name="fnB68" href="mal_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> the vine will not lose its fruit before harvest," says the sovereign LORD. 
<bqverse 12>12 "All nations will call you happy, for you indeed will live in<a name="fnB69" href="mal_note.htm#fn69"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> a delightful land," says the sovereign LORD.<a name="_Toc494013062"></a></p>
<p><i>Resistance to the Lord through Self-sufficiency</i>
<p>
<bqverse 13>13 "You have criticized me sharply,"<a name="fnB70" href="mal_note.htm#fn70"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> says the LORD, "but you ask, `How have we criticized you?' 
<bqverse 14>14 You have said, `It is useless to serve God. How have we been helped<a name="fnB71" href="mal_note.htm#fn71"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> by keeping his requirements and going about like mourners before him?<a name="fnB72" href="mal_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15 So now we consider the arrogant to be happy; indeed, those who practice evil are successful.<a name="fnB73" href="mal_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> In fact, those who challenge<a name="fnB74" href="mal_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> God escape.'" <p>

<bqverse 16>16 Then those who respect<a name="fnB75" href="mal_note.htm#fn75"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD spoke to one another, and the LORD took notice.<a name="fnB76" href="mal_note.htm#fn76"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> A scroll<a name="fnB77" href="mal_note.htm#fn77"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> was prepared before him in which were recorded the names of those who respect the LORD and honor his name. 
<bqverse 17>17 "They will belong to me," says the sovereign LORD, "in the day when I prepare my own property.<a name="fnB78" href="mal_note.htm#fn78"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him. 
<bqverse 18>18 Then once more you will see that I make a distinction between<a name="fnB79" href="mal_note.htm#fn79"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> the righteous and the wicked, between the one who serves God and the one who does not. <p>
