<p><A NAME="1"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> This is the record of the genealogy<a name="fnB0" href="mat_note.htm#fn0"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.<p>

<bqverse 2>2  Abraham was the father<a name="fnB1" href="mat_note.htm#fn1"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers, 
<bqverse 3>3  Judah the father of Perez and Zerah (by Tamar), Perez the father of Hezron, Hezron the father of Ram, 
<bqverse 4>4 Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon, 
<bqverse 5>5 Salmon the father of Boaz (by Rahab), Boaz the father of Obed (by Ruth), Obed the father of Jesse, 
<bqverse 6>6 and Jesse the father of David the king.<p>
David was the father of Solomon (by the wife of Uriah<a name="fnB2" href="mat_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a>), 
<bqverse 7>7  Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa,<a name="fnB3" href="mat_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah, 
<bqverse 9>9  Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah, 
<bqverse 10>10 Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon,<a name="fnB4" href="mat_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> Amon the father of Josiah, 
<bqverse 11>11  and Josiah<a name="fnB5" href="mat_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> the father of Jeconiah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.<p>

<bqverse 12>12  After<a name="fnB6" href="mat_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> the deportation to Babylon, Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel,<a name="fnB7" href="mat_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel, 
<bqverse 13>13  Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor, 
<bqverse 14>14  Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, Achim the father of Eliud, 
<bqverse 15>15  Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob, 
<bqverse 16>16  and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom<a name="fnB8" href="mat_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> Jesus was born, who is called Christ.<a name="fnB9" href="mat_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 17>17  So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to Christ,<a name="fnB10" href="mat_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> fourteen generations.<a name="_Toc403221279"></a><a name="_Toc416893767"></a><a name="_Toc432264629"></a><a name="_Toc485059569"></a><a name="_Toc494013066"></a></p>
<p><i>The Birth of Jesus Christ</i>
<p>
<bqverse 18>18  Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened this way. While his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, but before they came together,<a name="fnB11" href="mat_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. 
<bqverse 19>19  Because Joseph, her husband to be,<a name="fnB12" href="mat_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> was a righteous man, and because he did not want to disgrace her, he intended to divorce her<a name="fnB13" href="mat_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> privately. 
<bqverse 20>20 When he had contemplated this, an<a name="fnB14" href="mat_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> angel of the Lord<a name="fnB15" href="mat_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. 
<bqverse 21>21  She will give birth to a son and you will name him<a name="fnB16" href="mat_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> Jesus,<a name="fnB17" href="mat_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> because he will save his people from their sins." 
<bqverse 22>22  This all happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled: 
<bqverse 23>23  "<b><i>Look! The virgin will conceive and bear a son, and they will call him</i></b><a name="fnB18" href="mat_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> Emmanuel</i></b>,"<a name="fnB19" href="mat_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> which means<a name="fnB20" href="mat_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> "<i>God with us</i>."<a name="fnB21" href="mat_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  When Joseph awoke from sleep he did what the angel of the Lord<a name="fnB22" href="mat_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> told him. He took his wife, 
<bqverse 25>25  but did not have marital relations<a name="fnB23" href="mat_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> with her until she gave birth to a son, whom he named<a name="fnB24" href="mat_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> Jesus.

<p><i>The Visit of the Wise Men</i>
<p><A NAME="2"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, in the time<a name="fnB25" href="mat_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> of King Herod,<a name="fnB26" href="mat_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> wise men<a name="fnB27" href="mat_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> from the East came to Jerusalem 
<bqverse 2>2  saying, "Where is the one who is born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose<a name="fnB28" href="mat_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> and have come to worship him. 
<bqverse 3>3  When King Herod<a name="fnB29" href="mat_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> heard this he was alarmed, and all Jerusalem with him. 
<bqverse 4>4  After assembling all the chief priests and experts in the law<a name="fnB30" href="mat_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> he asked them where the Christ<a name="fnB31" href="mat_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> was to be born. 
<bqverse 5>5  "In Bethlehem of Judea," they said, "for it is written this way by the prophet:</p>
<br><b><i>
<bqverse 6>6 `<b><i>And</i></b><i> <b>you, Bethlehem,</b> in the land of Judah,</i><br>
<b><i>are in no way least among the rulers of Judah,</i></b><br>

<bqverse 7>7  Then Herod<a name="fnB33" href="mat_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> privately summoned the wise men and determined from them when the star had appeared. 
<bqverse 8>8  He<a name="fnB34" href="mat_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and look carefully for the child. When you find him, inform me so that I can go and worship him as well." 
<bqverse 9>9 After listening to the king they left, and once again<a name="fnB35" href="mat_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> the star they saw when it rose<a name="fnB36" href="mat_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> led them until it stopped above the place where the child was.
<bqverse 10>10  When they saw the star they shouted joyfully.<a name="fnB37" href="mat_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11 As they came into the house and saw the child with Mary his mother, they bowed down<a name="fnB38" href="mat_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> and worshiped him. They opened their treasure boxes and gave him gifts of gold, frankincense,<a name="fnB39" href="mat_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> and myrrh.<a name="fnB40" href="mat_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  After being warned in a dream not to return to Herod,<a name="fnB41" href="mat_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> they went back by another route to their own country.<a name="_Toc403221281"></a><a name="_Toc416893769"></a><a name="_Toc432264631"></a><a name="_Toc485059571"></a><a name="_Toc494013068"></a></p>
<p><i>The Escape to Egypt</i>
<p>
<bqverse 13>13  After they had gone, an<a name="fnB42" href="mat_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> angel of the Lord<a name="fnB43" href="mat_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> appeared in a dream to Joseph saying, "Get up, take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod<a name="fnB44" href="mat_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> is going to look for the child to kill him." 
<bqverse 14>14 Then he got up, took the child and his mother at night, and went to Egypt. 
<bqverse 15>15  He stayed there until Herod<a name="fnB45" href="mat_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> died. In this way what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet was fulfilled: "<b><i>I called my Son out of Egypt</i></b>."<a name="fnB46" href="mat_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 16>16  When Herod<a name="fnB47" href="mat_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he became outraged. He sent men<a name="fnB48" href="mat_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> to kill all the children in Bethlehem and nearby from the age of two and under, according to the time he had learned from the wise men. 
<bqverse 17>17  Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: </p>
<br><b><i>
<bqverse 18>18 "<b><i>A voice was heard in Ramah, </i></b><br>

<p>
<bqverse 19>19  After Herod<a name="fnB51" href="mat_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> had died, an<a name="fnB52" href="mat_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> angel of the Lord<a name="fnB53" href="mat_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt 
<bqverse 20>20 saying, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's life are dead." 
<bqverse 21>21  So<a name="fnB54" href="mat_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> he got up and took the child and his mother and returned to the land of Israel. 
<bqverse 22>22  But when he heard that Archelaus<a name="fnB55" href="mat_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod,<a name="fnB56" href="mat_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> he was afraid to go there. After being warned in a dream, he went to the regions of Galilee. 
<bqverse 23>23  He came to a town called Nazareth<a name="fnB57" href="mat_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> and lived there. Then what had been spoken by the prophets was fulfilled, that he would be called a Nazarene.<a name="fnB58" href="mat_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>The Ministry of John the Baptist</i>
<p><A NAME="3"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> In those days John the Baptist came into the wilderness<a name="fnB59" href="mat_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> of Judea proclaiming,<a name="fnB60" href="mat_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 2>2  "Repent,<a name="fnB61" href="mat_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> for the kingdom of heaven is near." 
<bqverse 3>3  For he is the one who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet,<a name="fnB62" href="mat_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> </p>
<br><b><i>"<b><i>The voice</i></b><a name="fnB63" href="mat_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> of one crying out in the wilderness, </i></b><br>

<bqverse 4>4  Now John wore clothing made from camel's hair with a leather belt around his waist, and his diet consisted of locusts and wild honey.<a name="fnB66" href="mat_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  Then people from Jerusalem,<a name="fnB67" href="mat_note.htm#fn67"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> as well as all Judea and all the region around the Jordan, were going out to him,
<bqverse 6>6  and he was baptizing them<a name="fnB68" href="mat_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins.<p>

<bqverse 7>7 But when he saw many Pharisees<a name="fnB69" href="mat_note.htm#fn69"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> and Sadducees<a name="fnB70" href="mat_note.htm#fn70"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> coming to his baptism, he said to them, "You offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 
<bqverse 8>8  Therefore produce fruit<a name="fnB71" href="mat_note.htm#fn71"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> that proves your<a name="fnB72" href="mat_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> repentance,
<bqverse 9>9  and don't think you can say to yourselves, `We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that God can raise up children to Abraham from these stones! 
<bqverse 10>10  Even now the ax is laid at<a name="fnB73" href="mat_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.<p>

<bqverse 11>11  "I baptize you with water, for repentance, but the one coming after me is more powerful than I am--I am not worthy<a name="fnB74" href="mat_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> to carry his sandals.

<p><i>The Baptism of Jesus</i>

<bqverse 14>14 But John<a name="fnB80" href="mat_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> tried to prevent<a name="fnB81" href="mat_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?" 
<bqverse 15>15  So Jesus replied<a name="fnB82" href="mat_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> to him, "Let it happen now,<a name="fnB83" href="mat_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> for it is right for us to fulfill all righteousness."

<bqverse 16>16  After<a name="fnB86" href="mat_note.htm#fn86"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> Jesus was baptized, just as he was coming up out of the water, the<a name="fnB87" href="mat_note.htm#fn87"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> heavens<a name="fnB88" href="mat_note.htm#fn88"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> opened<a name="fnB89" href="mat_note.htm#fn89"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> and he saw the Spirit of God<a name="fnB90" href="mat_note.htm#fn90"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> descending like a dove<a name="fnB91" href="mat_note.htm#fn91"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> and coming on him.

<bqverse 32>32 For the unconverted<a name="fnB226" href="mat_note.htm#fn226"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> pursue these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.

<bqverse 2>2  But when the Pharisees<a name="fnB503" href="mat_note.htm#fn503"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> saw this they said to him, "Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath." 
<bqverse 3>3  He<a name="fnB504" href="mat_note.htm#fn504"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> said to them, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry--

<bqverse 5>5  Or have you not read in the law that the priests in the temple desecrate the Sabbath and yet are not guilty? 
<bqverse 6>6  I<a name="fnB509" href="mat_note.htm#fn509"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> tell you that something greater than the temple is here.
<bqverse 7>7  If<a name="fnB510" href="mat_note.htm#fn510"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> you had known what this means: `<b><i>I want mercy and not sacrifice</i></b>,'<a name="fnB511" href="mat_note.htm#fn511"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> you would not have condemned the innocent.

<bqverse 9>9 Then<a name="fnB513" href="mat_note.htm#fn513"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> Jesus<a name="fnB514" href="mat_note.htm#fn514"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> left that place and entered their synagogue.<a name="fnB515" href="mat_note.htm#fn515"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 10>10  A<a name="fnB516" href="mat_note.htm#fn516"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> man was there who had a withered<a name="fnB517" href="mat_note.htm#fn517"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> hand.

<bqverse 11>11  He said to them, "Would not anyone of you, if he had one sheep that fell into a pit on the Sabbath, take hold of it and lift it out? 
<bqverse 12>12  How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath." 
<bqverse 13>13  Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out and it was restored,<a name="fnB520" href="mat_note.htm#fn520"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> as healthy as the other. 
<bqverse 14>14  But the Pharisees went out and plotted against him, as to how they could assassinate<a name="fnB521" href="mat_note.htm#fn521"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> him.<a name="_Toc403221330"></a><a name="_Toc416893818"></a><a name="_Toc432264680"></a><a name="_Toc485059620"></a><a name="_Toc494013117"></a></p>

<bqverse 16>16  But he sternly warned them not to make him known. 
<bqverse 17>17 This fulfilled what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet:<a name="fnB524" href="mat_note.htm#fn524"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> </p>

<bqverse 23>23  All the crowds were amazed and said, "Could this one be the Son of David?"

<bqverse 25>25  Now when Jesus<a name="fnB534" href="mat_note.htm#fn534"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> realized what they were thinking, he said to them,<a name="fnB535" href="mat_note.htm#fn535"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> "Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed,<a name="fnB536" href="mat_note.htm#fn536"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> and no town or house divided against itself will stand.

<bqverse 3>3  He<a name="fnB588" href="mat_note.htm#fn588"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> told them many things in parables,<a name="fnB589" href="mat_note.htm#fn589"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> saying: "Listen!<a name="fnB590" href="mat_note.htm#fn590"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> A sower went out to sow.<a name="fnB591" href="mat_note.htm#fn591"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it. 
<bqverse 5>5  Other<a name="fnB592" href="mat_note.htm#fn592"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> seed fell on rocky ground<a name="fnB593" href="mat_note.htm#fn593"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly because the soil was not deep.<a name="fnB594" href="mat_note.htm#fn594"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 6>6  But when the sun came up it was scorched, and because it did not have a root, it withered. 
<bqverse 7>7  Other seed fell among the thorns,<a name="fnB595" href="mat_note.htm#fn595"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> and they grew up and choked it.<a name="fnB596" href="mat_note.htm#fn596"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  But other seed fell on good soil and it produced grain, some a hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty. 
<bqverse 9>9 The one who has ears had better listen!"<a name="fnB597" href="mat_note.htm#fn597"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 10>10 Then<a name="fnB598" href="mat_note.htm#fn598"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> the disciples came to him and said, "Why do you speak to them in parables?" 
<bqverse 11>11 He replied,<a name="fnB599" href="mat_note.htm#fn599"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> "You have been given<a name="fnB600" href="mat_note.htm#fn600"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> the opportunity to know<a name="fnB601" href="mat_note.htm#fn601"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> the secrets<a name="fnB602" href="mat_note.htm#fn602"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> of the kingdom of heaven, but they have not.

<bqverse 13>13  For this reason I speak to them in parables: although they see they do not see, and although they hear they do not hear nor do they understand.

<bqverse 34>34  Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the crowds; he did not speak to them without a parable.

<bqverse 36>36  Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him saying, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field." 
<bqverse 37>37  He<a name="fnB639" href="mat_note.htm#fn639"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> answered, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.
<bqverse 38>38  The field is the world and the good seed are the people<a name="fnB640" href="mat_note.htm#fn640"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> of the kingdom.

<bqverse 44>44  "The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure, hidden in a field, that a person found and hid. Then because of joy he went and sold all that he had and bought that field.<p>

<bqverse 45>45  "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls. 
<bqverse 46>46  When he found a pearl of great value, he went out and sold everything he had and bought it.<p>

<bqverse 47>47  "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea that caught all kinds of fish. 
<bqverse 48>48  When it was full, they pulled it ashore, sat down, and put the good fish into containers and threw the bad away.

<bqverse 51>51  "Have you understood all these things?" They replied, "Yes."
<bqverse 52>52  Then he said to them, "Therefore every expert in the law<a name="fnB648" href="mat_note.htm#fn648"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his treasure what is new and old."<a name="_Toc403221344"></a><a name="_Toc416893832"></a><a name="_Toc432264693"></a><a name="_Toc485059633"></a><a name="_Toc494013130"></a></p>

<bqverse 54>54  Then<a name="fnB650" href="mat_note.htm#fn650"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> he came to his hometown<a name="fnB651" href="mat_note.htm#fn651"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> and began to teach the people<a name="fnB652" href="mat_note.htm#fn652"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a> in their synagogue.<a name="fnB653" href="mat_note.htm#fn653"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> They<a name="fnB654" href="mat_note.htm#fn654"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a> were astonished and said, "Where did this man get such wisdom and miraculous powers?

<bqverse 57>57 And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own house."
<bqverse 58>58  And he did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.

<p><i>The Death of John the Baptist</i>
<p><A NAME="14"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>At that time Herod the tetrarch<a name="fnB657" href="mat_note.htm#fn657"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> heard reports about Jesus, 
<bqverse 2>2  and he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead! And because of this, miraculous powers are at work in him."
<bqverse 3>3 For Herod had arrested John, bound him,<a name="fnB658" href="mat_note.htm#fn658"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; 
<bqverse 4>4  for John had repeatedly told<a name="fnB659" href="mat_note.htm#fn659"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."<a name="fnB660" href="mat_note.htm#fn660"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  Although<a name="fnB661" href="mat_note.htm#fn661"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> he wanted to kill John,<a name="fnB662" href="mat_note.htm#fn662"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> he feared the crowd, because they accepted him as a prophet. 
<bqverse 6>6  But on Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod, 
<bqverse 7>7  so much that he promised with an oath<a name="fnB663" href="mat_note.htm#fn663"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> to give her whatever she asked. 
<bqverse 8>8  Instructed by her mother, she said, "Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter." 
<bqverse 9>9  Although it grieved the king,<a name="fnB664" href="mat_note.htm#fn664"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> because of his oath and the dinner guests he commanded it to be given.
<bqverse 10>10  So<a name="fnB665" href="mat_note.htm#fn665"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> he sent and had John beheaded in the prison. 
<bqverse 11>11  His<a name="fnB666" href="mat_note.htm#fn666"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.
<bqverse 12>12 Then John's<a name="fnB667" href="mat_note.htm#fn667"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> disciples came and took the body and buried it and went and told Jesus.<a name="_Toc403221346"></a><a name="_Toc416893834"></a><a name="_Toc432264695"></a><a name="_Toc485059635"></a><a name="_Toc494013132"></a></p>
<p><i>The Feeding of the Five Thousand </i>
<p>
<bqverse 13>13  Now when Jesus heard this he went away from there privately in a boat to an isolated place. But when the crowd heard about it,<a name="fnB668" href="mat_note.htm#fn668"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> they followed him on foot from the towns.<a name="fnB669" href="mat_note.htm#fn669"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 14>14  As he got out he saw the large crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
<bqverse 15>15  When it became evening his disciples came to him saying, "This is an isolated place<a name="fnB670" href="mat_note.htm#fn670"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> and the hour is already late. Send the crowds away so that they can go into the villages and buy food for themselves."
<bqverse 16>16  But he<a name="fnB671" href="mat_note.htm#fn671"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> said to them, "They don't need to go. You<a name="fnB672" href="mat_note.htm#fn672"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> give them something to eat."
<bqverse 17>17  They<a name="fnB673" href="mat_note.htm#fn673"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> said to him, "We have here only five loaves and two fish." 
<bqverse 18>18  "Bring them here to me," he said.
<bqverse 19>19  Then<a name="fnB674" href="mat_note.htm#fn674"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> he instructed the crowds to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and two fish, and looking up to heaven he gave thanks and broke the loaves. He gave them to the disciples,<a name="fnB675" href="mat_note.htm#fn675"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> who in turn gave them to the crowds.<a name="fnB676" href="mat_note.htm#fn676"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 20>20  They all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces left over, twelve baskets full.
<bqverse 21>21  Not counting women and children, there were about five thousand men who ate.<a name="_Toc403221347"></a><a name="_Toc416893835"></a><a name="_Toc432264696"></a><a name="_Toc485059636"></a><a name="_Toc494013133"></a></p>
<p><i>Walking on Water </i>

<bqverse 22>22  Immediately Jesus<a name="fnB677" href="mat_note.htm#fn677"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he dispersed the crowds.
<bqverse 23>23  And after he sent the crowds away, he went up the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
<bqverse 24>24 Meanwhile the boat, already far from land,<a name="fnB678" href="mat_note.htm#fn678"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> was taking a beating from the waves, because the wind was against it. 
<bqverse 25>25  As the night was ending,<a name="fnB679" href="mat_note.htm#fn679"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> Jesus came to them walking on the sea.<a name="fnB680" href="mat_note.htm#fn680"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 26>26  When<a name="fnB681" href="mat_note.htm#fn681"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> the disciples saw him walking on the water<a name="fnB682" href="mat_note.htm#fn682"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> they were terrified and said, "It's a ghost!" and cried out with fear.
<bqverse 27>27  But immediately he<a name="fnB683" href="mat_note.htm#fn683"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> spoke to them:<a name="fnB684" href="mat_note.htm#fn684"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> "Have courage! It is I. Do not be afraid." 
<bqverse 28>28  Peter<a name="fnB685" href="mat_note.htm#fn685"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> said to him,<a name="fnB686" href="mat_note.htm#fn686"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> "Lord, if it is you, order me to come to you on the water." 
<bqverse 29>29  So he said, "Come." Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus. 
<bqverse 30>30  But when he saw the strong wind he became afraid. And starting to sink, he cried out,<a name="fnB687" href="mat_note.htm#fn687"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> "Lord, save me!" 
<bqverse 31>31  Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him, saying to him, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"
<bqverse 32>32  When they went up into the boat, the wind ceased.
<bqverse 33>33  Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God."<p>

<bqverse 34>34 After they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.<a name="fnB688" href="mat_note.htm#fn688"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 35>35  When the people there recognized him, they sent word into all the surrounding area, and they brought all their sick to him.
<bqverse 36>36  They begged him if<a name="fnB689" href="mat_note.htm#fn689"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> they could only touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.

<bqverse 11>11 What defiles a person is not what goes into the mouth; it is what<a name="fnB703" href="mat_note.htm#fn703"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> comes out of the mouth that defiles a person." 
<bqverse 12>12 Then the disciples came to him and said, "Do you know that when the Pharisees<a name="fnB704" href="mat_note.htm#fn704"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> heard this saying they were offended?"

<p><i>The Faith of a Canaanite Woman </i>

<bqverse 21>21  After going out from there, Jesus went to the region of Tyre and Sidon. 
<bqverse 22>22  A<a name="fnB711" href="mat_note.htm#fn711"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> Canaanite woman from that area came<a name="fnB712" href="mat_note.htm#fn712"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> and cried out,<a name="fnB713" href="mat_note.htm#fn713"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is horribly demon-possessed!" 
<bqverse 23>23  But he did not answer her a word. Then<a name="fnB714" href="mat_note.htm#fn714"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> his disciples came and begged him,<a name="fnB715" href="mat_note.htm#fn715"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> "Send her away, because she keeps on crying out after us."
<bqverse 24>24  So<a name="fnB716" href="mat_note.htm#fn716"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> he answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." 
<bqverse 25>25  But she came and bowed down<a name="fnB717" href="mat_note.htm#fn717"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> before him and said,<a name="fnB718" href="mat_note.htm#fn718"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> "Lord, help me!" 
<bqverse 26>26  "It is not right<a name="fnB719" href="mat_note.htm#fn719"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs,"<a name="fnB720" href="mat_note.htm#fn720"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> he said.<a name="fnB721" href="mat_note.htm#fn721"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 27>27  "Yes, Lord," she replied,<a name="fnB722" href="mat_note.htm#fn722"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> "but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table." 
<bqverse 28>28  Then<a name="fnB723" href="mat_note.htm#fn723"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> Jesus answered her, "Woman,<a name="fnB724" href="mat_note.htm#fn724"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> your faith is great!

<p><i>Healing Many Others </i>

<bqverse 29>29 When he left there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain, where he sat down.
<bqverse 30>30  Then<a name="fnB725" href="mat_note.htm#fn725"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> large crowds came to him bringing with them the lame, blind, crippled, mute, and many others. They<a name="fnB726" href="mat_note.htm#fn726"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> laid them at his feet, and he healed them. 
<bqverse 31>31  As a result, the crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing, and they praised the God of Israel.<a name="_Toc403221352"></a><a name="_Toc416893840"></a><a name="_Toc432264701"></a><a name="_Toc485059641"></a><a name="_Toc494013138"></a></p>
<p><i>The Feeding of the Four Thousand</i>

<bqverse 32>32  Then Jesus called the<a name="fnB727" href="mat_note.htm#fn727"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> disciples and said, "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have already been here with me three days and they have nothing to eat. I don't want to send them away hungry since they may faint on the way." 
<bqverse 33>33  The disciples said to him, "Where can we get enough bread in this desolate place to satisfy so great a crowd?" 
<bqverse 34>34  Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They replied, "Seven--and a few small fish." 
<bqverse 35>35  After instructing the crowd to sit down on the ground, 
<bqverse 36>36  he took the seven loaves and the fish, and after giving thanks, he broke them and began giving them to the disciples, who then gave them to the crowds.<a name="fnB728" href="mat_note.htm#fn728"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 37>37  They<a name="fnB729" href="mat_note.htm#fn729"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full. 
<bqverse 38>38  Not counting children and women,<a name="fnB730" href="mat_note.htm#fn730"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> there were four thousand men who ate.<a name="fnB731" href="mat_note.htm#fn731"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 39>39  After sending away the crowd, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.<a name="fnB732" href="mat_note.htm#fn732"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>The Demand for a Sign </i>

<p><i>The Yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees </i>

<bqverse 5>5  When the disciples went to the other side, they forgot to take bread. 
<bqverse 6>6  "Watch out," Jesus said to them, "beware of the yeast of the Pharisees<a name="fnB741" href="mat_note.htm#fn741"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> and Sadducees."<a name="fnB742" href="mat_note.htm#fn742"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 14>14  They answered, "Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah,<a name="fnB749" href="mat_note.htm#fn749"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
<bqverse 15>15  He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"

<p><i>The Transfiguration </i>
<p><A NAME="17"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> And after six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John the brother of James,<a name="fnB771" href="mat_note.htm#fn771"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> and led them privately up a high mountain. 
<bqverse 2>2  And he was transfigured before them.<a name="fnB772" href="mat_note.htm#fn772"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> His<a name="fnB773" href="mat_note.htm#fn773"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.
<bqverse 3>3  Then Moses<a name="fnB774" href="mat_note.htm#fn774"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> and Elijah<a name="fnB775" href="mat_note.htm#fn775"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> also appeared before them, talking with him. 
<bqverse 4>4  So<a name="fnB776" href="mat_note.htm#fn776"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> Peter said<a name="fnB777" href="mat_note.htm#fn777"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, I will make three shelters<a name="fnB778" href="mat_note.htm#fn778"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a>--one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." 
<bqverse 5>5  While he was still speaking, a<a name="fnB779" href="mat_note.htm#fn779"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> bright cloud<a name="fnB780" href="mat_note.htm#fn780"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> overshadowed<a name="fnB781" href="mat_note.htm#fn781"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> them, and a voice from the cloud said,<a name="fnB782" href="mat_note.htm#fn782"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> "This is my one dear Son,<a name="fnB783" href="mat_note.htm#fn783"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> in whom I take great delight. Listen to him!"<a name="fnB784" href="mat_note.htm#fn784"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  When the disciples heard this, they were overwhelmed with fear and threw themselves down with their faces to the ground.<a name="fnB785" href="mat_note.htm#fn785"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  But Jesus came and touched them. "Get up," he said. "Do not be afraid." 
<bqverse 8>8  When<a name="fnB786" href="mat_note.htm#fn786"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> they looked up, all they saw was Jesus alone.<p>

<bqverse 9>9  As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them,<a name="fnB787" href="mat_note.htm#fn787"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> "Do not tell anyone about the vision until the Son of Man is raised from the dead." 
<bqverse 10>10 The disciples asked him,<a name="fnB788" href="mat_note.htm#fn788"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> "Why then do the experts in the law<a name="fnB789" href="mat_note.htm#fn789"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> say that Elijah must come first?" 
<bqverse 11>11  He<a name="fnB790" href="mat_note.htm#fn790"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> answered, "Elijah does indeed come first and will restore all things. 
<bqverse 12>12  And I tell you that Elijah has already come. Yet they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted. In<a name="fnB791" href="mat_note.htm#fn791"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> the same way, the Son of Man will suffer at their hands." 
<bqverse 13>13  Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist.<a name="_Toc432264707"></a><a name="_Toc485059647"></a><a name="_Toc494013144"></a></p>
<p><i>The Disciples' Failure to Heal </i>
<p>
<bqverse 14>14  When<a name="fnB792" href="mat_note.htm#fn792"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> they came to the crowd, a man came to him, knelt before him, 
<bqverse 15>15  and said, "Lord, have mercy on my son, because he is epileptic<a name="fnB793" href="mat_note.htm#fn793"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> and suffers terribly, for he often falls into the fire and into the water. 
<bqverse 16>16  I brought him to your disciples, but<a name="fnB794" href="mat_note.htm#fn794"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> they were not able to heal him." 
<bqverse 17>17  Jesus answered,<a name="fnB795" href="mat_note.htm#fn795"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> "You<a name="fnB796" href="mat_note.htm#fn796"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> unbelieving<a name="fnB797" href="mat_note.htm#fn797"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> and perverse generation!

<bqverse 18>18  Then<a name="fnB801" href="mat_note.htm#fn801"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> Jesus rebuked<a name="fnB802" href="mat_note.htm#fn802"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> the demon and it came out of him, and the boy was healed from that moment. 
<bqverse 19>19  Then the disciples came<a name="fnB803" href="mat_note.htm#fn803"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> to Jesus privately and said, "Why couldn't we cast it out?" 
<bqverse 20>20  He told them, "It was because of your little faith.

<bqverse 25>25  He said, "Yes."

<bqverse 26>26  After he said, "From foreigners," Jesus said to him, "Then the sons<a name="fnB813" href="mat_note.htm#fn813"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> are free.

<bqverse 24>24  As<a name="fnB847" href="mat_note.htm#fn847"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> he began settling his accounts, a man who owed ten thousand talents<a name="fnB848" href="mat_note.htm#fn848"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> was brought to him.
<bqverse 25>25  Because<a name="fnB849" href="mat_note.htm#fn849"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> he was not able to repay, the lord ordered him to be sold, along with<a name="fnB850" href="mat_note.htm#fn850"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> his wife, children and whatever he possessed, and repayment to be made. 
<bqverse 26>26  Then the slave threw himself to the ground<a name="fnB851" href="mat_note.htm#fn851"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> before him, saying, `Be patient with me, and I will repay you everything.' 
<bqverse 27>27  The lord had compassion on that slave and released him, and forgave him the debt. 
<bqverse 28>28  After<a name="fnB852" href="mat_note.htm#fn852"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> he went out, that same slave found one of his fellow slaves who owed him one hundred silver coins;<a name="fnB853" href="mat_note.htm#fn853"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> then<a name="fnB854" href="mat_note.htm#fn854"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> he grabbed him by the throat and started to choke him,<a name="fnB855" href="mat_note.htm#fn855"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> saying, `Pay back what you owe!' 
<bqverse 29>29 Then his fellow slave threw himself down and begged him,<a name="fnB856" href="mat_note.htm#fn856"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> `Be patient with me, and I will repay you.' 
<bqverse 30>30  But he refused. Instead, he went out and threw him in prison until he repaid the debt. 
<bqverse 31>31  When<a name="fnB857" href="mat_note.htm#fn857"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were very upset and went and told their lord everything that had happened.
<bqverse 32>32  Then his lord called the first slave<a name="fnB858" href="mat_note.htm#fn858"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> and said to him, `Evil slave! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me! 
<bqverse 33>33  Should you not have shown mercy to your fellow slave, just as I showed it to you?' 
<bqverse 34>34  And in anger his lord turned him over to the prison guards to torture him<a name="fnB859" href="mat_note.htm#fn859"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> until he repaid all he owed.

<bqverse 17>17  He said to him, "Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments." 
<bqverse 18>18  "Which ones?" he asked. Jesus replied, "<b><i>Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false witness,</i>

<bqverse 13>13  And he said to them, "It is written, `<b><i>My house will be called a house of prayer,</i></b>'<a name="fnB967" href="mat_note.htm#fn967"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> but you are turning it into <b><i>a den</i></b><a name="fnB968" href="mat_note.htm#fn968"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> of robbers</i></b>!"<a name="fnB969" href="mat_note.htm#fn969"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a><p>
 
<bqverse 14>14 The blind and lame came to him in the temple courts, and he healed them. 
<bqverse 15>15  But when the chief priests and the experts in the law<a name="fnB970" href="mat_note.htm#fn970"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> saw the wonderful things he did and heard the children crying out in the temple courts,<a name="fnB971" href="mat_note.htm#fn971"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> "Hosanna to the Son of David," they became indignant 
<bqverse 16>16  and said to him, "Do you hear what they are saying?" Jesus said to them, "Yes. Have you never read, `<b><i>Out of the mouths of children and nursing infants you have prepared praise for yourself</i></b>'?"<a name="fnB972" href="mat_note.htm#fn972"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  And leaving them, he went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there.<a name="_Toc403221374"></a><a name="_Toc416893862"></a><a name="_Toc432264723"></a><a name="_Toc485059663"></a><a name="_Toc494013160"></a></p>
<p><i>The Withered Fig Tree</i>
<p>
<bqverse 18>18 Now early in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry. 
<bqverse 19>19  After noticing a fig tree<a name="fnB973" href="mat_note.htm#fn973"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> by the road he went to it, but found nothing on it except leaves. He said to it, "Never again will there be fruit from you!" And the fig tree withered at once. 
<bqverse 20>20 When the disciples saw it they were amazed, saying, "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?" 
<bqverse 21>21  Jesus<a name="fnB974" href="mat_note.htm#fn974"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> answered them, "I tell you the truth,<a name="fnB975" href="mat_note.htm#fn975"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, `Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,' it will happen.
<bqverse 22>22  And whatever you ask in prayer, if you believe,<a name="fnB976" href="mat_note.htm#fn976"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> you will receive."<a name="_Toc403221375"></a><a name="_Toc416893863"></a><a name="_Toc432264724"></a><a name="_Toc485059664"></a><a name="_Toc494013161"></a></p>
<p><i>The Authority of Jesus </i>
<p>
<bqverse 23>23  Now after Jesus<a name="fnB977" href="mat_note.htm#fn977"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> entered the temple courts,<a name="fnB978" href="mat_note.htm#fn978"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> the chief priests and elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching and said, "By what authority<a name="fnB979" href="mat_note.htm#fn979"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?" 
<bqverse 24>24  Jesus<a name="fnB980" href="mat_note.htm#fn980"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> answered them, "I will also ask you one question. If you answer me then I will also tell you by what authority I do these things. 
<bqverse 25>25  Where did John's baptism come from? From heaven or from men?"<a name="fnB981" href="mat_note.htm#fn981"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> They discussed this among themselves, saying, "If we say, `From heaven,' he will say, `Then why did you not believe him?' 
<bqverse 26>26  But if we say, `From men,' we fear the crowd, for they all consider John to be a prophet." 
<bqverse 27>27  So<a name="fnB982" href="mat_note.htm#fn982"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> they answered Jesus,<a name="fnB983" href="mat_note.htm#fn983"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> "We don't know."<a name="fnB984" href="mat_note.htm#fn984"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> Then he said to them, "Neither will I tell you<a name="fnB985" href="mat_note.htm#fn985"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> by what authority<a name="fnB986" href="mat_note.htm#fn986"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> I am doing these things.<a name="_Toc403221376"></a><a name="_Toc416893864"></a><a name="_Toc432264725"></a><a name="_Toc485059665"></a><a name="_Toc494013162"></a></p>
<p><i>The Parable of the Two Sons</i>
<p>
<bqverse 28>28  "What<a name="fnB987" href="mat_note.htm#fn987"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, `Son, go and work in the vineyard today.' 
<bqverse 29>29  The boy answered,<a name="fnB988" href="mat_note.htm#fn988"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> `I will not.' But later he had a change of heart<a name="fnB989" href="mat_note.htm#fn989"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> and went. 
<bqverse 30>30  The father<a name="fnB990" href="mat_note.htm#fn990"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> went to the other son and said the same thing.

<bqverse 31>31 Which of the two did his father's will?"

<p><i>The Parable of the Tenants </i>
<p>
<bqverse 33>33  "Listen to another parable: There was a landowner<a name="fnB997" href="mat_note.htm#fn997"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> who planted a vineyard.<a name="fnB998" href="mat_note.htm#fn998"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> He put a fence around it, dug a pit for its winepress, and built a watchtower. Then<a name="fnB999" href="mat_note.htm#fn999"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> he leased it to tenant farmers<a name="fnB1000" href="mat_note.htm#fn1000"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> and went on a journey.
<bqverse 34>34  When the harvest time was near, he sent his slaves<a name="fnB1001" href="mat_note.htm#fn1001"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> to the tenants to collect his portion of the crop.<a name="fnB1002" href="mat_note.htm#fn1002"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 35>35  But the tenants seized his slaves, beat one,<a name="fnB1003" href="mat_note.htm#fn1003"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> killed another, and stoned another. 
<bqverse 36>36  Again he sent other slaves, more than the first, and they treated them the same way. 
<bqverse 37>37  Finally he sent his son to them,<a name="fnB1004" href="mat_note.htm#fn1004"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> saying, `They will respect my son.' 
<bqverse 38>38  But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, `This is the heir. Come, let's kill him and get his inheritance!' 
<bqverse 39>39 So<a name="fnB1005" href="mat_note.htm#fn1005"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> they seized him,<a name="fnB1006" href="mat_note.htm#fn1006"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> threw him out of the vineyard,<a name="fnB1007" href="mat_note.htm#fn1007"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> and killed him. 
<bqverse 40>40  Now when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?" 
<bqverse 41>41  They said to him, "He will utterly destroy those evil men! Then he will lease the vineyard to other tenants who will give him his portion at the harvest." <p>

<bqverse 42>42  Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the scriptures: </p>
<br><b><i>`<b><i>The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone</i></b><i>.</i><a name="fnB1008" href="mat_note.htm#fn1008"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> </i></b><br>

<bqverse 46>46  They wanted to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowds, because they regarded him as a prophet.

<p><i>The Parable of the Wedding Banquet </i>
<p><A NAME="22"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Jesus spoke<a name="fnB1014" href="mat_note.htm#fn1014"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> to them again in parables, saying:
<bqverse 2>2  "The kingdom of heaven can be compared to a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son. 
<bqverse 3>3  He sent his slaves<a name="fnB1015" href="mat_note.htm#fn1015"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> to summon those who had been invited to the banquet, but they would not come. 
<bqverse 4>4  Again he sent other slaves, saying, `Tell those who have been invited, "Look!

Come to the wedding banquet."' 
<bqverse 5>5  But they were indifferent and went away, one to his farm, another to his business. 
<bqverse 6>6  The<a name="fnB1017" href="mat_note.htm#fn1017"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> rest seized his slaves, insolently mistreated them, and killed them. 
<bqverse 7>7  The<a name="fnB1018" href="mat_note.htm#fn1018"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> king was furious! He sent his soldiers who put those murderers to death<a name="fnB1019" href="mat_note.htm#fn1019"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> and set their town<a name="fnB1020" href="mat_note.htm#fn1020"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> on fire. 
<bqverse 8>8  Then he said to his slaves, `The wedding is ready, but the ones who had been invited were not worthy. 
<bqverse 9>9  So go into the main streets and invite everyone you find to the wedding banquet.' 
<bqverse 10>10  And those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all they found, both bad and good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. 
<bqverse 11>11 But when the king came in to see the wedding guests, he saw a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. 
<bqverse 12>12  And he said to him, `Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' But he had nothing to say.<a name="fnB1021" href="mat_note.htm#fn1021"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  Then the king said to his attendants, `Tie him up hand and foot and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!'

<p><i>Paying Taxes to Caesar </i>
<p>
<bqverse 15>15  Then the Pharisees<a name="fnB1022" href="mat_note.htm#fn1022"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> went out and planned together to entrap him with his own words.<a name="fnB1023" href="mat_note.htm#fn1023"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians,<a name="fnB1024" href="mat_note.htm#fn1024"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> saying, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful, and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.<a name="fnB1025" href="mat_note.htm#fn1025"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> You<a name="fnB1026" href="mat_note.htm#fn1026"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> do not court anyone's favor because you show no partiality.<a name="fnB1027" href="mat_note.htm#fn1027"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  Tell us then, what do you think? Is it right<a name="fnB1028" href="mat_note.htm#fn1028"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> to pay taxes<a name="fnB1029" href="mat_note.htm#fn1029"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> to Caesar<a name="fnB1030" href="mat_note.htm#fn1030"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> or not?"<p>

<bqverse 18>18  But Jesus realized their evil intentions and said, "Hypocrites! Why are you testing me? 
<bqverse 19>19 Show me the coin used for the tax." So<a name="fnB1031" href="mat_note.htm#fn1031"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> they brought him a denarius.<a name="fnB1032" href="mat_note.htm#fn1032"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  Jesus<a name="fnB1033" href="mat_note.htm#fn1033"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> said to them, "Whose likeness<a name="fnB1034" href="mat_note.htm#fn1034"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> is this and whose inscription?" 
<bqverse 21>21  They replied,<a name="fnB1035" href="mat_note.htm#fn1035"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> "Caesar's."

<bqverse 22>22  Now when they heard this they were stunned,<a name="fnB1038" href="mat_note.htm#fn1038"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> and they left him and went away.<a name="_Toc403221380"></a><a name="_Toc416893868"></a><a name="_Toc432264729"></a><a name="_Toc485059669"></a><a name="_Toc494013166"></a></p>
<p><i>Marriage and the Resurrection </i>

<bqverse 23>23  The same day Sadducees<a name="fnB1039" href="mat_note.htm#fn1039"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> (who say there is no resurrection)<a name="fnB1040" href="mat_note.htm#fn1040"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> came to him.

<bqverse 24>24  "Teacher, Moses said, `<b><i>If a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and have children</i></b><a name="fnB1041" href="mat_note.htm#fn1041"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> <b><i>for his brother</i></b>.'<a name="fnB1042" href="mat_note.htm#fn1042"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 29>29 Jesus<a name="fnB1045" href="mat_note.htm#fn1045"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> answered them, "You are deceived, because you don't know the scriptures or the power of God. 
<bqverse 30>30  For in the resurrection, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels<a name="fnB1046" href="mat_note.htm#fn1046"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> in heaven.

<p><i>The Passover </i>
<p>
<bqverse 17>17  Now on the first day of the feast of<a name="fnB1247" href="mat_note.htm#fn1247"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus and said,<a name="fnB1248" href="mat_note.htm#fn1248"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"<a name="fnB1249" href="mat_note.htm#fn1249"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  He<a name="fnB1250" href="mat_note.htm#fn1250"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> said, "Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, `The Teacher says, "My time is near. I will observe the Passover with my disciples at your house."'" 
<bqverse 19>19  So<a name="fnB1251" href="mat_note.htm#fn1251"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> the disciples did as Jesus had instructed them, and they prepared the Passover. 
<bqverse 20>20  When<a name="fnB1252" href="mat_note.htm#fn1252"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> it was evening, he took his place at the table<a name="fnB1253" href="mat_note.htm#fn1253"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> with the twelve.
<bqverse 21>21 And while they were eating he said, "I tell you the truth,<a name="fnB1254" href="mat_note.htm#fn1254"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> one of you will betray me."<a name="fnB1255" href="mat_note.htm#fn1255"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  They<a name="fnB1256" href="mat_note.htm#fn1256"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> became greatly distressed<a name="fnB1257" href="mat_note.htm#fn1257"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> and each one began to say to him, "Surely not I, Lord?"
<bqverse 23>23  He<a name="fnB1258" href="mat_note.htm#fn1258"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> answered, "The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me<a name="fnB1259" href="mat_note.htm#fn1259"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> will betray me. 
<bqverse 24>24  The Son of Man will go as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for him if he had never been born." 
<bqverse 25>25  Then<a name="fnB1260" href="mat_note.htm#fn1260"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> Judas, the one who would betray him, said, "Surely not I, Rabbi?"

<bqverse 26>26  While<a name="fnB1262" href="mat_note.htm#fn1262"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after giving thanks he broke it, gave it to his disciples, and said, "Take, eat, this is my body." 
<bqverse 27>27  And after taking the cup and giving thanks, he gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you, 
<bqverse 28>28  for this is my blood, the blood<a name="fnB1263" href="mat_note.htm#fn1263"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> of the covenant,<a name="fnB1264" href="mat_note.htm#fn1264"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> that is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.

<p><i>The Prediction of Peter</i>'<i>s Denial</i>
<p>
<bqverse 31>31  Then Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away because of me this night, for it is written: </p>
<br><b><i>`<b><i>I will strike the shepherd,</i></b><br>

<bqverse 32>32  But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee." 
<bqverse 33>33  Peter<a name="fnB1270" href="mat_note.htm#fn1270"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> said to him, "If they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away!" 
<bqverse 34>34 Jesus said to him, "I tell you the truth,<a name="fnB1271" href="mat_note.htm#fn1271"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> on this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." 
<bqverse 35>35  Peter said to him, "Even if I must die with you, I will never deny you." And all the disciples said the same thing.<a name="_Toc403221402"></a><a name="_Toc416893890"></a><a name="_Toc432264751"></a><a name="_Toc485059691"></a><a name="_Toc494013188"></a></p>
<p><i>Gethsemane </i>
<p>
<bqverse 36>36  Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples, "Sit here while I go over there and pray." 
<bqverse 37>37  He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and became anguished and distressed. 
<bqverse 38>38  Then he said to them, "My soul is deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake with me." 
<bqverse 39>39  Going a little farther, he threw himself down with his face to the ground and prayed,<a name="fnB1272" href="mat_note.htm#fn1272"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> "My Father, if possible,<a name="fnB1273" href="mat_note.htm#fn1273"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> let this cup pass from me! Yet not what I will, but what you will." 
<bqverse 40>40  Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. He<a name="fnB1274" href="mat_note.htm#fn1274"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> said to Peter, "So, couldn't you stay awake with me for one hour? 
<bqverse 41>41  Stay awake and pray that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." 
<bqverse 42>42  He went away a second time and prayed,<a name="fnB1275" href="mat_note.htm#fn1275"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> "My Father, if this cup<a name="fnB1276" href="mat_note.htm#fn1276"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> cannot be taken away unless I drink it, your will must be done." 
<bqverse 43>43  He came again and found them sleeping; they could not keep their eyes open.<a name="fnB1277" href="mat_note.htm#fn1277"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 44>44  So leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same thing once more. 
<bqverse 45>45  Then he came to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is approaching, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 
<bqverse 46>46  Get up, let us go. Look! My betrayer<a name="fnB1278" href="mat_note.htm#fn1278"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> is approaching!"<a name="_Toc403221403"></a><a name="_Toc416893891"></a><a name="_Toc432264752"></a><a name="_Toc485059692"></a><a name="_Toc494013189"></a></p>
<p><i>Betrayal and Arrest </i>
<p>
<bqverse 47>47  While he was still speaking, Judas,<a name="fnB1279" href="mat_note.htm#fn1279"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> one of the twelve, came. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, and sent by the chief priests and elders of the people.
<bqverse 48>48  (Now the betrayer<a name="fnB1280" href="mat_note.htm#fn1280"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> had given them a sign, saying, "The one I kiss is the man.<a name="fnB1281" href="mat_note.htm#fn1281"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> Arrest him!")<a name="fnB1282" href="mat_note.htm#fn1282"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 49>49 Immediately<a name="fnB1283" href="mat_note.htm#fn1283"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> he came to Jesus and said, "Greetings, Rabbi," and kissed him.<a name="fnB1284" href="mat_note.htm#fn1284"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 50>50  Jesus<a name="fnB1285" href="mat_note.htm#fn1285"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> said to him, "Friend, do what you are here to do." Then they came and took hold<a name="fnB1286" href="mat_note.htm#fn1286"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> of Jesus and arrested him. 
<bqverse 51>51  But<a name="fnB1287" href="mat_note.htm#fn1287"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> one of those with Jesus grabbed<a name="fnB1288" href="mat_note.htm#fn1288"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> his sword, drew it out, and struck the high priest's slave,<a name="fnB1289" href="mat_note.htm#fn1289"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> cutting off his ear.
<bqverse 52>52  Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place!<a name="fnB1290" href="mat_note.htm#fn1290"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> For all who take hold of the sword will die by the sword. 
<bqverse 53>53  Or do you think that I cannot call on my Father, and that he would send me more than twelve legions<a name="fnB1291" href="mat_note.htm#fn1291"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> of angels right now? 
<bqverse 54>54  How then would the scriptures that say it must happen this way be fulfilled?" 
<bqverse 55>55  At that moment Jesus said to the crowd, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me like you would an outlaw?<a name="fnB1292" href="mat_note.htm#fn1292"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> Day after day I sat teaching in the temple courts, yet<a name="fnB1293" href="mat_note.htm#fn1293"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> you did not arrest me. 
<bqverse 56>56  But this has happened so that<a name="fnB1294" href="mat_note.htm#fn1294"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a> the scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled.<a name="_Toc403221404"></a><a name="_Toc416893892"></a><a name="_Toc432264753"></a><a name="_Toc485059693"></a><a name="_Toc494013190"></a></p>
<p><i>Condemned by the Sanhedrin </i>
<p>
<bqverse 57>57  Now the ones who had arrested Jesus led him to Caiaphas, the high priest, in whose house<a name="fnB1295" href="mat_note.htm#fn1295"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> the experts in the law<a name="fnB1296" href="mat_note.htm#fn1296"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a> and the elders had gathered. 
<bqverse 58>58  But Peter was following him from a distance, all the way to the courtyard of the high priest. After<a name="fnB1297" href="mat_note.htm#fn1297"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>69</SUP></FONT></a> going in, he sat with the guards<a name="fnB1298" href="mat_note.htm#fn1298"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>70</SUP></FONT></a> to see the outcome. 
<bqverse 59>59  The<a name="fnB1299" href="mat_note.htm#fn1299"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>71</SUP></FONT></a> chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were trying to find false testimony against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
<bqverse 60>60  But they did not find anything, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally<a name="fnB1300" href="mat_note.htm#fn1300"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>72</SUP></FONT></a> two came forward
<bqverse 61>61  and declared, "This man<a name="fnB1301" href="mat_note.htm#fn1301"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>73</SUP></FONT></a> said, `I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'" 
<bqverse 62>62  So<a name="fnB1302" href="mat_note.htm#fn1302"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>74</SUP></FONT></a> the high priest stood up and said to him, "Have you no answer? What is this that they are testifying against you?" 
<bqverse 63>63  But Jesus was silent. The<a name="fnB1303" href="mat_note.htm#fn1303"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>75</SUP></FONT></a> high priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ,<a name="fnB1304" href="mat_note.htm#fn1304"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>76</SUP></FONT></a> the Son of God." 
<bqverse 64>64  Jesus said to him, "You have said it yourself. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man <i>sitting at the right hand</i><a name="fnB1305" href="mat_note.htm#fn1305"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>77</SUP></FONT></a> of the Power<a name="fnB1306" href="mat_note.htm#fn1306"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>78</SUP></FONT></a> and <i>coming on the clouds of heaven</i>."<a name="fnB1307" href="mat_note.htm#fn1307"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>79</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 65>65  Then the high priest tore his clothes and declared,<a name="fnB1308" href="mat_note.htm#fn1308"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>80</SUP></FONT></a> "He has blasphemed! Why do we still need witnesses? Now<a name="fnB1309" href="mat_note.htm#fn1309"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>81</SUP></FONT></a> you have heard the blasphemy! 
<bqverse 66>66  What is your verdict?"<a name="fnB1310" href="mat_note.htm#fn1310"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>82</SUP></FONT></a> They<a name="fnB1311" href="mat_note.htm#fn1311"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>83</SUP></FONT></a> answered, "He is guilty and deserves<a name="fnB1312" href="mat_note.htm#fn1312"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>84</SUP></FONT></a> death." 
<bqverse 67>67  Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists. And some slapped him, 
<bqverse 68>68  saying, "Prophesy for us, you Christ!<a name="fnB1313" href="mat_note.htm#fn1313"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>85</SUP></FONT></a> Who hit you?<a name="fnB1314" href="mat_note.htm#fn1314"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>86</SUP></FONT></a>"<a name="_Toc403221405"></a><a name="_Toc416893893"></a><a name="_Toc485059694"></a><a name="_Toc494013191"></a></p>
<p><i>Peter</i>'<i>s Denials </i>

<bqverse 69>69  Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard.

<bqverse 70>70  But he denied it in front of them all:<a name="fnB1317" href="mat_note.htm#fn1317"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>89</SUP></FONT></a> "I don't know what you are talking about."

<bqverse 72>72  He denied it again with an oath, "I do not know the man."
<bqverse 73>73  After<a name="fnB1320" href="mat_note.htm#fn1320"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>92</SUP></FONT></a> a little while, those standing there came up to Peter and said, "You really are one of them too; even your accent<a name="fnB1321" href="mat_note.htm#fn1321"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>93</SUP></FONT></a> gives you away!" 
<bqverse 74>74  At that he began to curse, and he swore with an oath, "I do not know the man!" At that moment a rooster crowed. 
<bqverse 75>75  Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.<a name="fnB1322" href="mat_note.htm#fn1322"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>94</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 11>11  Then<a name="fnB1334" href="mat_note.htm#fn1334"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him,<a name="fnB1335" href="mat_note.htm#fn1335"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> "Are you the king<a name="fnB1336" href="mat_note.htm#fn1336"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> of the Jews?" Jesus<a name="fnB1337" href="mat_note.htm#fn1337"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> said, "You say so."<a name="fnB1338" href="mat_note.htm#fn1338"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  But when he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he did not respond. 
<bqverse 13>13  Then Pilate said to him, "Don't you hear how many charges they are bringing against you?" 
<bqverse 14>14  But he did not answer even one accusation, so that the governor was quite amazed.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  During the feast the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd,<a name="fnB1339" href="mat_note.htm#fn1339"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> whomever they wanted. 
<bqverse 16>16  At that time they had in custody a notorious prisoner named Jesus<a name="fnB1340" href="mat_note.htm#fn1340"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> Barabbas. 
<bqverse 17>17  So after they had assembled, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you, Jesus<a name="fnB1341" href="mat_note.htm#fn1341"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Christ?"<a name="fnB1342" href="mat_note.htm#fn1342"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  (For he knew that they had handed him over because of envy.)<a name="fnB1343" href="mat_note.htm#fn1343"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  As<a name="fnB1344" href="mat_note.htm#fn1344"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> he was sitting on the judgment seat,<a name="fnB1345" href="mat_note.htm#fn1345"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> his wife sent a message<a name="fnB1346" href="mat_note.htm#fn1346"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> to him:<a name="fnB1347" href="mat_note.htm#fn1347"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> "Have nothing to do with that innocent man;<a name="fnB1348" href="mat_note.htm#fn1348"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> I have suffered greatly as a result of a dream<a name="fnB1349" href="mat_note.htm#fn1349"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> about him today." 
<bqverse 20>20  But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed.
<bqverse 21>21  The<a name="fnB1350" href="mat_note.htm#fn1350"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> governor asked them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" And they said, "Barabbas!" 
<bqverse 22>22  Pilate said to them, "Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Christ?"<a name="fnB1351" href="mat_note.htm#fn1351"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> They all said, "Crucify him!"<a name="fnB1352" href="mat_note.htm#fn1352"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23  He asked, "Why? What wrong has he done?" But they shouted more insistently, "Crucify him!"<a name="_Toc403221410"></a><a name="_Toc416893898"></a><a name="_Toc432264758"></a><a name="_Toc485059698"></a><a name="_Toc494013195"></a></p>

<bqverse 24>24  When<a name="fnB1353" href="mat_note.htm#fn1353"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> Pilate saw that he could do nothing, but that instead a riot was starting, he took some water, washed his hands before the crowd and said, "I am innocent of this man's blood. You take care of it yourselves!"<a name="fnB1354" href="mat_note.htm#fn1354"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  In<a name="fnB1355" href="mat_note.htm#fn1355"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> reply all the people said, "Let his blood be on us and on our children!" 
<bqverse 26>26  Then he released Barabbas for them. But after he had Jesus flogged<a name="fnB1356" href="mat_note.htm#fn1356"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> he handed him over<a name="fnB1357" href="mat_note.htm#fn1357"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> to be crucified.<a name="fnB1358" href="mat_note.htm#fn1358"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27 Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the governor's residence<a name="fnB1359" href="mat_note.htm#fn1359"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> and gathered the whole cohort<a name="fnB1360" href="mat_note.htm#fn1360"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> around him. 
<bqverse 28>28 They<a name="fnB1361" href="mat_note.htm#fn1361"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> stripped him and put a scarlet robe<a name="fnB1362" href="mat_note.htm#fn1362"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> around him, 
<bqverse 29>29  and after braiding<a name="fnB1363" href="mat_note.htm#fn1363"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> a crown of thorns,<a name="fnB1364" href="mat_note.htm#fn1364"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> they put it on his head.

<bqverse 30>30  They<a name="fnB1369" href="mat_note.htm#fn1369"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> spat on him and took the staff<a name="fnB1370" href="mat_note.htm#fn1370"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> and struck him repeatedly<a name="fnB1371" href="mat_note.htm#fn1371"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> on the head.

<bqverse 33>33 They<a name="fnB1376" href="mat_note.htm#fn1376"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> came to a place called Golgotha<a name="fnB1377" href="mat_note.htm#fn1377"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> (which means "Place of the Skull")<a name="fnB1378" href="mat_note.htm#fn1378"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 34>34  and offered Jesus<a name="fnB1379" href="mat_note.htm#fn1379"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> wine mixed with gall to drink.<a name="fnB1380" href="mat_note.htm#fn1380"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> But after tasting it, he would not drink it. 
<bqverse 35>35  When<a name="fnB1381" href="mat_note.htm#fn1381"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> they had crucified<a name="fnB1382" href="mat_note.htm#fn1382"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> him, they divided his clothes by throwing dice.<a name="fnB1383" href="mat_note.htm#fn1383"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 36>36  Then they sat down and kept guard over him there. 
<bqverse 37>37  Above<a name="fnB1384" href="mat_note.htm#fn1384"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> his head they put the charge against him,<a name="fnB1385" href="mat_note.htm#fn1385"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> which read:<a name="fnB1386" href="mat_note.htm#fn1386"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> "This is Jesus, the king of the Jews." 
<bqverse 38>38 Then two outlaws were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.

<bqverse 49>49  But the rest said, "Leave him alone! Let's see if Elijah will come to save him." 
<bqverse 50>50  Then Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up his spirit.

<bqverse 11>11  While<a name="fnB1439" href="mat_note.htm#fn1439"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> they were going, some<a name="fnB1440" href="mat_note.htm#fn1440"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened. 
<bqverse 12>12  After<a name="fnB1441" href="mat_note.htm#fn1441"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> they had assembled with the elders and formed a plan, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, 
<bqverse 13>13  telling them, "You are to say, `His disciples came at night and stole his body<a name="fnB1442" href="mat_note.htm#fn1442"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> while we were asleep.' 
<bqverse 14>14  If<a name="fnB1443" href="mat_note.htm#fn1443"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> this matter is heard before the governor,<a name="fnB1444" href="mat_note.htm#fn1444"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> we will satisfy him<a name="fnB1445" href="mat_note.htm#fn1445"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and keep you out of trouble."<a name="fnB1446" href="mat_note.htm#fn1446"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  So they took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story is told among the Jews to this day.<a name="fnB1447" href="mat_note.htm#fn1447"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc403221417"></a><a name="_Toc416893905"></a><a name="_Toc432264765"></a><a name="_Toc485059705"></a><a name="_Toc494013202"></a></p>
