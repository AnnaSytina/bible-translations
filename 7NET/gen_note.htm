 <b>tn</b> (1:1)  The translation assumes that the form translated "beginning" is in the absolute state rather than the construct ("in the beginning of," or "when God created"). In other words, the clause in v. 1 is a main clause, v. 2 has three clauses that are descriptive and supply background information, and v. 3 begins the narrative sequence proper. The referent of the word "beginning" has to be defined from the context since there is no beginning or ending with God.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:1)  <i>In the beginning</i>. The verse refers to the beginning of the world as we know it; it affirms that it is entirely the product of the creation of God. But there are two ways that this verse can be interpreted: (1) It may be taken to refer to the original act of creation with the rest of the events on the days of creation completing it. This would mean that the disjunctive clauses of v. 2 break the sequence of the creative work of the first day. (2) It may be taken as a summary statement of what the chapter will record, that is, vv. 3-31 are about God's creating the world as we know it. If the first view is adopted, then we have a reference here to original creation; if the second view is taken, then Genesis itself does not account for the original creation of matter. To follow this view does not deny that the Bible teaches that God created everything out of nothing (cf. John 1:3)--it simply says that Genesis is not making that affirmation. This second view presupposes the existence of pre-existent matter, when God said, "Let there be light." The first view includes the description of the primordial state as part of the events of day one. The following narrative strongly favors the second view, for the "heavens/sky" did not exist prior to the second day of creation (see v. 8) and "earth/dry land" did not exist, at least as we know it, prior to the third day of creation (see v. 10).<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="gen.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:1)  <i>God</i>. This frequently used Hebrew name for God (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a$Oh!&lt;</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yh!Oa$</FONT>]) is a plural form. When it refers to the one true God, the singular verb is normally used, as here. The plural form indicates majesty; the name stresses God's sovereignty and incomparability--he is the "God of gods." <br>
 <a name="fn2" href="gen.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  The English verb "create" captures well the meaning of the Hebrew term in this context. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ar&#180;B*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">B*r*a</FONT>) always describes the divine activity of fashioning something new, fresh, and perfect. The verb does not necessary describe creation out of nothing (see, for example, v. 27, where it refers to the creation of man); it often stresses forming anew, reforming, renewing (see Ps 51:10; Isa 43:15, 65:17).<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="gen.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  Or "the entire universe." This phrase is often interpreted as a merism, referring to the entire ordered universe, including the heavens and the earth and everything in them. The "heavens and the earth" were completed in seven days (see Gen 2:1) and are characterized by fixed laws (see Jer 33:25). Another option is to translate "the sky and the dry land." "Heavens" refers specifically to the sky, created on the second day (see v. 8), while "earth" refers specifically to the dry land, created on the third day (see v. 10). Both are distinct from the sea/seas (see v. 10 and Exod 20:11). <br>
 <a name="fn4" href="gen.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  The disjunctive clause (conjunction + subject + verb) at the beginning of v. 2 gives background information for the following narrative, explaining the state of things when "God said..." (v. 3). Verse one is a title to the chapter, v. 2 provides information about the state of things when God spoke, and v. 3 begins the narrative per se with the typical narrative construction (<i>vav</i> consecutive followed by the prefixed verbal form). (This literary structure is paralleled in the second portion of the book: Gen 2:4 provides the title or summary of what follows, 2:5-6 use disjunctive clause structures to give background information for the following narrative, and 2:7 begins the narrative with the <i>vav </i>consecutive attached to a prefixed verbal form.) Some translate 1:2a "and the earth became," arguing that v. 1 describes the original creation of the earth, while v. 2 refers to a judgment that reduced it to a chaotic condition. Verses 3ff. then describe the re-creation of the earth. However, the disjunctive clause at the beginning of v. 2 cannot be translated as if it were relating the next event in a sequence. If v. 2 were sequential to v. 1, the author would have used the <i>vav</i> consecutive followed by a prefixed verbal form and the subject.<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="gen.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  That is, what we now call "the earth." The creation of the earth as we know it is described in vv. 9-10. Prior to this the substance which became the earth (= dry land) lay dormant under the water.<br>
 <a name="fn6" href="gen.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  Traditional translations have followed a more literal rendering of "waste and void." The words describe a condition that is without form and empty. What we now know as "the earth" was actually an unfilled mass covered by water and darkness. Later <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wht</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">whb</FONT>, when used in proximity, describe a situation resulting from judgment (Isa 34:11; Jer 4:23). Both prophets may be picturing judgment as the reversal of creation in which God's judgment causes the world to revert to its primordial condition. This later use of the terms has led some to conclude that Gen 1:2 presupposes the judgment of a prior world, but it is unsound method to read the later application of the imagery (in a context of judgment) back into Gen 1:2.<br>
 <a name="fn7" href="gen.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:2)  <i>Darkness</i>. The Hebrew word simply means "darkness," but in the Bible it has come to symbolize what opposes God, such as judgment (Exod. 10:21), death (Ps. 88:13), oppression (Isa. 9:1), the wicked (1 Sam. 2:9) and in general, sin. In Isaiah 45:7 it parallels "evil." It is a fitting cover for the primeval waste; but it prepares the reader for the fact that God is about to reveal himself through his works.<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="gen.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ohT=</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">T=ho&lt;</FONT>, "deep") refers to the watery deep, the salty ocean--especially the primeval ocean that surrounds and underlies the earth (see Gen 7:11).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:2)  <i>The watery deep</i>. In the Babylonian account of creation Marduk killed the goddess Tiamat (the salty sea) and used her carcass to create heaven and earth. The form of the Hebrew word for "deep" is distinct enough from the name "Tiamat" to deny direct borrowing; however, it is possible that there is a polemical stress here. Ancient Israel does not see the ocean as a powerful deity to be destroyed in creation, only a force of nature that can be controlled by God. <br>
 <a name="fn9" href="gen.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  The traditional rendering "Spirit of God" is preserved here, as opposed to a translation like "wind from/breath of God" (cf. NRSV) or "mighty wind" (cf. NEB), taking the word "God" to represent the superlative. Elsewhere in the OT the phrase refers consistently to the divine spirit that empowers and energizes individuals (see Gen 41:38; Exod 31:3; 35:31; Num 24:2; 1 Sam 10:10; 11:6; 19:20, 23; Ezek 11:24; 2 Chr 15:1; 24:20).<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="gen.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  The Hebrew verb has been translated "hovering" or "moving" (as a bird over her young, see Deut. 32:11). The Syriac cognate term means "to brood over; to incubate." How much of that sense might be attached here is hard to say, but the verb does depict the presence of the Spirit of God moving about mysteriously over the waters, presumably preparing for the acts of creation to follow. If one reads "mighty wind" (cf. NEB) then the verse describes how the powerful wind begins to blow in preparation for the creative act described in vv. 9-10. (God also used a wind to drive back the flood waters in Noah's day. See Gen 8:1.) <br>
 <a name="fn11" href="gen.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:2) <i>Heb</i> "face."<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="gen.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:2)  <i>The water</i>. The text deliberately changes now from the term for the watery deep to the general word for water. The arena is now the life-giving water and not the chaotic abyss-like deep. The change may be merely stylistic, but it may also carry some significance. The deep carries with it the sense of the abyss, chaos, darkness--in short, that which is not good for life.<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="gen.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  The prefixed verb form with the <i>vav</i> consecutive introduces the narrative sequence. Ten times in the chapter the decree of God in creation will be so expressed. For the power of the divine word in creation, see Ps 33:9, John 1:1-3, 1 Cor 8:6, and Col 1:16.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:3)  <i>God said</i>. By speaking, God brings the world into existence. The efficacious nature of the word of the LORD is a prominent theme in this chapter. It introduces the Law, the words and commandments from the LORD that must be obeyed. The ten decrees of God in this chapter anticipate the ten words in the Decalogue (Exod 20:2-17).<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="gen.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  "Let there be" is the short jussive form of the verb "to be"; the following expression "and there was" is the short preterite form of the same verb. As such, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yh!y+</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">y=h!</FONT>) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yh!y+w^</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">w^y=h!</FONT>) form a profound wordplay to express both the calling into existence and the complete fulfillment of the divine word. <br>
 <a name="fn15" href="gen.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:3)  <i>Light</i>. The Hebrew word simply means "light," but it is used often in scripture to convey the ideas of salvation, joy, knowledge, righteousness, and life. In this context one cannot ignore those connotations, for it is the antithesis of the darkness. The first thing God does is correct the darkness; without the light there is only chaos.<br>
 <a name="fn16" href="gen.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  <i>Heb</i> "And God saw the light, that it was good." The verb "saw" in this passage carries the meaning "reflected on," "surveyed," "concluded," "noted." It is a description of reflection of the mind--it is God's opinion. <br>
 <a name="fn17" href="gen.htm#fnB17"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  The Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bof</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">fob</FONT>) in this context signifies whatever enhances, promotes, produces, or is conducive for life. It is the light that God considers "good," not the darkness. Whatever is conducive to life in God's creation is good, for God himself is good, and that goodness is reflected in all of his works.<br>
 <a name="fn18" href="gen.htm#fnB18"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  The verb "separate, divide" here explains how God used the light to dispel the darkness. It did not do away with the darkness completely, but made a separation. The light came alongside the darkness, but they are mutually exclusive--a theme that will be developed in the Gospel of John (cf. John 1:5).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:4)  The idea of separation is critical to this chapter. <i>God separated</i> light from darkness, upper water from lower water, day from night, etc. The verb is important to the Law in general. In Leviticus God separates between clean and unclean, holy and profane (Lev. 10:10, 11:47 and 20:24); in Exodus God separates the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place (26:33). There is a preference for the light over the darkness, just as there will be a preference for the upper waters, the rain water which is conducive to life, over the sea water.<br>
 <a name="fn19" href="gen.htm#fnB19"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Heb </i>"he called to," meaning "he named."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:5)  <i>God called</i>. Seven times in this chapter naming or blessing follows some act of creation. There is clearly a point being made beyond the obvious idea of naming. In the Babylonian creation story <i>Enuma Elish,</i> naming is equal to creating. In the Bible the act of naming, like creating, can be an indication of sovereignty (see 2 Kgs 23:34). In this verse God is sovereign even over the darkness.<br>
 <a name="fn20" href="gen.htm#fnB20"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:5) <i>Heb</i> "and the darkness he called night." The words "he called" have not been repeated in the translation for stylistic reasons.<br>
 <a name="fn21" href="gen.htm#fnB21"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  Another option is to translate, "Evening came, and then morning came." This formula closes the six days of creation. It seems to follow the Jewish order of reckoning time: from evening to morning. Day one started with the dark, continued through the creation of light, and ended with nightfall. Another alternative would be to translate, "There was night and then there was day, one day."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:5)  <i>The first day</i>. The exegetical evidence suggests the word "day" in this chapter refers to a literal twenty-four hour day. It is true that the word can refer to a longer period of time (see Isa 61:2, or the idiom in 2:4, "in the day," that is, "when"). But this chapter uses "day," "night," "morning," "evening," "years," and "seasons." Consistency would require sorting out how all these terms could be used to express ages. Also, when the Hebrew word <i>yom</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;oy</FONT>) is used with a numerical adjective, it refers to a literal day. Furthermore, the commandment to keep the sabbath clearly favors this interpretation. One is to work for six days and then rest on the seventh, just as God did when he worked at creation. <br>
 <a name="fn22" href="gen.htm#fnB22"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  The Hebrew word refers to an expanse of air pressure between the surface of the sea and the clouds, separating water below from water above. In v. 8 it is called "sky."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:6)  <i>An expanse</i>. In the poetic texts the writers envision, among other things, something rather strong and shiny, no doubt influencing the traditional translation "firmament" (cf. NRSV "dome"). Job 37:18 refers to the skies poured out like a molten mirror. Dan 12:3 and Ezek 1:22 portray it as shiny. The sky or atmosphere may have seemed like a glass dome. For a detailed study of the Hebrew conception of the heavens and sky, see L. I. J. Stadelmann, <i>The Hebrew Conception of the World</i>, 37-60.<br>
 <a name="fn23" href="gen.htm#fnB23"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:6) <i>Heb</i> "the waters from the waters."<br>
 <a name="fn24" href="gen.htm#fnB24"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:7) <i>Heb</i> "the expanse."<br>
 <a name="fn25" href="gen.htm#fnB25"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:7) This statement indicates that it happened the way God designed it, underscoring the connection between word and event. <br>
 <a name="fn26" href="gen.htm#fnB26"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:8)  Though the Hebrew word can mean "heaven," it refers in this context to "the sky."<br>
 <a name="fn27" href="gen.htm#fnB27"><sup>28</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:9)  <i>Let the water...be gathered to one place</i>. In the beginning the water covered the whole earth; now the water was to be restricted to an area to form the ocean. The picture is one of the dry land as an island with the sea surrounding it. Again the sovereignty of God is revealed. Whereas the pagans saw the sea as a force to be reckoned with, God controls the boundaries of the sea. And in the judgment at the flood he will blur the boundaries so that chaos returns.<br>
 <a name="fn28" href="gen.htm#fnB28"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  When the waters are collected to one place, dry land emerges above the surface of the receding water.<br>
 <a name="fn29" href="gen.htm#fnB29"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:10) <i>Heb</i> "earth," but here the term refers to the dry ground as opposed to the sea.<br>
 <a name="fn30" href="gen.htm#fnB30"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  The Hebrew construction employs a cognate accusative, where the nominal object ("vegetation") derives from the verbal root employed. It stresses the abundant productivity that God created.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:11)  <i>Vegetation</i>. The Hebrew word translated "vegetation" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">av#D\</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">D#v#a</FONT>) normally means "grass," but here it probably refers more generally to vegetation that includes many of the plants and trees. In the verse the plants and the trees are qualified as self-perpetuating with seeds, but not the word "vegetation," indicating it is the general term and the other two terms are sub-categories of it. Moreover, in vv. 29 and 30 the word vegetation/grass does not appear. The Samaritan Pentateuch adds an "and" before the fruit trees, indicating it saw the arrangement as bipartite (The SP tends to eliminate asyndetic constructions). <br>
 <a name="fn31" href="gen.htm#fnB31"><sup>32</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:11)  <i>After their kinds</i>. The Hebrew word translated "kind"(<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ym!</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">m!/</FONT>) indicates again that God was concerned with defining and dividing time, space, and species. The point is that creation was with order, as opposed to chaos. And what God created and distinguished with boundaries was not to be confused (see Lev 19:19 and Deut 22:9-11). <br>
 <a name="fn32" href="gen.htm#fnB32"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  The conjunction "and" is not in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied in the translation to clarify the relationship of the clauses.<br>
 <a name="fn33" href="gen.htm#fnB33"><sup>34</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:14)  <i>Let there be lights</i>. Light itself was created before the light-bearers. The order would not seem strange to the ancient Hebrew mind that did not automatically link daylight with the sun (note that dawn and dusk appear to have light without the sun).<br>
 <a name="fn34" href="gen.htm#fnB34"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:14)  The language describing the cosmos, which reflects a pre-scientific view of the world, must be interpreted as phenomenal, describing what appears to be the case. The sun and the moon are not <i>in</i> the sky (below the clouds), but from the viewpoint of a person standing on the earth, they appear that way. Even today we use similar phenomenological expressions, such as "the sun is rising" or "the stars in the sky."<br>
 <a name="fn35" href="gen.htm#fnB35"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:14)  The text has "for signs and for seasons and for days and years." It seems likely from the meanings of the words involved that "signs" is the main idea, followed by two categories, "seasons" and "days and years." This is the simplest explanation, and one that matches vv. 11-13. It could even be rendered "signs for the fixed seasons, that is [explicative <i>vav</i>] days and years."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:14)  <i>Let them be for signs</i>. The point is that the sun and the moon were important to fix the days for the seasonal celebrations for the worshiping community.<br>
 <a name="fn36" href="gen.htm#fnB36"><sup>37</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:16)  <i>Two great lights</i>. The text goes to great length to discuss the creation of these lights, suggesting that the subject was very important to the ancients. Since these "lights" were considered deities in the ancient world, the section serves as a strong polemic (see G. Hasel, "The Polemical Nature of the Genesis Cosmology," <i>EvQ </i>46 [1974]: 81-102). The Book of Genesis is affirming they are created entities, not deities. To underscore this the text does not even give them names. If used here, the usual names for the sun and moon [<i>Shemesh </i>and <i>Yarih</i>, respectively] might have carried pagan connotations, so they are simply described as greater and lesser lights. Moreover, they serve in the capacity that God gives them, which would not be the normal function the pagans ascribed to them. They merely divide, govern, and give light in God's creation.<br>
 <a name="fn37" href="gen.htm#fnB37"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:16)  <i>Heb</i> "and the stars." Now the term "stars" is added as a third object of the verb "made." Perhaps the language is phenomenological, meaning that the stars appeared in the sky from this time forward.<br>
 <a name="fn38" href="gen.htm#fnB38"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:17)  <i>Heb</i> "them"; the referent (the lights mentioned in the preceding verses) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn39" href="gen.htm#fnB39"><sup>40</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:18)  In days one to three there is a naming by God; in days five and six there is a blessing by God. But on day four there is neither. It could be a mere stylistic variation. But it could also be a deliberate design to avoid naming "sun" and "moon" or promoting them beyond what they are, things that God made to serve in his creation.<br>
 <a name="fn40" href="gen.htm#fnB40"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:20)  The Hebrew text again uses a cognate construction ("swarm with swarms") to emphasize the abundant fertility. The idea of the verb is one of swift movement back and forth, literally swarming. This verb is used in Exod 1:7 to describe the rapid growth of the Israelite population in bondage.<br>
 <a name="fn41" href="gen.htm#fnB41"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:20)  The Hebrew text uses the Polel form of the verb instead of the simple Qal; it stresses a swarming flight again to underscore the abundant fruitfulness.<br>
 <a name="fn42" href="gen.htm#fnB42"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:21)  For the first time in the narrative proper the verb "create" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ar&#180;B*</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">B*r*a</FONT>) appears. (It is used in the summary statement of v. 1.) The author wishes to underscore that these creatures--even the great ones--are part of God's perfect creation. The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;n]yN]T^h~</FONT> (<i>tanninim</i>) is used for snakes (Exod 7:9), crocodiles (Ezek 29:3), or other powerful animals (Jer 51:34). In Isa 27:1 the word is used to describe a mythological sea creature that symbolizes God's enemies.<br>
 <a name="fn43" href="gen.htm#fnB43"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:22) While the translation "blessed" has been retained here for the sake of simplicity, it would be most helpful to paraphrase it as "God endowed them with fruitfulness" or something similar, for here it refers to God's giving the animals the capacity to reproduce. The expression "blessed" needs clarification in its different contexts, for it is one of the unifying themes of the Book of Genesis. The divine blessing occurs after works of creation and is intended to continue that work--the word of blessing guarantees success. The word means "to enrich; to endow," and the most visible evidence of that enrichment is productivity or fruitfulness. See Claus Westermann, <i>Blessing in the Bible and the Life of the Church </i>(Philadelphia: Fortress, 1968).<br>
 <a name="fn44" href="gen.htm#fnB44"><sup>45</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:22)  The instruction God gives to creation is properly a fuller expression of the statement just made ("God blessed them"), that he enriched them with the ability to reproduce. It is not saying that these were rational creatures who heard and obeyed the word; rather, it stresses that fruitfulness in the animal world is a result of the divine decree and not of some pagan cultic ritual for fruitfulness. The repeated emphasis of "be fruitful--multiply--fill" adds to this abundance God has given to life. The meaning is underscored by the similar sounds: <i>barak </i>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ErB</FONT>) with <i>bara</i>'<i> (</i><FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">arB</FONT>),<i> </i>and<i> parah (</i><FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrP</FONT>)<i> </i>with<i> rabah (</i><FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbr</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn45" href="gen.htm#fnB45"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:24)  There are three groups of land animals here: the cattle or livestock (mostly domesticated), things that creep or move close to the ground (such as reptiles or rodents), and the wild animals (all animals of the field). The three terms are general classifications without specific details.<br>
 <a name="fn46" href="gen.htm#fnB46"><sup>47</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:26)  The plural form of the verb has been the subject of much discussion through the years, and not surprisingly several suggestions have been put forward. Many Christian theologians interpret it as an early hint of plurality within the Godhead, but this view imposes later trinitarian concepts on the ancient text. Some have suggested the plural verb indicates majesty, but the plural of majesty is not used with verbs. Westermann (<i>Genesis 1-11</i>, 145) argues for a plural of "deliberation" here, but his proposed examples of this use (2 Sam 24:14; Isa 6:8) do not actually support his theory. In 2 Sam 24:14 David uses the plural as representative of all Israel, and in Isa 6:8 the LORD speaks on behalf of his heavenly court. In its ancient Israelite context the plural is most naturally understood as referring to God and his heavenly court (see 1 Kgs 22:19-22; Job 1:6-12; 2:1-6; Isa 6:1-8). (The most well-known members of this court are God's messengers, or angels. In Gen 3:5 the serpent may refer to this group as "gods/divine beings." See the note on the word "evil" in 3:5.) If this is the case, God invites the heavenly court to participate in the creation of mankind (perhaps in the role of offering praise, see Job 38:7), but he himself is the one who does the actual creative work (v. 27). Of course, this view does assume that the members of the heavenly court possess the divine "image" in some way. Since the image is closely associated with rulership, perhaps they share the divine image in that they, together with God and under his royal authority, are the executive authority over the world.<br>
 <a name="fn47" href="gen.htm#fnB47"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:26)  The Hebrew word is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;da</FONT> (`<i>adam</i>), which can sometimes refer to man, as opposed to woman. The term refers here to humankind, comprised of male and female. The singular is clearly collective (see the plural verb, "[that] they may rule" in v. 26b) and the referent is defined specifically as "male and female" in v. 27. Usage elsewhere in Gen. 1-11 supports this as well. In 5:2 we read: "Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and called their name `humankind' [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;da</FONT>]." The noun also refers to humankind in 6:1, 5-7 and in 9:5-6.<br>
 <a name="fn48" href="gen.htm#fnB48"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:26)  The two prepositions translated "in" and "according to" have overlapping fields of meaning and in this context seem to be virtually equivalent. In 5:3 they are reversed with the two words. The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;l#X#</FONT> (<i>selem</i>, "image") is used frequently of statues, models, and images--replicas (see D. J. A. Clines, "The Etymology of Hebrew <i>selem</i>," <i>JNWSL</i> 3 [1974]: 19-25). The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tWmD+</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">D=mWt</FONT>, "likeness") is an abstract noun; its verbal root means "to be like; to resemble." In the Book of Genesis the two terms describe human beings who in some way reflect the form and the function of the creator. The form is more likely stressing the spiritual rather than the physical. The "image of God" would be the God-given mental and spiritual capacities that enable people to relate to God and to serve him by ruling over the created order as his earthly vice-regents.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:26)  <i>In our image, after our likeness</i>. Similar language is used in the instructions for building the tabernacle. Moses was told to make it "according to the pattern" he was shown on the mount (Exod 25:9, 10). Was he shown a form, a replica, of the spiritual sanctuary in the heavenly places? In any case, what was produced on earth functioned as the heavenly sanctuary does, but with limitations.<br>
 <a name="fn49" href="gen.htm#fnB49"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:26)  Following the cohortative ("let us make"), the prefixed verb form with <i>vav</i> conjunctive indicates purpose/result (see Gen 19:20; 34:23; 2 Sam 3:21). God's purpose in giving mankind his image is that they might rule the created order on behalf of the heavenly king and his royal court. So the divine image, however it is defined, gives humankind the capacity and/or authority to rule over creation.<br>

The article does not distinguish man from woman here ("the man" as opposed to "the woman"), but rather indicates previous reference (see v. 26, where the noun appears without the article). It has the same function as English "the aforementioned."<br>
 <a name="fn53" href="gen.htm#fnB53"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:27)  The third person suffix on the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta@</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a@t</FONT>) is singular here, but collective.<br>
 <a name="fn54" href="gen.htm#fnB54"><sup>55</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:27)  The distinction of "mankind" as "male" and "female" is another point of separation in God's creation. There is no possibility that the verse is teaching that humans were first androgynous (having both male and female physical characteristics) and afterwards were separated. The mention of male and female prepares for the blessing to follow.<br>
 <a name="fn55" href="gen.htm#fnB55"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:28) As in v. 22 the verb "bless" here means "to endow with the capacity to reproduce and be fruitful," as the following context indicates. As in v. 22, the statement directly precedes the command "be fruitful and multiply." The verb carries this same nuance in Gen 17:16 (where God's blessing of Sarai imparts to her the capacity to bear a child); Gen 48:16 (where God's blessing of Joseph's sons is closely associated with their having numerous descendents); and Deut 7:13 (where God's blessing is associated with fertility in general, including numerous descendents). See also Gen 49:25 (where Jacob uses the noun derivative in referring to "blessings of the breast and womb," an obvious reference to fertility) and Gen 27:27 (where the verb is used of a field to which God has given the capacity to produce vegetation).<br>

 <a name="fn57" href="gen.htm#fnB57"><sup>58</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:28) Elsewhere the Hebrew verb translated "subdue" means "to enslave" (2 Chr 28:10; Neh 5:5; Jer 34:11, 16), "to conquer," (Num 32:22, 29; Josh 18:1; 2 Sam 8:11; 1 Chr 22:18; Zech 9:13; and probably Mic 7:19), and "to assault sexually" (Esth 7:8). None of these nuances adequately meets the demands of this context, for humankind is not viewed as having an adversarial relationship with the world. The general meaning of the verb appears to be "to bring under one's control for one's advantage." In Gen 1:28 one might paraphrase it as follows: "harness its potential and use its resources for your benefit." In an ancient Israelite context this would suggest cultivating its fields, mining its mineral riches, using its trees for construction, and domesticating its animals.<br>
 <a name="fn58" href="gen.htm#fnB58"><sup>59</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:28)  The several imperatives addressed to both males and females together (plural imperative forms) actually form two commands: reproduce and rule. God's word is not merely a form of blessing, but is now addressed to them personally; this is a distinct emphasis with the creation of human beings. But with the blessing comes the ability to be fruitful and to rule. In procreation they will share in the divine work of creating human life and passing on the divine image (see 5:1-3); in ruling they will serve as God's vice-regents on earth. They together, the human race collectively, have the responsibility of seeing to the welfare of that which is put under them and the privilege of using it for their benefit.<br>

On the literal level the phrase means essentially that God made this day different. But within the context of the Law, it means that the day belonged to God; it was for rest from ordinary labor, worship, and spiritual service. The day belonged to God.<br>

 <a name="fn71" href="gen.htm#fnB71"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  The Hebrew phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">td)l=oT hL#a@</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a@L#h T{l=d{t</FONT>) is traditionally translated as "these are the generations of" because the noun was derived from the verb "beget." Its usage, however, shows that it introduces more than genealogies; it begins a narrative that traces what became of the entity or individual mentioned in the heading. In fact, a good paraphrase of this heading would be: "This is what became of the heavens and the earth," for what follows is not another account of creation but a tracing of events from creation through the fall and judgment (the section extends from 2:4 through 4:26). See M. H. Woudstra, "The <FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">Tol&yuml;dot</FONT> of the Book of Genesis and Their Redemptive-Historical Significance," <i>CTJ </i>5 (1970).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:4)  The expression <i>this is the account of</i> is an important title used throughout the Book of Genesis, serving as the organizing principle of the work. It is always a heading, introducing the subject matter that is to come. From the starting point of the title, the narrative traces the genealogy or the records or the particulars involved. Although some would make the heading in 2:4 a summary of creation (1:1--2:3), that goes against the usage in the book. As a heading it introduces the theme of the next section, the particulars about this creation that God made. Genesis 2 is not a simple parallel account of creation; rather, beginning with the account of the creation of man and women, the narrative tells what became of that creation. As a beginning, the construction of 2:4-7 forms a fine parallel to the construction of 1:1-3. The subject matter of each <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">T{l=d{t</FONT> ("this is the account of") section of the book traces a decline or a deterioration through to the next beginning point, and each is thereby a microcosm of the book which begins with divine blessing in the garden, and ends with a coffin in Egypt. So, what became of the creation? Gen 2:4--4:26 will explain that sin entered the world and all but destroyed God's perfect creation.<br>
 <a name="fn72" href="gen.htm#fnB72"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  See the note on the phrase "the heavens and the earth" in 1:1.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:4)  This is the only use of the Hebrew noun<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl"> T{l=d{t</FONT> in the book that is not followed by a personal name (e.g., "this is the account of Isaac"). The poetic parallelism reveals that even though the account may be about the creation, it is the creation the LORD God made.<br>
 <a name="fn73" href="gen.htm#fnB73"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:4)  Advocates of the so-called documentary hypothesis of pentateuchal authorship argue that the introduction of the name Yahweh (LORD) here indicates that a new source (designated J), a parallel account of creation, begins here. In this scheme Gen 1:1-2:3 is understood as the priestly source (designated P) of creation. Critics of this approach often respond that the names, rather than indicating separate sources, were chosen to reflect the subject matter (see U. Cassuto, <i>The Documentary Hypothesis</i>). Gen 1:1--2:3 is the grand prologue of the book, showing the sovereign God creating by decree. The narrative beginning in 2:4 is the account of what this God invested in his creation. Since it deals with the close, personal involvement of the covenant God, the narrative uses the covenantal name Yahweh (LORD) in combination with the name God. For a recent discussion of the documentary hypothesis from a theologically conservative perspective, see D. Garrett, <i>Rethinking Genesis</i>. For an attempt by source critics to demonstrate the legitimacy of the source critical method on the basis of ancient Near Eastern parallels, see J. H. Tigay, ed., <i>Empirical Models for Biblical Criticism</i>. For reaction to the source critical method by literary critics, see I. M. Kikawada and A.

The verb forms, although appearing to be imperfects, are technically preterites coming after the adverb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;r\F#</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">f#r#&lt;</FONT>). The word order (conjunction + subject + predicate) indicates a disjunctive clause, which provides background information for the following narrative (as in 1:2). Two negative clauses are given ("before any sprig...", and "before any cultivated grain" existed), followed by two causal clauses explaining them, and then a positive circumstantial clause is given--again dealing with water as in 1:2 (water would well up). <br>

It is a way of saying: "back before anything was growing."<br>
 <a name="fn77" href="gen.htm#fnB77"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:5)  The two causal clauses explain the first two disjunctive clauses: there was no uncultivated, general growth because there was no rain, and there were no grains because there was no man to cultivate the soil.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:5)  The last clause in v. 5, "and there was no man to cultivate the ground," anticipates the curse and the expulsion from the garden (Gen 3:23).<br>
 <a name="fn78" href="gen.htm#fnB78"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6)  The conjunction <i>vav</i> introduces a third disjunctive clause. The Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">da</FONT> (`<i>ed</i>) was traditionally translated "mist" because of its use in Job 36:27. However, an Akkadian cognate <i>edu </i>in Babylonian texts refers to subterranean springs or waterways. Such a spring would fit the description in this context, since this water "goes up" and waters the ground.<br>
 <a name="fn79" href="gen.htm#fnB79"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:6) <i>Heb</i> "was going up." The verb is an imperfect form, which in this narratival context carries a customary nuance, indicating continual action in past time.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (2:6)  Here is an indication of fertility.

 <a name="fn82" href="gen.htm#fnB82"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:7) Or "fashioned." The prefixed verb form with <i>vav</i> consecutive initiates narrative sequence. The Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rxy</FONT><i> </i>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">y&#180;x^r</FONT>) means "to form" or "to fashion," usually by plan or design (see the related noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rx#y}</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">y}x#r</FONT>] in Gen 6:5). It is the term for an artist's work (The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rx@oy</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">yox@r</FONT>] refers to a potter; see Jer 18:2-4.)<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:7)  Various traditions in the ancient Near East reflect this idea of creation. Egyptian drawings show a deity turning little people off of the potter's wheel with another deity giving them life. In the Bible humans are related to the soil and return to it (see 3:19; see also Job 4:19, 20:9; and Isa 29:16).<br>
 <a name="fn83" href="gen.htm#fnB83"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:7)  The line literally reads "And Yahweh God formed the man, soil, from the ground." "Soil" is an adverbial accusative, identifying the material from which the man was made.<br>

C. Mitchell, "The Old Testament Usage of <FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">N&yuml;shama</FONT>," <i>VT</i> 11 [1961]: 177-87). Its usage in the Bible conveys more than a breathing living organism (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hY&#180;j^ vp#n\</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">n\p#v j^Y*h</FONT>]). Whatever is given this breath of life becomes animated with the life from God, has spiritual understanding (Job 32:8), and has a functioning conscience (Prov 20:27).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:7)  Human life is described here as consisting of a body (made from soil from the ground) and breath (given by God). Both animals and humans are called <i>a living being</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">n\p#v j^Y*h</FONT>) but mankind became that in a different and more significant way.<br>

A harmonization with chap. 1 might lead to the conclusion that it was by decree, prior to the creation of human life.

 <a name="fn93" href="gen.htm#fnB93"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:9)  In light of Gen 3:22, the construction "tree of life" should be interpreted to mean a tree that produces life-giving fruit (objective genitive) rather than a living tree (attributive genitive). See E. D. James, <i>The Tree of Life: An Archaeological Study</i> (Leiden: Brill, 1966); and R. Marcus, "The Tree of Life in Proverbs," <i>JBL</i> 62 (1943): 117-20.<br>
 <a name="fn94" href="gen.htm#fnB94"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:9)  The expression "tree of the knowledge of good and evil" must be interpreted to mean that the tree would produce fruit which, when eaten, gives special knowledge of "good and evil." Scholars debate what this phrase means here. For a survey of opinions, see G. Wenham, <i>Genesis 1-15</i>, 62-64. One view is that "good" refers to that which enhances, promotes, and produces life, while "evil" refers to anything that hinders, interrupts or destroys life. So eating from this tree would change human nature--people would be able to alter life for better (in their thinking) or for worse. See D. J. A. Clines, "The Tree of Knowledge and the Law of Yahweh," <i>VT</i> 24 (1974): 8-14, and I. Engnell, "`Knowledge' and `Life' in the Creation Story," VTSup 3 (1955): 103-119. Another view understands the "knowledge of good and evil" as the capacity to discern between moral good and evil. The following context suggests the tree's fruit gives one wisdom (see the phrase "capable of making one wise" in 3:6, as well as the note there on the word "wise"), which certainly includes the capacity to discern between good and evil. Such wisdom is characteristic of divine beings, as the serpent's promise implies (3:5) and as 3:22 makes clear. (Note, however, that this capacity does not include the ability to <i>do</i> what is right!) God prohibits man from eating of the tree. The prohibition becomes a test to see if man will be satisfied with his role and place, or if he will try to ascend to the divine level. There will be a time for man to possess moral discernment/wisdom, as God reveals and imparts it to him, but it is not something to be grasped at in an effort to become "a god." In fact, the command to be obedient was the first lesson in moral discernment/wisdom. God was essentially saying: "Here is lesson one--respect my authority and commands. Disobey me and you will die." When man disobeys, he decides he does not want to acquire moral wisdom God's way, but instead tries to rise immediately to the divine level. Once man has acquired such divine wisdom by eating the tree's fruit (3:22), he must be banned from the garden so that he will not be able to achieve his goal of being godlike and thus live forever, a divine characteristic (3:24). Ironically, man now has the capacity to discern good from evil (3:22), but he is morally corrupted and rebellious and will not consistently choose what is right.<br>
 <a name="fn95" href="gen.htm#fnB95"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:10)  The disjunctive clause (note the construction conjunction + subject + predicate) introduces an entire paragraph about the richness of the region in the east.<br>
 <a name="fn96" href="gen.htm#fnB96"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:10)  The Hebrew active participle may be translated here as indicating past durative action, "was flowing," or as a present durative, "flows." Since this river was the source of the rivers mentioned in vv. 11-14, which appear to describe a situation contemporary with the narrator, it is preferable to translate the participle in v. 10 with the present tense. This suggests that Eden and its orchard still existed in the narrator's time. According to ancient Jewish tradition, Enoch was taken to the Garden of Eden, where his presence insulated the garden from the destructive waters of Noah's flood. See <i>Jub.</i> 4:23-24 (in <i>OTP</i> 2:62-63).<br>
 <a name="fn97" href="gen.htm#fnB97"><sup>35</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:10)  <i>Eden</i> is portrayed here as a source of life-giving rivers (that is, perennial streams). This is no surprise because its orchard is where the tree of life is located. Eden is a source of life, but tragically its orchard is no longer accessible to humankind. The river flowing out of Eden is a tantalizing reminder of this. God continues to provide life-giving water to sustain physical existence on the earth, but immortality has been lost.<br>

 <a name="fn108" href="gen.htm#fnB108"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:15)  Traditionally translated "the Garden of Eden," the context makes it clear that the garden (or orchard) was in Eden (making "Eden" a genitive of location).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (2:15)  Note that man's task is <i>to care for and maintain</i> the trees of the orchard. Not until after the fall, when he is condemned to cultivate the soil, does this task change.<br>
 <a name="fn110" href="gen.htm#fnB110"><sup>48</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:16)  This is the first time in the Bible that the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">x*w&#180;H</FONT><i> </i>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hw&#180;x*</FONT>, "to command") appears. Whatever the man had to do in the garden, the main focus of the narrative is on keeping God's commandments. God created humans with the capacity to obey him and then tested them with commands.<br>
 <a name="fn111" href="gen.htm#fnB111"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:16)  The imperfect verb form probably carries the nuance of permission ("you may eat") since the man is not being commanded to eat from every tree. The accompanying infinitive absolute adds emphasis: "you may freely eat," or, "you may eat to your heart's content."<br>
 <a name="fn112" href="gen.htm#fnB112"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:16)  The word "fruit" is not in the Hebrew text, but is implied as the direct object of the verb "eat." Presumably the only part of the tree the man would eat would be its fruit (cf. 3:2).<br>
 <a name="fn113" href="gen.htm#fnB113"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:17)  The disjunctive clause here indicates contrast: "but from the tree of the knowledge...."<br>
 <a name="fn114" href="gen.htm#fnB114"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:17)  The negated imperfect verb form indicates prohibition, "you must not eat."<br>
 <a name="fn115" href="gen.htm#fnB115"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:17)  Or "in the very day, as soon as." If one understands the expression to have this more precise meaning, then the following narrative presents a problem, for the man does not die physically as soon as he eats from the tree. In this case one may argue that spiritual death is in view, but it is also possible that God mercifully gave man a reprieve, allowing him to live longer than he deserved. See J. Sanders, <i>The God Who Risks: A Theology of Providence</i>, 48.<br>
 <a name="fn116" href="gen.htm#fnB116"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:17)  <i>Heb</i> "dying you will die." The imperfect verb form here has the nuance of the specific future because it is introduced with the temporal clause, "when you eat...you will die." That certainty is underscored with the infinitive absolute, "you will <i>surely</i> die."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:17)  The Hebrew text ("dying you will die") does not refer to two aspects of death ("dying spiritually, you will then die physically"). The construction simply emphasizes the certainty of death, however it is defined. Death is essentially separation. To die physically means separation from the land of the living, but not extinction. To die spiritually means to be separated from God. Both occur with sin, although the physical alienation is more gradual than instant, and the spiritual is immediate, although the effects of it continue the separation.<br>
 <a name="fn117" href="gen.htm#fnB117"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:18)  <i>Heb </i>"The being of man by himself is not good." The meaning of "good" must be defined contextually. Within the context of creation, in which God instructs mankind to be fruitful and multiply, the man alone cannot comply. Being alone prevents the man from fulfilling the design of creation and therefore is not good.<br>
 <a name="fn118" href="gen.htm#fnB118"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:18)  Traditionally "helper." The modern connotation of the Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rz\u@</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u@z#r</FONT>, "helper") can be negative. The word does not suggest a subordinate role. In the Bible God is frequently described as the "helper," the one who does for us what we cannot do for ourselves, the one who meets our needs. In this context the word seems to express the idea of an "indispensable companion." The woman would supply what the man was lacking in the design of creation and logically it would follow that the man would supply what she was lacking, although that is not stated here. See further M. L. Rosenzweig, "A Helper Equal to Him," <i>Judaica</i> 139 (1986): 277-80.<br>
 <a name="fn119" href="gen.htm#fnB119"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:18)  The Hebrew expression <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">oDg=g+n\K=</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">K=n\g=D{</FONT>) literally means "according to the opposite of him." Translations such as "suitable [for]" (NASB, NIV), "matching," "corresponding to" all capture the idea. (Translations that render the phrase simply "partner" [cf. NEB, NRSV], while not totally inaccurate, do not reflect the nuance of correspondence and/or suitability.) The man's form and nature are matched by the woman's as she reflects him and complements him. Together they correspond. In short, this prepositional phrase indicates that she has everything that God had invested in him.<br>
 <a name="fn120" href="gen.htm#fnB120"><sup>58</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:19) Or "fashioned." To harmonize the order of events with the chronology of chapter one, some translate the prefixed verb form with <i>vav</i> consecutive as a past perfect ("had formed," cf. NIV) here. (In chapter one the creation of the animals preceded the creation of man; here the animals are created after the man.) However, it is unlikely that the Hebrew construction can be translated in this way in the middle of this pericope, for the criteria for unmarked temporal overlay are not present here. See S. R. Driver, <i>A Treatise on the Use of the Tenses in Hebrew</i>, 84-88, and especially R. Buth, "Methodological Collision between Source Criticism and Discourse Analysis," 138-54, in R. D. Bergen, ed., <i>Biblical Hebrew and Discourse Linguistics</i>. For a contrary viewpoint see <i>IBHS</i> 552-53 and C. J. Collins, "The <i>Wayyiqtol</i> as `Pluperfect': When and Why," <i>TynB </i>46 (1995): 117-40.<br>
 <a name="fn121" href="gen.htm#fnB121"><sup>59</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:19)  The imperfect verb form is future from the perspective of the past time narrative.<br>
 <a name="fn122" href="gen.htm#fnB122"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:20)  Here for the first time the Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;d&#180;a*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a*d*&lt;</FONT>) appears without the article, suggesting that it might now be the name "Adam" rather than "[the] man." Translations of the Bible differ as to where they make the change from "man" to "Adam" (e.g., NASB and NIV translate "Adam" here, while NEB and NRSV continue to use "the man"; the KJV uses "Adam" twice in v. 19).<br>
 <a name="fn123" href="gen.htm#fnB123"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:20)  <i>Heb</i> "there was not found a companion who corresponded to him." The subject of the third masculine singular verb form is indefinite. Without a formally expressed subject the verb may be translated as passive: "one did not find = there was not found."<br>
 <a name="fn124" href="gen.htm#fnB124"><sup>62</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:21) <i>Heb</i> "And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man."<br>
 <a name="fn125" href="gen.htm#fnB125"><sup>63</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:21)  <i>Heb </i>"and he slept." In the sequence the verb may be subordinated to the following verb to indicate a temporal clause ("while...").<br>
 <a name="fn126" href="gen.htm#fnB126"><sup>64</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:21)  Traditionally translated "rib," the Hebrew word actually means "side." The Hebrew text reads, "and he took one from his sides," which could be rendered "part of his sides." That idea may fit better the explanation by the man that the woman is his flesh and bone.<br>
 <a name="fn127" href="gen.htm#fnB127"><sup>65</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:21) <i>Heb</i> "closed up the flesh under it."<br>
 <a name="fn128" href="gen.htm#fnB128"><sup>66</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:22)  The Hebrew verb is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hn&#180;B*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">B*n&#180;h</FONT>, "to make; to build; to construct"). The text states that the LORD God built the rib into a woman. Again, the passage gives no indication of precisely how this was done.<br>
 <a name="fn129" href="gen.htm#fnB129"><sup>67</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:23)  The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;u^P^h^</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">h^PP^u^&lt;</FONT>) means "the [this] time; this place," or "now; finally; at last." The expression conveys the futility of the man while naming the animals and finding no one who corresponded to him.<br>
 <a name="fn130" href="gen.htm#fnB130"><sup>68</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:23)  The Hebrew text is very precise, stating: "of this one it will be said, `woman'." The text is not necessarily saying that the man named his wife--that comes after the fall (Gen 3:20).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:23)  Some argue that naming implies the man's authority or ownership over the woman here. Naming can indicate ownership or authority if one is calling someone or something <i>by</i> one's name and/or calling a name <i>over</i> someone or something (see 2 Sam 12:28; 2 Chr 7:14; Isa 4:1; Jer 7:14; 15:16), especially if one is conquering and renaming a site. But the idiomatic construction used here (the Niphal of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">arq</FONT> with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l</FONT>) does not suggest such an idea. In each case where it is used, the one naming discerns something about the object being named and gives it an appropriate name (See 1 Sam 9:9; 2 Sam 18:18; Prov 16:21; Isa 1:26; 32:5; 35:8; 62:4, 12; Jer 19:6). Adam is not so much naming the woman as he is discerning her close relationship to him and referring to her accordingly. He may simply be anticipating that she will be given an appropriate name based on the discernible similarity (see v. 23).<br>
 <a name="fn131" href="gen.htm#fnB131"><sup>69</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:23)  Or "from" (but see v. 22).<br>
 <a name="fn132" href="gen.htm#fnB132"><sup>70</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:23)  This poetic section expresses the correspondence between the man and the woman. She is bone of his bones, flesh of his flesh. Note the wordplay (paronomasia) between "woman" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a!V*h</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hV*a!</FONT>]) and "man" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a!v</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vya!</FONT>]). On the surface it appears that the word for woman is the feminine form of the word for man. But the two words are not etymologically related. The sound and the sense give that impression, however, and make for a more effective wordplay.<br>
 <a name="fn133" href="gen.htm#fnB133"><sup>71</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:24)  This statement, introduced by the Hebrew phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/K@-lu^</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u^l-K@/</FONT>, "therefore" or "that is why"), is an editorial comment, not an extension of the quotation. The statement is describing what typically happens, not what will or should happen. It is saying, "This is why we do things the way we do." It links a contemporary (with the narrator) practice with the historical event being narrated. The historical event narrated in v. 23 provides the basis for the contemporary practice described in v. 24. That is why the imperfect verb forms are translated with the present tense rather than future. <br>
 <a name="fn134" href="gen.htm#fnB134"><sup>72</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:24)  The imperfect verb form has a habitual or characteristic nuance. For other examples of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/K@-lu^</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u^l-K@/</FONT>, "therefore"; "that is why") with the imperfect in a narrative framework, see Gen 10:9; 32:32 (the phrase "to this day" indicates characteristic behavior is in view); Num 21:14, 27; 1 Sam. 5:5 (note "to this day"); 19:24 (perhaps the imperfect is customary here, "were saying"); 2 Sam. 5:8. The verb translated "leave" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dz&#180;u*</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u*z&#180;d</FONT>) normally means "to abandon; to forsake; to leave behind; to discard," when used with human subject and object (see Josh 22:3; 1 Sam 30:13; Ps 27:10; Prov 2:17; Isa 54:6; 60:15; 62:4; Jer 49:11).  Within the context of the ancient Israelite extended family structure, this cannot refer to emotional or geographical separation. The narrator is using hyperbole to emphasize the change in perspective that typically overtakes a young man when his thoughts turn to love and marriage.<br>
 <a name="fn135" href="gen.htm#fnB135"><sup>73</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:24)  The perfect with <i>vav</i> consecutive carries the same habitual or characteristic nuance as the preceding imperfect. The verb is traditionally translated "cleaves [to]"; it has the basic idea of "stick with/to" (e.g., it is used of Ruth resolutely staying with her mother-in-law in Ruth 1:14). In this passage it describes the <i>inseparable</i> relationship between the man and the woman in marriage as God intended it.<br>
 <a name="fn136" href="gen.htm#fnB136"><sup>74</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:24) <i>Heb</i> "and they become one flesh." The perfect with <i>vav</i> consecutive carries the same habitual or characteristic nuance as the preceding verbs in the verse. The retention of the word "flesh" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rc*B*</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">B*c*r</FONT>) in the translation often leads to improper or incomplete interpretations. The Hebrew word refers to more than just a sexual union. When they unite in marriage, the man and woman bring into being a new family unit (<i>hayah + lamed</i> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l= </FONT>+ <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hyh</FONT>] preposition means "become"). The phrase "one flesh" occurs only here and must be interpreted in light of v. 23. There the man declares that the woman is bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. To be one's "bone and flesh" is to be related by blood to someone. For example, the phrase describes the relationship between Laban and Jacob (Gen 29:14); Abimelech and the Shechemites (Judg 9:2; his mother was a Shechemite); David and the Israelites (2 Sam 5:1); David and the elders of Judah (2 Sam 19:12,); and David and his nephew Amasa (2 Sam 19:13, see 2 Sam 17:2; 1 Chr 2:16-17). The expression "one flesh" seems to indicate that they become, as it were, "kin," at least legally (a new family unit is created) or metaphorically. In this first marriage in human history, the woman was literally formed from the man's bone and flesh. Even though later marriages do not involve such a divine surgical operation, the first marriage sets the pattern for how later marriages are understood and explains why marriage supersedes the parent-child relationship.<br>
 <a name="fn137" href="gen.htm#fnB137"><sup>75</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:25) <i>Heb</i> "And the two of them were naked, the man and his wife." <br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:25)  <i>Naked</i>. The motif of nakedness is introduced here and plays an important role in the next chapter. In the Bible nakedness conveys different things. In this context it signifies either innocence or integrity, depending on how those terms are defined. There is no fear of exploitation, no sense of vulnerability. But after the entrance of sin into the race, nakedness takes on a negative sense. It is then usually connected with the sense of vulnerability, shame, exploitation, and exposure (such as the idea of "uncovering nakedness" either in sexual exploitation or in captivity in war). <br>
 <a name="fn138" href="gen.htm#fnB138"><sup>76</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:25)  The imperfect verb form here has a customary nuance, indicating a continuing condition in past time. The meaning of the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">voB</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">B{v</FONT>) is "to be ashamed; to put to shame," but its meaning is stronger than "to be embarrassed." The word conveys the fear of exploitation or evil--enemies are put to shame through military victory. It indicates the feeling of shame that approximates a fear of evil.<br>
 <a name="fn139" href="gen.htm#fnB139"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:1)  The chapter begins with a disjunctive clause (conjunction + subject + predicate) that introduces a new character and a new scene in the story. <br>
 <a name="fn140" href="gen.htm#fnB140"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:1)  Many theologians identify or associate <i>the serpent</i> with Satan. In this view Satan comes in the disguise of a serpent or speaks through a serpent. This explains the serpent's capacity to speak. While later passages in the Bible may indicate there was a satanic presence behind the serpent (see, for example, Rev 12:9), the immediate context pictures the serpent as simply one of the animals of the field created by God (see vv. 1, 14). An ancient Jewish interpretation explains the reference to the serpent in a literal manner, attributing the capacity to speak to all the animals in the orchard. This text (<i>Jub.</i> 3:28) states, "On that day [the day the man and woman were expelled from the orchard] the mouth of all the beasts and cattle and birds and whatever walked or moved was stopped from speaking because all of them used to speak to one another with one speech and one language [presumed to be Hebrew! see 12:26]" (see <i>OTP</i> 2:60). Josephus (<i>Ant.</i> 1 &#167;41) attributes the serpent's actions to jealousy. He writes that "the serpent, living in the company of Adam and his wife, grew jealous of the blessings which he supposed were destined for them if they obeyed God's behests, and, believing that disobedience would bring trouble on them, he maliciously persuaded the woman to taste of the tree of wisdom."<br>
 <a name="fn141" href="gen.htm#fnB141"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:1)  The Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;Wru*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u*rW&lt;</FONT>) basically means "clever." This idea then polarizes into the nuances "cunning" (in a negative sense, see Job 5:12; 15:5), and "prudent" in a positive sense (Prov 12:16, 23; 13:16; 14:8, 15, 18; 22:3; 27:12). This same polarization of meaning can be detected in related words derived from the same root (see Exod 21:14; Josh 9:4; 1 Sam 23:22; Job 5:13; Ps 83:3). The negative nuance obviously applies in Gen 3, where the snake attempts to talk the woman into disobeying God by using half-truths and lies.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:1)  There is a wordplay in Hebrew between the words "naked" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u&amp;rWM!&lt;</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yM!Wru&amp;</FONT>]) in 2:25 and "shrewd" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u*rW&lt;</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;Wru*</FONT>]) in 3:1. The point seems to be that the integrity of the man and the woman is the focus of the serpent's craftiness. At the beginning they are naked and he is shrewd; afterward, they will be covered and he will be cursed.<br>
 <a name="fn142" href="gen.htm#fnB142"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:1)  <i>Heb</i> "animals of the field."<br>
 <a name="fn143" href="gen.htm#fnB143"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:1)  <i>Heb </i>"Indeed that God said." The beginning of the quotation is elliptical and therefore difficult to translate. One must supply a phrase like "is it true": "Indeed, [is it true] that God said."<br>
 <a name="fn144" href="gen.htm#fnB144"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:1)  <i>God</i>. The serpent does not use the expression "Yahweh God" [LORD God] because there is no covenant relationship involved between God and the serpent. He only speaks of "God." In the process the serpent draws the woman into his manner of speech so that she too only speaks of "God."<br>
 <a name="fn145" href="gen.htm#fnB145"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:1)  <i>Heb </i>"you must not eat from all the tree[s] of the orchard." After the negated prohibitive verb, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lkm</FONT> ("from all") has the meaning "from any." Note the construction in Lev 18:26, where the statement "you must not do from all these abominable things" means "you must not do <i>any</i> of these abominable things." See Lev 22:25 and Deut 28:14 as well.<br>
 <a name="fn146" href="gen.htm#fnB146"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:2)  There is a notable change between what the LORD God had said and what the woman says. God said "you may freely eat" (the imperfect with the infinitive absolute, see 2:16), but the woman omits the emphatic infinitive, saying simply "we may eat." Her words do not reflect the sense of eating to her heart's content.<br>
 <a name="fn147" href="gen.htm#fnB147"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:3)  <i>And you must not touch it</i>. The woman adds to God's prohibition, making it say more than God expressed. Gerhard von Rad observes that it is as though she wanted to set a law for herself by means of this exaggeration (G. von Rad, <i>Genesis</i>, 86).<br>
 <a name="fn148" href="gen.htm#fnB148"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:3)  The Hebrew construction is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/P#</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">P#/</FONT>) with the imperfect tense, which conveys a negative purpose: "lest you die" = "in order that you not die." By stating the warning in this way, the woman omits the emphatic infinitive used by God ("you shall surely die," see 2:17).<br>
 <a name="fn149" href="gen.htm#fnB149"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:4)  The response of the serpent includes the infinitive absolute with a blatant negation equal to saying: "Not--you will surely die" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/Wtm%T= tom aO)</FONT>). The construction makes this emphatic because normally the negative particle precedes the finite verb. The serpent is a liar, denying that there is a penalty for sin (see John 8:44).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:4)  <i>Surely you will not die</i>. Here the serpent is more aware of what the LORD God said than the woman was; he simply adds a blatant negation to what God said. In the account of Jesus' temptation Jesus is victorious because he knows the scripture better than Satan (Matt 4:1-11).<br>
 <a name="fn150" href="gen.htm#fnB150"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:5)  Or "you will have understanding." This obviously refers to the acquisition of the "knowledge of good and evil," as the next statement makes clear.<br>
 <a name="fn151" href="gen.htm#fnB151"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:5)  Or perhaps "like God, knowing." It is unclear how the plural participle translated "knowing"<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> </FONT>is functioning. On the one hand, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yu@d+y{</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">y{du@y</FONT>) could be taken as a substantival participle functioning as a predicative adjective in the sentence. In this case one might translate: "You will be, like God himself, knowers of good and evil." On the other hand, it could be taken as an attributive adjective modifying <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yh!Oa$</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a$Oh!&lt;</FONT>). In this case <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yh!Oa$</FONT> has to be taken as a numerical plural referring to "gods," "divine beings," for if the one true God were the intended referent, a singular form of the participle would almost certainly appear as a modifier. Following this line of interpretation, one could translate, "You will be like divine beings who know good and evil."  The following context may favor this translation, for in 3:22 God says to an unidentified group, "Look, the man has become like one of <i>us</i>, knowing good and evil." It is probable that God is addressing his heavenly court (see the note on the word "make" in 1:26), the members of which can be called "gods" or "divine beings" from the ancient Israelite perspective. (We know some of these beings as messengers or "angels.") An examination of parallel constructions shows that a predicative understanding ("you will be, like God himself, knowers of good and evil," cf. NIV, NRSV) is possible, but rare (see Gen 27:23, where "hairy" is predicative, complementing the verb "to be"). The statistical evidence strongly suggests that the participle is attributive, modifying "divine beings" (see Ps 31:12; Isa 1:30; 13:14; 16:2; 29:5; 58:11; Jer 14:9; 20:9; 23:9; 31:12; 48:41; 49:22; Hos 7:11; Amos 4:11). In all of these texts, where a comparative clause and accompanying adjective/participle follow a copulative ("to be") verb, the adjective/participle is attributive after the noun in the comparative clause.<br>
 <a name="fn152" href="gen.htm#fnB152"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:5)  <i>You will be like divine beings who know good and evil</i>. The serpent raises doubts about the integrity of God. He implies that the only reason for the prohibition was that God was protecting the divine domain. If the man and woman were to eat, they would enter into that domain. The temptation is to overstep divinely established boundaries. (See D. E. Gowan, <i>When Man Becomes God: Humanism and </i>Hybris<i> in the Old Testament</i> [Pittsburgh: Pickwick, 1975].)<br>

This term and the later term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dm*j=n\</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">n\j=m*d</FONT>, "desirable") are synonyms.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:6)  <i>Attractive </i>(<i>Heb</i> "desirable")<i>...desirable</i>. These are different words in Hebrew. The verbal roots for both of these forms appear in Deut 5:21 in the prohibition against coveting. Strong desires usually lead to taking.<br>

On the connection between moral wisdom and the "knowledge of good and evil," see the note on the word "evil" in 2:9.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:6)  <i>Desirable for making one wise</i>. The quest for wisdom can follow the wrong course, as indeed it does here. No one can become like God by disobeying God. It is that simple. The Book of Proverbs stresses that obtaining wisdom begins with the fear of God that is evidenced through obedience to his word. Here, in seeking wisdom, Eve disobeys God and ends up afraid of God.<br>
 <a name="fn157" href="gen.htm#fnB157"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:6)  The pronoun "it" is not in the Hebrew text, but is supplied (here and also after "ate" at the end of this verse) for stylistic reasons.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:6)  <i>She took...and ate it</i>. The critical word now discloses the disobedience: "[she] ate." Since the LORD God had said, "You shall not eat," the main point of the divine inquisition will be, "Did you eat," meaning, "did you disobey the command?" The woman ate, being deceived by the serpent (1 Tim 2:14), but then the man ate, apparently willingly when the woman gave him the fruit (see Rom 5:12, 17-19).<br>
 <a name="fn158" href="gen.htm#fnB158"><sup>20</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:6)  This pericope (3:1-7) is a fine example of Hebrew narrative structure. After an introductory disjunctive clause that introduces a new character and sets the stage (3:1), the narrative tension develops through dialogue, culminating in the action of the story. Once the dialogue is over, the action is told in a rapid sequence of verbs--she took, she ate, she gave, and he ate.<br>
 <a name="fn159" href="gen.htm#fnB159"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:8)  The Hitpael participle of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">El*h*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">h*l*E</FONT>, "to walk; to go") here has an iterative sense, "moving" or "going about." While a translation of "walking about" is possible, it assumes a theophany, the presence of the LORD God in a human form. This is more than the text asserts.<br>
 <a name="fn160" href="gen.htm#fnB160"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:8)  The expression is traditionally rendered "cool of the day," because the Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">j^Wr</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">rW^j</FONT>) can mean "wind." U. Cassuto concludes after lengthy discussion that the expression refers to afternoon when it became hot and the sun was beginning to decline (<i>Commentary on the Book of Genesis, From Adam to Noah</i>, 152-154). J. Niehaus offers a different interpretation of the phrase, relating <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;oy</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">y{&lt;</FONT>, usually understood as "day") to an Akkadian cognate <i>umu</i>, "storm," and translates the phrase "in the wind of the storm" (<i>God at Sinai</i>, 155-57). If Niehaus is correct, then God is not pictured as taking an afternoon stroll through the orchard, but as coming in a powerful windstorm to confront the man and woman with their rebellion. In this case <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwhy lwq</FONT>, "sound of the LORD," may refer to God's thunderous roar, which typically accompanies his appearance in the storm to do battle or render judgment (e.g., see Ps 29).<br>
 <a name="fn161" href="gen.htm#fnB161"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:8)  The verb used here is the Hitpael, giving the reflexive idea ("they hid themselves"). In v. 10, when Adam answers the LORD, the Niphal form is used with the same sense: "I hid."<br>
 <a name="fn162" href="gen.htm#fnB162"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:9)  The Hebrew verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ar&#180;q*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">q*r*a</FONT>, "to call") followed by the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">-la#</FONT> or <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l=</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a#l-</FONT> or <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">l=</FONT>, "to; unto") often carries the connotation of "summon."<br>
 <a name="fn163" href="gen.htm#fnB163"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:9)  <i>Where are you?</i> The question is probably rhetorical (a figure of speech called erotesis) rather than literal, because it was spoken to the man, who answers it with an explanation of <i>why</i> he was hiding rather than a location. The question has more the force of "Why are you hiding?"<br>
 <a name="fn164" href="gen.htm#fnB164"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:10)  <i>Heb </i>"and he said."<br>
 <a name="fn165" href="gen.htm#fnB165"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:10)  <i>Heb </i>"your sound." If one sees a storm theophany here (see the note on the word "time" in v. 8), then one could translate, "your powerful voice." <br>
 <a name="fn166" href="gen.htm#fnB166"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:11)  <i>Heb </i>"and he said." The referent (the LORD God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn167" href="gen.htm#fnB167"><sup>29</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:11)  <i>Who told you that you were naked?</i> This is another rhetorical question, asking more than what it appears to ask. The second question in the verse reveals the LORD God's real concern.<br>
 <a name="fn168" href="gen.htm#fnB168"><sup>30</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:11)  The Hebrew word order ("Did you from the tree--which I commanded you not to eat from it--eat?") is arranged to emphasize that the man's and the woman's eating of the fruit was an act of disobedience. The relative clause inserted immediately after the reference to the tree brings out this point very well.<br>
 <a name="fn169" href="gen.htm#fnB169"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:12)  The Hebrew construction in this sentence uses an independent nominative absolute (formerly known as a <i>casus pendens</i>). "The woman" is the independent nominative absolute; it is picked up by the formal subject, the pronoun "she" written with the verb ("she gave"). The point of the construction is to throw the emphasis on "the woman." But what makes this so striking is that a relative clause has been inserted to explain what is meant by the reference to the woman: "whom you gave me." Ultimately, the man is blaming God for giving him the woman who (from the man's viewpoint) caused him to sin.<br>
 <a name="fn170" href="gen.htm#fnB170"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:12)  The words "some fruit" here and the pronoun "it" at the end of the sentence are not in the Hebrew text, but are supplied for stylistic reasons.<br>
 <a name="fn171" href="gen.htm#fnB171"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:13)  The use of the demonstrative pronoun is enclitic, serving as an undeclined particle for emphasis. It gives the sense of "What in the world have you done?" (see Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;118).<br>
 <a name="fn172" href="gen.htm#fnB172"><sup>34</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:13)  The Hebrew word order puts the subject ("the serpent") before the verb here, giving prominence to it.<br>
 <a name="fn173" href="gen.htm#fnB173"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:13)  This verb (the Hiphil of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">avn</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">n&#180;v*a</FONT>]) is used elsewhere of a king or god misleading his people into false confidence (2 Kgs 18:29 = 2 Chr 32:15 = Isa 36:14; 2 Kgs. 19:10 = Isa 37:10), of an ally deceiving a partner (Obad 7), of God deceiving his sinful people as a form of judgment (Jer 4:10), of false prophets instilling their audience with false hope (Jer 29:8), and of pride and false confidence producing self-deception (Jer 37:9; 49:16; Obad 3). <br>
 <a name="fn174" href="gen.htm#fnB174"><sup>36</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:14)  Note that God asks no question of the serpent, does not call for confession, as he did to the man and the woman; there is only the announcement of the curse. The order in this section is chiastic: the man is questioned, the woman is questioned, the serpent is cursed, sentence is passed on the woman, sentence is passed on the man.<br>
 <a name="fn175" href="gen.htm#fnB175"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:14)  The Hebrew word translated "cursed," a passive participle from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rr&#180;a*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a*r*r</FONT>), either means "punished" or "banished," depending on how one interprets the following preposition. If the preposition is taken as comparative, then the idea is "cursed [i.e., punished] are you above [i.e., more than] all the wild beasts." In this case the comparative preposition reflects the earlier comparison: the serpent was more shrewd than all others, and so more cursed than all others. If the preposition is taken as separative (see the note on the word "ground" in 4:11), then the idea is "cursed and banished from all the wild beasts." In this case the serpent is condemned to isolation from all the other animals.<br>
 <a name="fn176" href="gen.htm#fnB176"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:14) <i>Heb</i> "go"; "walk," but in English "crawl" or "slither" better describes a serpent's movement.<br>
 <a name="fn177" href="gen.htm#fnB177"><sup>39</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:14)  <i>Dust you will eat</i>. Being restricted to crawling on the ground would necessarily involve "eating dust," although that is not the diet of the serpent. The idea of being brought low, of "eating dust" as it were, is a symbol of humiliation.<br>
 <a name="fn178" href="gen.htm#fnB178"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:15)  The Hebrew word translated "hostility" is derived from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bya</FONT> ("to be hostile; to be an adversary [or, enemy]"). The curse announces that there will be continuing hostility between the serpent and the woman. The serpent will now live in a "battle zone," as it were.<br>
 <a name="fn179" href="gen.htm#fnB179"><sup>41</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:15)  The Hebrew word translated "offspring" is a collective singular. The text anticipates the ongoing struggle between human beings (the woman's offspring) and deadly poisonous snakes (the serpent's offspring). An ancient Jewish interpretation of the passage states: "He made the serpent, cause of the deceit, press the earth with belly and flank, having bitterly driven him out. He aroused a dire enmity between them. The one guards his head to save it, the other his heel, for death is at hand in the proximity of men and malignant poisonous snakes." See <i>Sib. Or.</i> 1:59-64 (in <i>OTP</i> 1:336). For a similar interpretation see Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 1 &#167;&#167;50-51.<br>
 <a name="fn180" href="gen.htm#fnB180"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:15)  <i>Heb</i> "he will attack [or, "bruise"] you [on] the head." The singular pronoun and verb agree grammatically with the collective singular noun "offspring." To clarify the collective sense of the pronoun, the translation uses the English plural pronoun "they." For other examples of singular verb and pronominal forms being used with the collective singular "offspring," see Gen 16:10; 22:17; 24:60. The word "head" is an adverbial accusative, locating the blow. A crushing blow to the head would be potentially fatal.<br>
 <a name="fn181" href="gen.htm#fnB181"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:15)  The disjunctive clause (conjunction + subject + verb) is understood as contrastive. Another option is to translate, "as they attack your head, you will attack their heel." Both clauses place the subject before the verb, a construction that is sometimes used to indicate synchronic action (see Judg 15:14).<br>
 <a name="fn182" href="gen.htm#fnB182"><sup>44</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:15)  <i>You will attack their heel</i>. Though the conflict will actually involve the serpent's offspring (snakes) and the woman's offspring (human beings), v. 15b for rhetorical effect depicts the conflict as being between the serpent and the woman's offspring, as if the serpent will outlive the woman. The statement is personalized for the sake of the addressee (the serpent) and reflects the ancient Semitic concept of corporate solidarity, which emphasizes the close relationship between a progenitor and his offspring. Note Gen 28:14, where the LORD says to Jacob, "Your offspring will be like the dust of the earth, and you [second masculine singular!] will spread out in all directions." Jacob will "spread out" in all directions through his offspring, but the text states the matter as if this will happen to him personally.<br>
 <a name="fn183" href="gen.htm#fnB183"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:15)  <i>Heb</i> "you will attack him [on] the heel." The verb (translated "attack") is repeated here, a fact that is obscured by some translations (e.g., NIV "crush...strike"). The singular pronoun agrees grammatically with the collective singular noun "offspring." To clarify the collective sense of the pronoun, the translation uses the English plural "their." For other examples of singular verb and pronominal forms being used with the collective singular "offspring," see Gen 16:10; 22:17; 24:60. The word "heel" is an adverbial accusative, locating the blow. A bite on the heel from a poisonous serpent is potentially fatal.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (31:49)  The etiological nature of v. 15 is apparent, though its relevance for modern western man is perhaps lost because we rarely come face to face with poisonous snakes. Ancient Israelites, who often encountered snakes in their daily activities (see, for example, Eccl 10:8; Amos 5:19), would find the statement quite meaningful as an explanation for the hostility between snakes and humans. (In the broader ancient Near Eastern context, compare the Mesopotamian serpent omens. See W. H. F. Saggs, <i>The Greatness that was Babylon</i>, 309.) This ongoing struggle, when interpreted in light of v. 15, is a tangible reminder of the conflict introduced into the world by the first humans' rebellion against God. Many Christian theologians (going back to Irenaeus) understand v. 15 as the so-called <i>protevangelium</i>, supposedly prophesying Christ's victory over Satan (see W. Witfall, "Genesis 3:15--a Protevangelium?" <i>CBQ</i> 36 <sup>104</sup>: 361-65; and R. A. Martin, "The Earliest Messianic Interpretation of Genesis 3:15," <i>JBL</i> 84 [1965]: 425-27). In this allegorical approach, the woman's offspring is initially Cain, then the whole human race, and ultimately Jesus Christ, the<i> offspring</i> (<i>Heb</i> "seed") of the woman (see Gal 4:4). The <i>offspring</i> of the serpent includes the evil powers and demons of the spirit world, as well as those humans who are in the kingdom of darkness (see John 8:44). According to this view, the passage gives the first hint of the gospel. Satan delivers a crippling blow to the Seed of the woman (Jesus), who in turn delivers a fatal blow to the Serpent (first defeating him through the death and resurrection [1 Cor 15:55-57] and then destroying him in the judgment [Rev 12:7-9; 20:7-10]). However, the grammatical structure of Gen 3:15b does not suggest this view. The repetition of the verb "attack," as well as the word order, suggests mutual hostility is being depicted, not the defeat of the serpent. If the serpent's defeat were being portrayed, it is odd that the alleged description of his death comes first in the sentence. If he has already been crushed by the woman's "Seed," how can he bruise his heel? To sustain the allegorical view, v. 15b must be translated in one of the following ways: "he will crush your head, even though you attack his heel" (in which case the second clause is concessive) or "he will crush your head as you attack his heel" (the clauses, both of which place the subject before the verb, may indicate synchronic action).<br>
 <a name="fn184" href="gen.htm#fnB184"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:16)  The imperfect verb form is emphasized and intensified by the infinitive absolute from the same verb.<br>
 <a name="fn185" href="gen.htm#fnB185"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:16)  <i>Heb</i> "your pain and your conception," suggesting to some interpreters that having a lot of children was a result of the judgment (probably to make up for the loss through death). But the next clause shows that the pain is associated with conception and childbirth. The two words form a hendiadys (where two words are joined to express one idea, like "good and angry" in English), the second explaining the first. "Conception," if the correct meaning of the noun, must be figurative here since there is no pain in conception; it is a synecdoche, representing the entire process of childbirth and child rearing from the very start. However, recent etymological research suggests the noun is derived from a root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rrh</FONT>, not <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrh</FONT>, and means "trembling, pain" (see D. Tsumura, "A Note on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/orh</FONT> (Gen 3,16)," <i>Bib</i> 75 [1994]: 398-400). In this case "pain and trembling" refers to the physical effects of childbirth. The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/obX=u!</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u!X=b{/</FONT>, "pain"), an abstract noun related to the verb (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bXu</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u*X*b</FONT>), includes more than physical pain. It is emotional distress as well as physical pain. The same word is used in v. 17 for the man's painful toil in the field.<br>
 <a name="fn186" href="gen.htm#fnB186"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:16)  <i>Heb</i> "and toward your husband [will be] your desire." The nominal sentence does not have a verb; a future verb must be supplied, because the focus of the oracle is on the future struggle. The precise meaning of the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hq*WvT=</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">T=vWq*h</FONT>, "desire") is debated. Many interpreters conclude that it refers to sexual desire here, because the subject of the passage is the relationship between a wife and her husband, and because the word is used in a romantic sense in Song 8:6. However, this interpretation makes little sense in Gen 3:16. First, it does not fit well with the assertion "he will dominate you." Second, it implies that sexual desire was not part of the original creation, even though the man and the woman were told to multiply. And third, it ignores the usage of the word in Gen 4:7 where it refers to sin's desire to control and dominate Cain. (Even in Song of Songs it carries the basic idea of "control," for it describes the young man's desire to "have his way sexually" with the young woman.) In Gen 3:16 the LORD announces a struggle, a conflict between the man and the woman. She will desire to control him, but he will dominate her instead. This interpretation also fits the tone of the passage, which is a judgment oracle. See further Susan T. Foh, "What is the Woman's Desire?" <i>WTJ</i> 37 (1975): 376-83.<br>
 <a name="fn187" href="gen.htm#fnB187"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:16)  The Hebrew verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lvm</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">m*v*l</FONT>) means "to rule over," but in a way that emphasizes powerful control, domination, or mastery. This also is part of the baser human nature. The translation assumes the imperfect verb form has an objective/indicative sense here. Another option is to understand it as having a modal, desiderative nuance, "but he will want to dominate you." In this case, the LORD simply announces the struggle without indicating who will emerge victorious.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:16)  This passage is a judgment oracle. It announces that conflict between man and woman will become the norm in human society. It does not depict the NT ideal, where the husband sacrificially loves his wife, as Christ loved the church, and where the wife recognizes the husband's loving leadership in the family and voluntarily submits to it. Sin produces a conflict or power struggle between the man and the woman, but in Christ man and woman call a truce and live harmoniously (Eph 5:18-32).<br>
 <a name="fn188" href="gen.htm#fnB188"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:17)  Since there is no article on the word, the personal name is used, rather than the generic "the man" (cf. NRSV).<br>
 <a name="fn189" href="gen.htm#fnB189"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:17)  The idiom "listen to the voice of" often means "obey." The man "obeyed" his wife and in the process disobeyed God.<br>
 <a name="fn190" href="gen.htm#fnB190"><sup>52</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:17)  For the ground to be <i>cursed</i> means that it will no longer yield its bounty as the blessing from God had promised. The whole creation, Paul writes in Rom 8:22, is still groaning under this curse, waiting for the day of redemption.<br>
 <a name="fn191" href="gen.htm#fnB191"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:17)  The Hebrew phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;r\Wbu&amp;B^</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">B^u&amp;bWr#;</FONT>) is more literally translated "on your account" or "because of you." The idiomatic "thanks to you" in the translation tries to capture the point of this expression.<br>
 <a name="fn192" href="gen.htm#fnB192"><sup>54</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:17)  <i>In painful toil you will eat</i>. The theme of eating is prominent throughout Gen 3. The prohibition was against eating from the tree of knowledge. The sin was in eating. The interrogation concerned the eating from the tree of knowledge. The serpent is condemned to eat the dust of the ground. The curse focuses on eating in a "measure for measure" justice. Because the man and the woman sinned by eating the forbidden fruit, God will forbid the ground to cooperate, and so it will be through painful toil that they will eat.<br>
 <a name="fn193" href="gen.htm#fnB193"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:18)  The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bc#u@</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u@c#b</FONT>), when referring to human food, excludes grass (eaten by cattle) and woody plants like vines.<br>
 <a name="fn194" href="gen.htm#fnB194"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:19)  The expression "the sweat of your brow" is a metonymy, the sweat being the result of painful toil in the fields.<br>
 <a name="fn195" href="gen.htm#fnB195"><sup>57</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:19)  <i>Until you return to the ground</i>. The theme of mankind's mortality is critical here in view of the temptation to be like God. Man will labor painfully to provide food, obviously not enjoying the bounty that creation promised. In place of the abundance of the orchard's fruit trees, thorns and thistles will grow. Man will have to work the soil so that it will produce the grain to make bread. This will continue until he returns to the soil from which he was taken (recalling the creation in 2:7 with the wordplay on Adam and ground). In spite of the dreams of immortality and divinity, man is but dust (2:7), and will return to dust. So much for his pride.<br>
 <a name="fn196" href="gen.htm#fnB196"><sup>58</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:19)  In general, the themes of the curse oracles are important in the NT teaching that Jesus became the cursed one hanging on the tree. In his suffering and death, all the motifs are drawn together: the tree, the sweat, the thorns, and the dust of death (see Ps 22:15). Jesus experienced it all, to have victory over it through the resurrection.<br>

The text gives no indication of how this was done, or how they came by the skins. Earlier in the narrative (v. 7) the attempt of the man and the woman to cover their nakedness with leaves expressed their sense of alienation from each other and from God. By giving them more substantial coverings, God indicates this alienation is greater than they realize. This divine action is also ominous; God is preparing them for the more hostile environment in which they will soon be living (v. 23). At the same time, there is a positive side to the story in that God makes provision for the man's and woman's condition.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (31:37)  <i>Sentries</i> (<i>Heb</i> "cherubim"). The cherubim in the Bible seem to be a class of angels that are composite in appearance. Their main task seems to be guarding. Here they guard the way to the tree of life. The curtain in the tabernacle was to be embroidered with cherubim as well, symbolically guarding the way to God. (See in addition A. S.

 <a name="fn210" href="gen.htm#fnB210"><sup>72</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:24)  <i>Heb</i> "the flame of the sword that turns round and round." The noun "flame" is qualified by the genitive of specification, "the sword," which in turn is modified by the attributive participle "whirling." The Hitpael of the verb "turn" has an iterative function here, indicating repeated action. The form is used in Job 37:12 of swirling clouds and in Judg 7:13 of a tumbling roll of bread. Verse 24 depicts the sword as moving from side to side to prevent anyone from passing or as whirling around, ready to cut to shreds anyone who tries to pass.<br>

 <a name="fn214" href="gen.htm#fnB214"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:1)  Here is another sound play (paronomasia) on a name. The sound of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yt!yn]q*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">q*n!t!</FONT>, "I have created") reflects the sound of the name Cain in Hebrew (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/y]q^</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">q^y!/</FONT>]) and gives meaning to it. The saying uses the Qal perfect of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnq</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">q*n&#180;h</FONT>). There are two homonymic verbs with this spelling: one meaning "obtain, acquire" and the other meaning "create" (see Gen 14:19, 22; Deut 32:6; Ps 139:13; Prov 8:22). The latter fits this context very well. Eve has created a man!<br>
 <a name="fn215" href="gen.htm#fnB215"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:1)  <i>Heb </i>"with the LORD." The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">-ta#</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a#t-</FONT>) is not the accusative/object sign, but the preposition "with" as the ancient versions attest. Some take the preposition in the sense of "with the help of" (see BDB 86; cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV), while others prefer "along with" in the sense of "like, equally with, in common with" (see Lev 26:39; Isa 45:9; Jer 23:28). Either works well in this context; the latter is reflected in the present translation. Some understand <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta#</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a#t</FONT>) as the accusative/object sign and translate, "I have acquired a man--the LORD." They suggest that the woman thought (mistakenly!) that she had given birth to the incarnate LORD, the Messiah who would bruise the Serpent's head. This fanciful suggestion is based on a questionable allegorical interpretation of Gen 3:15 (see the note there on the word "heel").<br>
 <b>sn </b> (4:1) Since Exod 6:3 seems to indicate that the name Yahweh (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwhy</FONT>, translated LORD) was first revealed to Moses (see also Exod 3:14), it is odd to see it used in quotations in Genesis by people who lived long before Moses. This problem has been resolved in various ways: (1) Source critics propose that Exod 6:3 is part of the "P" (or priestly) tradition, which is at odds with the "J" (or Yahwistic) tradition. (2) Many propose that "name" in Exod 6:3 does not refer to the divine name per se, but to the character suggested by the name. God appeared to the patriarchs primarily in the role of El Shaddai, the giver of fertility, not as Yahweh, the one who fulfills his promises. In this case the patriarchs knew the name Yahweh, but had not experienced the full significance of the name. In this regard it is possible that Exod 6:3b should not be translated as a statement of denial, but as an affirmation followed by a rhetorical question implying that the patriarchs did indeed know God by the name of Yahweh, just as they knew him as El Shaddai. D. Garrett, following the lead of F. Andersen, sees Exod 6:2-3 as displaying a paneled A/B parallelism and translates them as follows (D. Garrett, <i>Rethinking Genesis</i> [Baker, 1991], 21):  (A) "I am Yahweh." (B) "And I made myself known to Abraham...as El Shaddai." (A') "And my name is Yahweh"; (B') "Did I not make myself known to them?" However, even if one translates the text this way, the LORD's words do not necessarily mean that he made the name Yahweh known to the fathers. God is simply affirming that he now wants to be called Yahweh (see Exod 3:14-16) and that he revealed himself in prior times as El Shaddai. If we stress the parallelism with B, the implied answer to the concluding question might be: "Yes, you did make yourself known to them--as El Shaddai!" The main point of the verse would be that El Shaddai, the God of the fathers, and the God who has just revealed himself to Moses as Yahweh are one and the same. (3) Wenham suggests that pre-Mosaic references to Yahweh are the product of the author/editor of Genesis, who wanted to be sure that Yahweh was identified with the God of the fathers. In this regard, note how Yahweh is joined with another divine name or title in Gen 9:26-27; 14:22; 15:2, 8; 24:3, 7, 12, 27, 42, 48; 27:20; 32:9. The angel uses the name Yahweh when instructing Hagar concerning her child's name, but the actual name (Ishma-el, "El hears") suggests that El, not Yahweh, originally appeared in the angel's statement (16:11). In her response to the angel Hagar calls God El, not Yahweh (16:13). In 22:14 Abraham names the place of sacrifice "Yahweh Will Provide" (cf. v. 16), but in v. 8 he declares, "God will provide." God uses the name Yahweh when speaking to Jacob at Bethel (28:13) and Jacob also uses the name when he awakens from the dream (28:16). Nevertheless he names the place Beth-el ("house of El"). In 31:49 Laban prays, "May Yahweh keep watch," but in v. 50 he declares, "God is a witness between you and me." Yahweh's use of the name in 15:7 and 18:14 may reflect theological idiom, while the use in 18:19 is within a soliloquy. (Other uses of Yahweh in quotations occur in 16:2, 5; 24:31, 35, 40, 42, 44, 48, 50, 51, 56; 26:22, 28-29; 27:7, 27; 29:32-35; 30:24, 30; 49:18. In these cases there is no contextual indication that a different name was originally used.) For a fuller discussion of this proposal, see G. Wenham, "The Religion of the Patriarchs," in <i>Essays on the Patriarchal Narratives</i> (ed. A. Millard and D. Wiseman; Eisenbrauns, 1983): 189-93. For a modern analogy to the technique being proposed, imagine a biography of Kareem Abdul Jabbar (= Lew Alcindor) which calls him Kareem when referring to the period of his life prior to his conversion to the Muslim faith and even has his parents and friends calling him "Kareem" during his childhood years.<br>

It is the main word used in Lev 2 for the dedication offering. This type of offering could be comprised of vegetables. The content of the offering (vegetables, as opposed to animals) was not the critical issue, but rather the attitude of the offerer.<br>
 <a name="fn221" href="gen.htm#fnB221"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:4)  <i>Heb </i>"But Abel brought, also he...." The disjunctive clause (conjunction + subject + verb) stresses the contrast between Cain's offering and Abel's. <br>
 <a name="fn222" href="gen.htm#fnB222"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:4)  Two prepositional phrases are used to qualify the kind of sacrifice that Abel brought: "from the firstborn" and "from the fattest of them." These also could be interpreted as a hendiadys: "from the fattest of the firstborn of the flock." Another option is to understand the second prepositional phrase as referring to the fat portions of the sacrificial sheep. In this case one may translate, "some of the firstborn of his flock, even some of their fat portions" (cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (4:4)  Here are two types of worshipers--one (Cain) merely discharges a duty at the proper time, while the other (Abel) goes out of his way to please God with the first and the best.<br>

The text does not indicate how this was communicated, but it indicates that Cain and Abel knew immediately. Either there was some manifestation of divine pleasure given to Abel and withheld from Cain (fire consuming the sacrifice?), or there was an inner awareness of divine response.<br>
 <a name="fn224" href="gen.htm#fnB224"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:5)  The Letter to the Hebrews explains the difference between the brothers as one of faith--Abel <i>by faith</i> offered a better sacrifice.

 <a name="fn225" href="gen.htm#fnB225"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:5)  <i>Heb</i> "and it was hot to Cain." This Hebrew idiom means that Cain "burned" with anger.<br>
 <a name="fn226" href="gen.htm#fnB226"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn </b> (4:5) <i>Heb</i> "And his face fell." The idiom means that the inner anger is reflected in Cain's facial expression. The fallen or downcast face expresses anger, dejection, or depression. Conversely, in Num 6 the high priestly blessing speaks of the LORD lifting up his face and giving peace.<br>
 <a name="fn227" href="gen.htm#fnB227"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:7)  The introduction of the conditional clause with an interrogative particle prods the answer from Cain, as if he should have known this. It is not a condemnation, but an encouragement to do what is right.<br>
 <a name="fn228" href="gen.htm#fnB228"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:7)  The Hebrew text is difficult, because only one word occurs, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta@c=</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">c=a@t</FONT>), which appears to be the infinitive construct from the verb "to lift up" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">can</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">n&#180;a*c</FONT>). The sentence reads: "If you do well, uplifting." On the surface it seems to be the opposite of the fallen face. Everything will be changed if he does well. God will show him favor, he will not be angry, and his face will reflect that. But more may be intended since the second half of the verse forms the contrast: "If you do not do well, sin is crouching...." Not doing well leads to sinful attack; doing well leads to victory and God's blessing.<br>
 <a name="fn229" href="gen.htm#fnB229"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:7)  The Hebrew term translated "crouching" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jb@r)</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">r)b@J</FONT>) is an active participle. Sin is portrayed with animal imagery here as a beast crouching and ready to pounce (a figure of speech known as zoomorphism). An Akkadian cognate refers to a type of demon; in this case perhaps one could translate, "Sin is the demon at the door" (see E.A. Speiser, <i>Genesis</i>, 29, 32-33).<br>
 <a name="fn230" href="gen.htm#fnB230"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:7)  <i>Heb</i> "and toward you [is] its desire, but you must rule over it." As in Gen 3:16, the Hebrew noun "desire" refers to an urge to control or dominate. Here the desire is that which sin has for Cain, a desire to control for the sake of evil; but Cain must have mastery over it. The imperfect is understood as having an obligatory sense. Another option is to understand it as expressing potential ("you can have [or, "are capable of having"] mastery over it."). It will be a struggle, but sin can be defeated by righteousness. In addition to this connection to Gen 3, other linguistic and thematic links between chaps. 3 and 4 are discussed by A. J. Hauser, "Linguistic and Thematic Links Between Genesis 4:1-6 and Genesis 2-3," <i>JETS</i> 23 (1980): 297-306.<br>
 <a name="fn231" href="gen.htm#fnB231"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tc</b> (4:8)  The MT has simply "and Cain said to Abel his brother," omitting Cain's words to Abel. It is possible that the elliptical text is original. Perhaps the author uses the technique of aposiopesis<i>,</i> "a sudden silence" to create tension. In the midst of the story the narrator suddenly rushes ahead to what happened in the field. It is more likely that the ancient versions (SP, LXX, Vg, and Syriac), which include Cain's words, "Let's go out to the field," preserve the original reading here. After writing <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wyja</FONT>, "his brother," a scribe's eye may have jumped to the end of the form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hdch</FONT>, "the field," and accidentally omitted the quotation. (This would be an error of virtual homoioteleuton. In older phases of the Hebrew script the sequence <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wy </FONT>on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wyja</FONT>, "his brother," is graphically similar to the final <i>he</i> on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hdch</FONT>, "the field.")<br>

 <b>sn</b> (4:9)  <i>Am I my brother's guardian?</i> Cain lies and then responds with a defiant rhetorical question of his own in which he repudiates any responsibility for his brother. But his question is ironic, for he <i>is</i> responsible for his brother's fate, especially if he wanted to kill him! See P. A. Riemann, "Am I My Brother's Keeper?" <i>Int</i> 24 (1970): 482-91.<br>

 <a name="fn238" href="gen.htm#fnB238"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:11)  <i>Heb</i> "cursed are you from the ground." As in Gen 3:14, the word "cursed," a passive participle from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rr&#180;a*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a*r*r</FONT>), either means "punished" or "banished," depending on how one interprets the following preposition. If the preposition is taken as indicating source, then the idea is "cursed (i.e., punished) are you from [i.e., "through the agency of"] the ground" (see v. 12a). If the preposition is taken as separative, then the idea is "cursed and banished from the ground." In this case the ground rejects Cain's efforts in such a way that he is banished from the ground and forced to become a fugitive out in the earth (see vv. 12b, 14).<br>

But by metonymy it can refer to the "guilt" of sin, or to "punishment" for sin. The third meaning applies here.

Lamech misses the point of God's merciful treatment of Cain. God was not establishing a principle of justice when he warned he would avenge Cain's murder.

Instead of simply saying that Enoch lived, the text observes that he "walked with God." The rare expression "walked with" (the Hitpael<i> </i>form of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Elh</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">h*l*E</FONT>, "to walk"] collocated with the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta#</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a#t</FONT>, "with"]) is used in 1 Sam 25:15 to describe how David's men maintained a cordial and cooperative relationship with Nabal's men as they worked and lived side by side in the fields. In Gen 5:22 the phrase suggests that Enoch and God "got along." This may imply that Enoch lived in close fellowship with God, leading a life of devotion and piety. An early Jewish tradition, preserved in <i>1 Enoch</i> 1:9 (see <i>OTP</i> 1:13) and alluded to in Jude 14, says that Enoch preached about the coming judgment. See F. S.

The letters <i>nun</i> and <i>heth</i> pick up the sounds in the name "Noah," forming a paronomasia on the name. They are not from the same verbal root, and so the connection is only by sound. Lamech's sentiment reflects the oppression of living under the curse on the ground, but also expresses the hope for relief in some way through the birth of Noah. His words proved to be ironic but prophetic. The relief would come with a new beginning after the flood. See E. G. Kraeling, "The Interpretations of the Name Noah in Genesis 5:29," <i>JBL</i> 48 (1929): 138-43.<br>

 <a name="fn293" href="gen.htm#fnB293"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (6:2)  The Hebrew phrase translated "sons of God" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">b=n}-h*a$Oh!&lt;</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yh!Oa$h*-yn}b=</FONT>) occurs only here (Gen 6:2, 4) and in Job 1:6; 2:1; 38:7. In the Book of Job the phrase clearly refers to angelic beings. In Gen 6 the "sons of God" are distinct from "mankind," suggesting they were not human. This is consistent with the use of the phrase in Job. Since the passage speaks of these beings cohabiting with women, they must have taken physical form or possessed the bodies of men. An early Jewish tradition, preserved in <i>1 Enoch</i> 6-7, elaborates on this angelic revolt and even names the ringleaders (see <i>OTP</i> 1:15-16). (2) Not all scholars accept the angelic interpretation of the "sons of God," however. Some argue that the "sons of God" were members of Seth's line, traced back to God through Adam in Gen 5, while the "daughters of mankind" were descendents of Cain. But, as noted above, the text distinguishes the "sons of God" from mankind (which would include the Sethites as well as the Cainites) and suggests that the "daughters of mankind" are human women in general, not just Cainites. (3) Others identify the "sons of God" as powerful tyrants, perhaps demon-possessed, who viewed themselves as divine and, following the example of Lamech (see Gen 4:19), practiced polygamy. But usage of the phrase "sons of God" in Job militates against this view. For literature on the subject see G. Wenham, <i>Genesis 1-15</i>, 135.<br>
 <a name="fn294" href="gen.htm#fnB294"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:3)  The verb form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ody&#180;</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">y&#180;d{/</FONT>) only occurs here.

The Old Greek has "remain with," a rendering which may find support from an Arabic cognate (see C. Westermann, <i>Genesis</i>, 375). If one interprets the verb in this way, then it is possible to understand <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">j^Wr</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">rW^j</FONT>)as a reference to the divine life-giving spirit or breath, rather than the LORD's personal Spirit. Speiser argues that the term is cognate with an Akkadian word meaning "protect" or "shield." In this case, the LORD's Spirit will not always protect mankind, for the race will suddenly be destroyed (E. A. Speiser, "YDWN, Gen. 6:3," <i>JBL</i> 75 [1956]: 126-29). <br>

Some interpret this to mean that the age expectancy of people from this point on would be one hundred twenty, but neither the subsequent narrative nor reality favors this. It is more likely that this refers to the time remaining between this announcement of judgment and the coming of the flood.<br>
 <a name="fn301" href="gen.htm#fnB301"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:4)  The Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yl!yp!n+</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">n+p!l!&lt;</FONT>) is simply transliterated here, because the meaning of the term is uncertain. According to the text, the Nephilim became mighty warriors and gained great fame in the antediluvian world. The text may imply they were the offspring of the sexual union of the "sons of God" and the "daughters of mankind" (v. 2), but it stops short of saying this in a direct manner. The Nephilim are mentioned in the OT only here and in Num 13:33, where it is stated that they were giants. The narrator observes that the Anakites of Canaan were descendents of the Nephilim. Certainly these later Anakite Nephilim could not be descendents of the antediluvian Nephilim (see also the following note on the word "this").<br>
 <a name="fn302" href="gen.htm#fnB302"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:4)  This observation is parenthetical, explaining that there were Nephilim even after the flood. If all mankind, with the exception of Noah and his family, died in the flood, it is difficult to understand how the postdiluvian Nephilim could be related to the antediluvian Nephilim or how the Anakites of Canaan could be their descendents (see Num 13:33). It is likely that the term Nephilim refers generally to "giants" (see <i>HALOT</i> 709) without implying any ethnic connection between the antediluvian and postdiluvian varieties.<br>

The word means "warriors; mighty men; heroes." The appositional statement further explains that they were "men of renown." The text refers to superhuman beings who held the world in their power and who lived on in ancient lore outside the Bible. See E. A. Speiser, <i>Genesis</i>, 45-46; C.

In the Niphal stem the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;jn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">n&#180;j*&lt;</FONT>) can carry one of four semantic meanings, depending on the context:<sup> </sup>(1) "to experience emotional pain or weakness," "to feel regret," often concerning a past action (see Exod 13:17; Judg 21:6, 15; 1 Sam 15:11, 35; Job 42:6; Jer 31:19). In several of these texts <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk</FONT> ("because") introduces the cause of the emotional sorrow. (2) Another meaning is "to be comforted" or "to comfort oneself" (sometimes by taking vengeance). See Gen 24:67; 38:12; 2 Sam 13:39; Ps 77:3; Isa 1:24; Jer 31:15; Ezek 14:22; 31:16; 32:31. (This second category represents a polarization of category one.) (3) The meaning "to relent from" or "to repudiate" a course of action which is already underway is also possible (see Judg 2:18; 2 Sam 24:16 = 1 Chr 21:15; Pss 90:13; 106:45; Jer 8:6; 20:16; 42:10). (4) Finally, "to retract" (a statement) or "to relent or change one's mind concerning," "to deviate from" (a stated course of action) is possible (see Exod 32:12, 14; 1 Sam 15:29; Ps 110:4; Isa 57:6; Jer 4:28; 15:6; 18:8, 10; 26:3, 13, 19; Ezek 24:14; Joel 2:13-14; Am 7:3, 6; Jon 3:9-10; 4:2; Zech 8:14). See R. B. Chisholm, "Does God `Change His Mind'?" <i>BSac</i> 152 (1995): 388. The first category applies here because the context speaks of God's grief and emotional pain (see the following statement in v. 6) as a result of a past action (his making mankind). For a thorough study of the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;jn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">n&#180;j*&lt;</FONT>), see H. Van Dyke Parunak, "A Semantic Survey of <i>NHM</i>," <i>Bib</i> 56 (1975): 512-32.<br>
 <a name="fn314" href="gen.htm#fnB314"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:6)  <i>Heb </i>"and he was grieved to his heart." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bxu</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u*x*b</FONT>) can carry one of three semantic senses, depending on the context: (1) "to be injured" (Ps 56:5; Eccl 10:9; 1 Chr 4:10); (2) "to experience emotional pain"; "to be depressed emotionally"; "to be worried" (2 Sam 19:2; Isa 54:6; Neh 8:10-11); (3) "to be embarrassed"; "to be insulted"; "to be offended" (to the point of anger at another or oneself), Gen 34:7; 45:5; 1 Sam 20:3, 34; 1 Kgs 1:6; Isa 63:10; Ps 78:40. This third category develops from the second by metonymy. In certain contexts emotional pain leads to embarrassment and/or anger. In this last use the subject sometimes directs his anger against the source of grief (see especially Gen 34:7). The third category fits best in Gen 6:6 because mankind's sin does not merely wound God emotionally. On the contrary, it prompts him to strike out in judgment against the source of his distress (see v. 7). The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bX@u^t=Y]w~</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">w~Y!t=u^X@b</FONT>), a Hitpael from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bxu</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u*x*b</FONT>), alludes to the judgment oracles in Gen 3:16-19. Because Adam and Eve sinned, their life would be filled with pain; but sin in the human race also brought pain to God. The wording of v. 6 is ironic when compared to Gen 5:29.

Here, where it is qualified by "his" (i.e., Noah's), it refers to Noah's contemporaries, comprised of the preceding generation (his father's generation), those of Noah's generation, and the next generation (those the same age as his children).

The sense "morally corrupt" fits well in Gen 6:11 because of the parallelism (note "the earth was filled with violence"). In this case "earth" would stand by metonymy for its sinful inhabitants.  However, the translation "ruined" works just as well, if not better. In this case mankind's sin is viewed has having an adverse effect upon the earth.

Since moral corruption is in view here, most modern western interpreters understand the referent to be mankind. However, the phrase "all flesh" is used consistently of mankind and the animals in Gen 6-9 (6:17, 19; 7:15-16, 21; 8:17; 9:11, 15-17), suggesting that the author intends to picture all living creatures, mankind and animals, as guilty of moral failure. This would explain why the animals, not just mankind, are victims of the ensuing divine judgment. The OT sometimes views animals as morally culpable (Gen 9:5; Exod 21:28-29; Jonah 3:7-8). The OT also teaches that a person's sin can contaminate others (people and animals) in the sinful person's sphere (see the story of Achan, especially Josh 7:10). So the animals could be viewed here as morally contaminated because of their association with sinful mankind.<br>
 <a name="fn331" href="gen.htm#fnB331"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:12)  <i>Heb</i> "had corrupted its way." The third masculine singular pronominal suffix on "way" refers to the collective "all flesh." The construction "corrupt one's way" occurs only here (though Ezek 16:47 uses the Hiphil in an intransitive sense with the prep <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">b</FONT> [<i>bet</i>, "in"] followed by "ways"). The Hiphil of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tjv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">v*j*t</FONT>) means "to ruin; to destroy; to corrupt," often, as here, in a moral/ethical sense. The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Er\D\</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">D#r#E</FONT>, "way") here refers to behavior or moral character, a sense that it frequently carries (see BDB 203 [6.a]).<br>

The phrase "end of all flesh" occurs only here. The term "end" refers here to the end of "life," as v. 3 and the following context (which describes how God destroys all flesh) make clear. The statement "the end has come" occurs in Ezek 7:2, 6, where it is used of divine judgment. The phrase "come before" occurs in Exod 28:30, 35; 34:34; Lev 15:14; Num 27:17; 1 Sam 18:13, 16; 2 Sam 19:8; 20:8; 1 Kgs 1:23, 28, 32; Ezek 46:9; Pss 79:11 (groans come before God); 88:3 (a prayer comes before God); 100:2; 119:170 (prayer comes before God); Lam 1:22 (evil doing comes before God); Esth 1:19; 8:1; 9:25; 1 Chr 16:29. The expression often means "have an audience with" or "appear before." But when used metaphorically, it can mean "get the attention of" or "prompt a response." This is probably the sense in Gen 6:13. The necessity of ending the life of all flesh on earth is an issue that has gotten the attention of God. The term "end" may even be a metonymy for that which has prompted it--violence (see the following clause). <br>

Note the wordplay involving this verb in vv. 11-13: The earth is "ruined" because all flesh has acted in a morally "corrupt" manner. Consequently, God will "destroy" all flesh (the referent of the suffix "them") along with the ruined earth. They had ruined themselves and the earth with violence, and now God would ruin them with judgment. For other cases where "earth" occurs as the object of the Hiphil of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tjv</FONT>, see 1 Sam 6:5; 1 Chr 20:1; Jer 36:29; 51:25.<br>

 <a name="fn381" href="gen.htm#fnB381"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:18)  <i>Heb</i> and the waters were great and multiplied exceedingly." The first verb in the sequence is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WrB=g+Y]w~</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">w~Y!gB=rW</FONT>, from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rbG</FONT>), meaning "to become great [or, "mighty"]."

 <a name="fn382" href="gen.htm#fnB382"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn </b> (7:18) <i>Heb</i> "went."<br>
 <a name="fn383" href="gen.htm#fnB383"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn </b> (7:19) <i>Heb</i> "and the waters were great exceedingly, exceedingly." The repetition emphasizes the depth of the waters.<br>

 <a name="fn385" href="gen.htm#fnB385"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:20)  <i>Heb</i> "rose fifteen cubits." Since a cubit is considered by most authorities to be about eighteen inches, this would make the depth 22.5 feet. This figure might give the modern reader a false impression of exactness, however, so in the translation the phrase "fifteen cubits" has been rendered "more than twenty feet."<br>
 <a name="fn386" href="gen.htm#fnB386"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:20)  <i>Heb</i> "the waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward and they covered the mountains."

 <a name="fn393" href="gen.htm#fnB393"><sup>38</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:24)  The Hebrew verb translated "prevailed over" suggests that the waters were stronger than the earth. The earth and everything in it were no match for the return of the chaotic deep.<br>

 <a name="fn397" href="gen.htm#fnB397"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:3)  The construction combines a Qal<i> </i>preterite from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">vWb</FONT>) with its infinitive absolute to indicate continuous action.

 <a name="fn398" href="gen.htm#fnB398"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:3) <i>Heb</i> "the waters." The pronoun ("they") has been employed in the translation for stylistic reasons.<br>

 <a name="fn400" href="gen.htm#fnB400"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:4)  <i>Heb</i> "on the mountains of Ararat." Obviously a boat (even one as large as the ark) cannot rest on multiple mountains. Perhaps (1) the preposition should be translated "among," or (2) the plural "mountains" should be understood in the sense of "mountain range" (see E. A. Speiser, <i>Genesis</i>, 53). A more probable option (3) is that the plural indicates an indefinite singular, translated "one of the mountains" (see GKC &#167;124.<i>o</i>).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (8:4)  <i>Ararat</i> is the Hebrew name for Urartu, the name of a mountainous region located north of Mesopotamia in modern day eastern Turkey. See E. M.

 <a name="fn404" href="gen.htm#fnB404"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:6)  <i>Heb</i> "opened the window in the ark which he had made." The perfect tense ("had made") refers to action preceding the opening of the window, and is therefore rendered as a past perfect. Since in English "had made" could refer to either the ark or the window, the order of the phrases was reversed in the translation to clarify that the window is the referent.<br>
 <a name="fn405" href="gen.htm#fnB405"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:7) <i>Heb</i> "and it went out, going out and returning." The Hebrew verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">axy</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">y&#180;x*a</FONT>), translated here "flying," is modified by two infinitives absolute indicating that the raven went back and forth.<br>

Maurice includes a chapter on the sacrifice of Noah in his <i>The Doctrine of Sacrifice Deduced from the Scriptures</i> (London: Macmillan, 1893). The whole burnt offering, according to Leviticus 1, represented the worshiper's complete surrender and dedication to the LORD. After the flood Noah could see that God was not only a God of wrath, but a God of redemption and restoration. The one who escaped the catastrophe could best express his gratitude and submission through sacrificial worship, acknowledging God as the sovereign of the universe.<br>

The object forms a cognate accusative with the verb. The language is anthropomorphic. The offering had a sweet aroma that pleased or soothed. The expression in Lev 1 signifies that God accepts the offering with pleasure, and in accepting the offering he accepts the worshiper.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (9:4)  <i>You must not eat meat with its life...in it</i>. Because of the carnage produced by the flood, people might conclude that life is cheap and therefore treat it lightly. But God will not permit them to kill or even to eat anything with the lifeblood still in it, serving as a reminder of the sanctity of life.<br>
 <a name="fn442" href="gen.htm#fnB442"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:5)  Again the text uses apposition to clarify what kind of blood is being discussed: "your blood, [that is] for your life." See C. L. Dewar, "The Biblical Use of the Term `Blood'," <i>JTS</i> 4 (1953): 204-208.<br>
 <a name="fn443" href="gen.htm#fnB443"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:5)  The word "punishment" is not in the Hebrew text, but is supplied in the translation for clarification. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vr&#180;D&#180;</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">D*r*v</FONT>) means "to require; to seek; to ask for; to exact." Here it means that God will exact punishment for the taking of a life. See Ralph Mawdsley, "Capital Punishment in Gen. 9:6," <i>Central Bible Quarterly</i> 18 (1975): 20-25.<br>

 <a name="fn447" href="gen.htm#fnB447"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:5) <i>Heb</i> "from the hand of a man, his brother." The point is that God will require the blood of someone who kills, since the person killed is a relative ("brother") of the killer. The language reflects Noah's situation (after the flood everyone would be part of Noah's extended family), but also supports the concept of the brotherhood of mankind. According to the Genesis account the entire human race descended from Noah.<br>

However, the expression "see nakedness" usually refers to observation of another's nakedness, not a sexual act (see Gen 42:9, 12 [where "nakedness" is used metaphorically to convey the idea of "weakness" or "vulnerability"], Deut 23:14 [where "nakedness" refers to excrement], Isa 47:3, Ezek 16:37, Lam 1:8). The following verse (v. 23) clearly indicates that visual observation, not a homosexual act, is in view here. In Lev 20:17 the expression "see nakedness" does appear to be a euphemism for sexual intercourse, but the context there, unlike that of Gen 9:22, clearly indicates that in that passage sexual contact is in view. The expression "see nakedness" does not in itself suggest a sexual connotation. Some relate Gen 9:22 to Lev 18:6-11, 15-19, where the expression "uncover [the Piel form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlG</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">G*l*h</FONT>)] [another's] nakedness" refers euphemistically to sexual intercourse. However, Gen 9:22 does not say Ham "uncovered" the nakedness of his father. According to the text, Noah uncovered himself; Ham merely <i>saw</i> his father naked. The point of the text is that Ham had no respect for his father. Rather than covering his father up, he told his brothers. Noah then gave an oracle that Ham's descendants, who would be characterized by the same moral abandonment, would be cursed. Leviticus 18 describes that greater evil of the Canaanites (see vv. 24-28).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (9:22)  <i>Saw the nakedness</i>. It is hard for modern people to appreciate why seeing another's nakedness was such an abomination, because nakedness is so prevalent today. In the ancient world, especially in a patriarchal society, seeing another's nakedness was a major offense. (See the account in Herodotus 1.8-13, where a general saw the nakedness of his master's wife, and one of the two had to be put to death.) Besides, Ham was not a little boy wandering into his father's bedroom; he was over a hundred years old by this time. For fuller discussion see A. P. Ross, "The Curse of Canaan," <i>BSac</i> 137 (1980): 223-40.<br>

 <a name="fn489" href="gen.htm#fnB489"><sup>57</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:25)  <i>Cursed be Canaan</i>. The curse is pronounced on Canaan, not Ham. Noah sees a problem in Ham's character, and on the basis of that he delivers a prophecy about the future descendants who will live in slavery to such things and then be controlled by others. (For more on the idea of slavery in general, see E. M. Yamauchi, "Slaves of God," <i>BETS</i> 9 [1966]: 6-9). In a similar way Jacob pronounced oracles about his sons based on their revealed character (see Gen 49).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (9:27)  There is a wordplay (paronomasia) on the name <i>Japheth</i>. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">y^p=T=</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">T=p=y~</FONT>), "may he enlarge," sounds like the name <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">y#p#t</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tp#y\</FONT>), "Japheth." The name itself suggested the idea. The blessing for Japheth extends beyond the son to the descendants. Their numbers and their territories will be enlarged, so much so that they will share in Shem's territories. Again, in this oracle, Noah is looking beyond his immediate family to future generations.

It may very well be that the "sons of" list was an old, "bare bones" list that was retained in the family records, while the "begot" sections were editorial inserts by the writer of Genesis, reflecting his special interests.

 <a name="fn623" href="gen.htm#fnB623"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (12:1)  The LORD called Abram while he was in Ur (see Gen 15:7; Acts 7:2); but the sequence here makes it look like it was after the family left to migrate to Canaan (11:31-32). Genesis records the call of Abram at this place in the narrative because it is the formal beginning of the account of Abram. The record of Terah was brought to its end before this beginning.<br>
 <a name="fn624" href="gen.htm#fnB624"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:1)  The call of Abram begins with an imperative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;l=-El#</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">l#E-l=;</FONT>, "go out") followed by three cohortatives (v. 2a) indicating purpose or consequence ("that I may" or "then I will"). If Abram leaves, then God will do these three things. The second imperative (v. 2b, literally "and be a blessing") is subordinated to the preceding cohortatives and indicates God's ultimate purpose in calling and blessing Abram. On the syntactical structure of vv. 1-2 see R. B. Chisholm, "Evidence from Genesis," in <i>A Case for Premillennialism</i>, 37. For a similar sequence of volitive forms see Gen 45:18.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (12:1)  It would be hard to underestimate the value of this call and this divine plan for the theology of the Bible. Here begins God's plan to bring redemption to the world. The promises to Abram will be turned into a covenant in Gen 15 and 22 (here it is a call with conditional promises) and will then lead through the Bible to the work of the Messiah.<br>
 <a name="fn625" href="gen.htm#fnB625"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:1)  The initial command is the direct imperative (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">-El#</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">l#E-</FONT>) from the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Elh</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">h*l*E</FONT>).<i> </i>It is followed by the <i>lamed</i> preposition with a pronominal suffix (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;l=</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">l=;</FONT>)<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> </FONT>emphasizing the subject of the imperative: "<i>you</i> leave."<br>
 <a name="fn626" href="gen.htm#fnB626"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (12:1)  <i>To the land that I will show you</i>. The call of Abram illustrates the leading of the LORD. The command is to leave. The LORD's word is very specific about what Abram is to leave (the three prepositional phrases narrow to his father's household), but is not specific at all about where he is to go. God required faith, a point that Heb 11:8 notes.<br>
 <a name="fn627" href="gen.htm#fnB627"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:2)  The three first person verbs in v. 2a should be classified as cohortatives. The first two have pronominal suffixes, so the form itself does not indicate a cohortative. The third verb form is clearly cohortative.<br>
 <a name="fn628" href="gen.htm#fnB628"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (12:2)  <i>I will bless you</i>. The blessing of creation is now carried forward to the patriarch. In the garden God blessed Adam and Eve; in that blessing he gave them (1) a fruitful place, (2) endowed them with fertility to multiply, and (3) made them rulers over creation. That was all ruined at the fall. Now God begins to build his covenant people; in Gen 12-22 he promises to give Abram (1) a land flowing with milk and honey, (2) a great nation without number, and (3) kingship.<br>
 <a name="fn629" href="gen.htm#fnB629"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:2)  Or "I will make you famous."<br>
 <a name="fn630" href="gen.htm#fnB630"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:2)  <i>Heb</i> "and be a blessing." The verb form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hy}h=</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">h=y@h</FONT>) is the Qal imperative of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hyh</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">h*y&#180;h</FONT>). The <i>vav</i> with the imperative after the cohortatives indicates purpose or consequence. What does it mean for Abram to "be a blessing"? Will he be a channel or source of blessing for others, or a prime example of divine blessing? A similar statement occurs in Zech 8:13, where God assures his people, "You will be a blessing," in contrast to the past when they "were a curse." Certainly "curse" here does not refer to Israel being a source of a curse, but rather to the fact that they became a curse-word or byword among the nations, who regarded them as the epitome of an accursed people (see 2 Kgs 22:19; Jer 42:18; 44:8, 12, 22). Therefore the statement "be a blessing" seems to refer to Israel being transformed into a prime example of a blessed people, whose name will be used in blessing formulae, rather than in curses. If the statement "be a blessing" is understood in the same way in Gen 12:2, then it means that God would so bless Abram that other nations would hear of his fame and hold him up as a paradigm of divine blessing in their blessing formulae.<br>
 <a name="fn631" href="gen.htm#fnB631"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:3)  The Piel cohortative has as its object a Piel participle, masculine plural. Since the LORD binds himself to Abram by covenant, those who enrich Abram in any way share in the blessings.<br>
 <a name="fn632" href="gen.htm#fnB632"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:3)  In this part of God's statement there are two significant changes that often go unnoticed. First, the parallel and contrasting participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;l=L#q^m=</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">m=q^L#l=;</FONT>) is now singular and not plural. All the versions and a few Masoretic MSS read the plural. But if it had been plural, there would be no reason to change it to the singular and alter the parallelism. On the other hand, if it was indeed singular, it is easy to see why the versions would change it to match the first participle. The MT preserves the original reading: "the one who treats you lightly." The point would be a contrast with the lavish way that God desires to bless many. The second change is in the vocabulary. The English usually says, "I will curse those who curse you." But there are two different words for curse here. The first is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">llq</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">q*l*l</FONT>), which means "to be light" in the Qal<i>,</i> and in the Piel "to treat lightly; to treat with contempt; to curse." The second verb is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rra</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a*r*r</FONT>), which means "to banish; to remove from the blessing." The point is simple: whoever treats Abram and the covenant with contempt, as worthless, God will banish from the blessing. It is important also to note that the verb is not a cohortative, but a simple imperfect. Since God is binding himself to Abram, this would then be an obligatory imperfect: "but the one who treats you with contempt <i>I must curse</i>."<br>

(The Niphal<i> </i>of "bless" is only used in formulations of the Abrahamic covenant. See Gen 12:2; 18:18; 28:14.) Traditionally the verb is taken as passive here, as if Abram were going to be a channel or source of blessing. But in later formulations of the Abrahamic covenant (see Gen 22:18; 26:4) the Hitpael<i> </i>replaces this Niphal form, suggesting a translation "will bless [i.e., "pronounce blessings on"] themselves [or, "one another"]." The Hitpael of "bless" is used with a reflexive/reciprocal sense in Deut 29:18; Ps 72:17; Isa 65:16; Jer 4:2. Gen 12:2 predicts that Abram will be held up as a paradigm of divine blessing and that people will use his name in their blessing formulae. For examples of blessing formulae utilizing an individual as an example of blessing see Gen 48:20 and Ruth 4:11.<br>

Abram left Haran at the age of seventy-five after his father died. Abram was born when Terah was one hundred and thirty. Abram was not the firstborn--he is placed first in the list of three because of his importance. The same is true of the list in Gen 10:1 (Shem, Ham and Japheth). Ham was the youngest son (9:24). Japheth was the older brother of Shem (10:21), so the birth order of Noah's sons was Japheth, Shem, and Ham.<br>

He is aware of the danger to the family. His method of dealing with it is deception with a half truth, for Sarai really was his sister--but the Egyptians would not know that. Abram presumably thought that there would be negotiations for a marriage by anyone interested (as Laban does later for his sister Rebekah), giving him time to react. But the plan backfires because Pharaoh does not take the time to negotiate. There is a good deal of literature on the wife-sister issue. See (among others) E. A.

Just as the tree in the garden of Eden had awakened Eve's desire, so the fertile valley attracted Lot.

The description of the sinfulness of the Sodomites is very emphatic. First, two nouns are used to form a hendiadys: "wicked and sinners" means "wicked sinners," the first word becoming adjectival. The text is saying these were no ordinary sinners; they were wicked sinners, the type that cause pain for others. Then to this phrase is added "against the LORD," stressing their violation of the laws of heaven and their culpability.

 <b>sn </b> (13:14) <i>Look</i>. Earlier Lot "looked up" (v. 10), but here Abram is told by God to do so. The repetition of the expression (<i>Heb</i> "lift up the eyes") here underscores how the LORD will have the last word and actually do for Abram what Abram did for Lot--give him the land. It seems to be one of the ways that God rewards faith.<br>

 <a name="fn708" href="gen.htm#fnB708"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:17)  The Hitpael form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">EL@h^t=h!</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">h!t=h^L@E</FONT>) means "to walk about"; it also can carry the ideas of moving about, traversing, going back and forth, or living in an area.

Kings ruled over city states, or sometimes a number of city states (i.e., nations). Due to their treaties, when one went to war, those confederate with him joined him in battle. It appears here that it is Kedorlaomer's war, because the western city states have rebelled against him (meaning they did not send products as tribute to keep him from invading them).<br>

 <a name="fn717" href="gen.htm#fnB717"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:3)  The Hebrew verb used here means "to join together; to unite; to be allied." It stresses close associations, especially of friendships, marriages, or treaties.<br>

Eastern powers came and forced the western kingdoms into submission. Each year, then, they would send tribute east--to keep them away. Here, in the thirteenth year, they refused to send the tribute (just as later Hezekiah rebelled against Assyria). And so in the fourteenth year the eastern powers came to put them down again. This account from Abram's life taught future generations that God can give victory over such threats--that people did not have to live in servitude to tyrants from the east.<br>
 <a name="fn722" href="gen.htm#fnB722"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:5)  The Hebrew verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">n&#180;k*h</FONT>) means "to attack; to strike; to smite."

That is not impossible, given that the narrator likely utilized traditions and genealogies that had been collected and transmitted over the years. The meaning of the word "Hebrew" has proved elusive. It may be related to the verb "to cross over," perhaps meaning "immigrant." Or it might be derived from the name of Abram's ancestor Eber (see Gen 10:14-16).<br>

If so, it would be a very figurative use: "he emptied out" (or perhaps "unsheathed") his men. The LXX has "mustered" (cf. NEB). E. A. Speiser (<i>Genesis</i>, 103-104) suggests reading with the Samaritan Pentateuch a verb <i>diq</i>,<i> </i>cognate with Akkadian <i>deku</i>, "to mobilize" troops. If this view is accepted, one must assume that a confusion of the Hebrew letters <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">d</FONT> (<i>dalet</i>) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">r</FONT> (<i>resh</i>) led to the error in the traditional Hebrew text.

 <a name="fn757" href="gen.htm#fnB757"><sup>46</sup></a><b>sn</b> (14:18)  <i>Salem</i> is traditionally identified as the Jebusite stronghold of old Jerusalem. Accordingly, there has been much speculation about its king. Though some have identified him with the pre-incarnate Christ or with Noah's son Shem, it is far more likely that Melchizedek was a Canaanite royal priest whom God used to renew the promise of the blessing to Abram, perhaps because Abram considered Melchizedek his spiritual superior. But Melchizedek remains an enigma. In a book filled with genealogical records he appears on the scene without a genealogy and then disappears from the narrative. In Psalm 110 the LORD declares that the Davidic king is a royal priest after the pattern of Melchizedek.<br>
 <a name="fn758" href="gen.htm#fnB758"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:18)  The parenthetical disjunctive clause significantly identifies Melchizedek as a priest as well as a king.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (14:18)  It is his royal priestly status that makes Melchizedek a type of Christ: he was identified with Jerusalem, superior to the ancestor of Israel, and both a king and a priest. Unlike the normal Canaanites, this man served "God Most High" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a@l u#ly{/</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/oyl=u# la@</FONT>])--one sovereign God, who was the creator of all the universe.

 <a name="fn761" href="gen.htm#fnB761"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:19)  The terms translated "heaven" and "earth" are both objective genitives after the participle in construct.<br>

Here the noun "reward" is in apposition to "shield" and refers by metonymy to God as the source of the reward. Some translate here "your reward will be very great" (cf. NASB, NRSV), taking the statement as an independent clause and understanding the Hiphil infinitive absolute as a substitute for a finite verb. However, the construction <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">da)m= hB@r+h~</FONT> is never used this way elsewhere, where it either modifies a noun (see the texts listed above) or serves as an adverb in relation to a finite verb (see Josh 13:1; 1 Sam 26:21; 2 Sam 12:30; 2 Kgs 21:16; 1 Chr 20:2; Neh 2:2).<br>

 <a name="fn778" href="gen.htm#fnB778"><sup>8</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:2)  The sentence in the Hebrew text employs a very effective wordplay on the name <i>Damascus</i>: "The son of the acquisition [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">b#/-m#v#q</FONT>] of my house is Eliezer of Damascus [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">D^M#c#q</FONT>]." The words are not the same; they have different sibilants. But the sound play gives the impression that "in the nomen is the omen." Eliezer the Damascene will be Abram's heir if Abram dies childless, because "Damascus" seems to mean that. See M. F.

In the Niphal stem it comes to mean "to be faithful; to be reliable; to be dependable," or, "to be firm; to be sure." In the Hiphil, the form used here, it takes on a declarative sense, "to consider something reliable [or, "dependable"]."

The third feminine singular pronominal suffix refers back to Abram's act of faith, mentioned in the preceding clause.

The verb translated "considered" (<i>Heb</i> "reckoned") also appears with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hq*d&#180;x=</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">x=d*q*h</FONT>, "righteousness") in Ps 106:31. Alluding to the events recorded in Numbers 25, the psalmist notes that Phinehas's actions were "credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come." Reference is made to the unconditional, eternal covenant with which God rewarded Phinehas's loyalty (Num 25:12-13). So <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hq*d&#180;x=</FONT> seems to carry by metonymy the meaning "loyal, rewardable behavior" here, a nuance that fits nicely in Genesis 15, where God responds to Abram's faith by formally ratifying his promise to give Abram and his descendants the land. (See R. B. Chisholm, "Evidence from Genesis," in <i>A Case for Premillennialism</i>, 40. In Phoenician and Old Aramaic inscriptions cognate nouns glossed as "correct, justifiable conduct" sometimes carry this same semantic nuance (<i>DNWSI</i> 962).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (15:6)  This episode is basic to the NT teaching of Paul on justification (Romans 4). Paul weaves this passage and Psalm 32 together, for both use this word. Paul explains that for the one who believes in the LORD, like Abram, God credits him with righteousness but does not credit his sins against him because he is forgiven. Justification does not mean that the believer is righteous; it means that God credits him with righteousness, so that in the records of heaven (as it were) he is declared righteous. See M. G. Kline, "Abram's Amen," <i>WTJ</i> 31 (1968): 1-11.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (15:18)  <i>To your descendants I give this land</i>. The LORD here unconditionally promises that Abram's descendants will possess the land, but he does not yet ratify his earlier promises to give Abram a multitude of descendants and eternal possession of the land.

 <a name="fn827" href="gen.htm#fnB827"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (16:1)  The passage records the birth of Ishmael to Abram through an Egyptian woman. The story illustrates the limits of Abram's faith as he tries to obtain a son through social custom. The barrenness of Sarai poses a challenge to Abram's faith, just as the famine did in chap. 12. As in chap. 12, an Egyptian figures prominently. (Perhaps Hagar was obtained as a slave during Abram's stay in Egypt.)<br>

 <b>sn</b> (16:2)  The Hebrew expression translated <i>have sexual relations with</i> does not convey the intimacy of other expressions, such as "so and so knew his wife." Sarai simply sees this as the social custom of having a child through a surrogate. For further discussion see C. F.

Some identify the angel of the LORD as the preincarnate Christ because in some texts the angel is identified with the LORD himself. However, it is more likely that the angel merely represents the LORD; he can speak for the LORD because he is sent with the LORD's full authority. In some cases the angel is clearly distinct from the LORD (see Judg 6:11-23). It is not certain if the same angel is always in view. Though the proper name following the noun "angel" makes the construction definite, this may simply indicate that a definite angel sent from the LORD is referred to in any given context. It need not be the same angel on every occasion. Note the analogous expression "the servant of the LORD," which refers to various individuals in the OT (see BDB 714).<br>

There has been much debate over the meaning of the name. For discussion see W. F. Albright,<i> </i>"The Names <i>Shaddai</i> and <i>Abram</i>," <i>JBL</i> 54 (1935): 173-210; R. Gordis, "The Biblical Root <i>sdy-sd</i>," <i>JTS</i> 41 (1940): 34-43; and especially T. N. D. Mettinger, <i>In Search of God</i>, 69-72. Shaddai/El Shaddai is the sovereign king of the world who grants, blesses, and judges. In the Book of Genesis he blesses the patriarchs with fertility and promises numerous descendents. Outside Genesis he both blesses/protects and takes away life/happiness. The patriarchs knew God primarily as El Shaddai (Exod 6:3). While the origin and meaning of this name are uncertain (see discussion below) its significance is clear. The name is used in contexts where God appears as the source of fertility and life. In Gen 17:1-8 he appeared to Abram, introduced himself as El Shaddai, and announced his intention to make the patriarch fruitful. In the role of El Shaddai God repeated these words (now elevated to the status of a decree) to Jacob (35:11). Earlier Isaac had pronounced a blessing on Jacob in which he asked El Shaddai to make Jacob fruitful (28:3). Jacob later prayed that his sons would be treated with mercy when they returned to Egypt with Benjamin (43:14). The fertility theme is not as apparent here, though one must remember that Jacob viewed Benjamin as the sole remaining son of the favored and once-barren Rachel (see 29:31; 30:22-24; 35:16-18). It is quite natural that he would appeal to El Shaddai to preserve Benjamin's life, for it was El Shaddai's miraculous power which made it possible for Rachel to give him sons in the first place. In 48:3 Jacob, prior to blessing Joseph's sons, told him how El Shaddai appeared to him at Bethel (see Gen 28) and promised to make him fruitful. When blessing Joseph on his deathbed Jacob referred to Shaddai (we should probably read "El Shaddai," along with a few Hebrew MSS, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the LXX, and Syriac) as the one who provides abundant blessings, including "blessings of the breast and womb" (49:25). (The direct association of the name with "breasts" suggests the name might mean "the one of the breast" [i.e., the one who gives fertility], but the juxtaposition is probably better explained as wordplay. Note the wordplay involving the name and the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ddv</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">v*d*d</FONT>, "destroy"] in Isa 13:6 and in Joel 1:15.) Outside Genesis the name Shaddai (minus the element "El" ["God"]) is normally used when God is viewed as the sovereign king who blesses/protects or curses/brings judgment. The name appears in the introduction to two of Balaam's oracles (Num 24:4, 16) of blessing upon Israel. Naomi employs the name when accusing the Lord of treating her bitterly by taking the lives of her husband and sons (Ruth 1:20-21). In Ps 68:14; Isa 13:6; and Joel 1:15 Shaddai judges his enemies through warfare, while Ps 91:1 depicts him as the protector of his people. (In Ezek 1:24 and 10:5 the sound of the cherubs' wings is compared to Shaddai's powerful voice. The reference may be to the mighty divine warrior's battle cry which accompanies his angry judgment.) Finally, the name occurs 31 times in the Book of Job. Job and his "friends" assume that Shaddai is the sovereign king of the world (11:7; 37:23a) who is the source of life (33:4b) and is responsible for maintaining justice (8:3; 34:10-12; 37:23b). He provides abundant blessings, including children (22:17-18; 29:4-6), but he can also discipline, punish, and destroy (5:17; 6:4; 21:20; 23:16). It is not surprising to see the name so often in this book, where the theme of God's justice is primary and even called into question (24:1; 27:2). The most likely proposal is that the name means "God, the one of the mountain" (an Akkadian cognate means "mountain," to which the Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dv^</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">v^d</FONT>, "breast"] is probably related). For a discussion of proposed derivations see Mettinger, <i>In Search of God</i>, 70-71. The name may originally have depicted God as the sovereign judge who, in Canaanite style, ruled from a sacred mountain. Isa 14:13 and Ezek 28:14, 16 associate such a mountain with God, while Ps 48:2 refers to Zion as "Zaphon," the Canaanite Olympus from which the high god El ruled. (In Isa 14 the Canaanite god El may be in view. Note that Isaiah pictures pagan kings as taunting the king of Babylon, suggesting that pagan mythology may provide the background for the language and imagery.)<br>
 <a name="fn875" href="gen.htm#fnB875"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:1)  Or "Live out your life." The Hebrew verb translated "walk" is the Hitpael; it means "to walk back and forth; to walk about; to live out one's life."<br>

 <a name="fn877" href="gen.htm#fnB877"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:1)  There are two imperatives here: "walk...and be blameless [or, "perfect"]." The second imperative may be purely sequential (see the translation) or consequential: "walk before me and then you will be blameless." How one interprets the sequence depends on the meaning of "walk before": (1) If it simply refers in a neutral way to serving the LORD, then the second imperative is likely sequential. (2) But if it has a positive moral connotation ("serve me faithfully"), then the second imperative probably indicates purpose (or result). For other uses of the idiom see 1 Sam 2:30, 35 and 12:2 (where it occurs twice).<br>
 <a name="fn878" href="gen.htm#fnB878"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:2)  Following the imperative, the cohortative indicates consequence. If Abram is blameless, then the LORD will ratify the covenant. Earlier the LORD ratified part of his promise to Abram (see Gen 15:18-21), guaranteeing him that his descendants would live in the land. But the expanded form of the promise, which includes numerous descendants and eternal possession of the land, remains to be ratified. This expanded form of the promise is in view here (see vv. 2b, 4-8). See the note at Gen 15:18 and R. B. Chisholm, "Evidence from Genesis," in <i>A Case for Premillennialism</i>, 35-54.<br>

 <a name="fn884" href="gen.htm#fnB884"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (17:5)  <i>Your name will be Abraham</i>. The renaming of Abram was a sign of confirmation to the patriarch. Every time the name was used it would be a reminder of God's promise. "Abram" means "exalted father," probably referring to Abram's father Terah. The name looks to the past; Abram came from noble lineage. The name "Abraham" is a dialectical variant of the name Abram. But its significance is in the wordplay with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a^b-h&amp;m{n</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/omh&amp;-ba^</FONT>, "the father of a multitude," which sounds like <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a^b-r*h*m</FONT><i> </i>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;h*r&#180;b=a^</FONT>, "Abraham"). The new name would be a reminder of God's intention to make Abraham the father of a multitude. For a general discussion of renaming, see O.

Some English translations have specified the referent as the LORD (cf. RSV, NIV) based on vv. 1, 13, but the Hebrew text merely has "he said" at this point, referring to one of the three visitors. Aside from the introductory statement in v. 1, the incident is narrated from Abraham's point of view, and the suspense is built up for the reader as Abraham's elaborate banquet preparations in the preceding verses suggest he suspects these are important guests. But not until the promise of a son later in this verse does it become clear who is speaking. In v. 13 the Hebrew text explicitly mentions the LORD.<br>

As long as it was a promise for the future, it really could be believed without much involvement. But now, when it seemed so impossible from the human standpoint, when the LORD fixed an exact date for the birth of the child, the promise became rather overwhelming to Abraham and Sarah. But then this was the LORD of creation, the one they had come to trust. The point of these narratives is that the creation of Abraham's offspring, which eventually became Israel, is no less a miraculous work of creation than the creation of the world itself.<br>

 <a name="fn979" href="gen.htm#fnB979"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:18)  Theoretically the Niphal can be translated either as passive or reflexive/reciprocal. (The Niphal<i> </i>of "bless" is only used in formulations of the Abrahamic covenant. See Gen 12:2; 18:18; 28:14.) Traditionally the verb is taken as passive here, as if Abram were going to be a channel or source of blessing. But in later formulations of the Abrahamic covenant (see Gen 22:18; 26:4) the Hitpael<i> </i>replaces this Niphal form, suggesting a translation "will bless [i.e., "pronounce blessings upon"] themselves [or, "one another"]." The Hitpael of "bless" is used with a reflexive/reciprocal sense in Deut 29:18; Ps 72:17; Isa 65:16; Jer 4:2. Gen 18:18 (like 12:2) predicts that Abraham will be held up as a paradigm of divine blessing and that people will use his name in their blessing formulae. For examples of blessing formulae utilizing an individual as an example of blessing see Gen 48:20 and Ruth 4:11.<br>

That this is indeed the meaning is clear from Lot's warning that they not do so wickedly, and his willingness to give them his daughters instead.

His opposition to the crowds leads to his rejection as a foreigner by those with whom he had chosen to live. The one who attempted to rescue his visitors ends up having to be rescued by them.<br>

The referent of the speaker ("he") is somewhat ambiguous: it could be taken as the angel to whom Lot has been speaking (so NLT; note the singular references in vv. 18-19), or it could be that Lot is speaking directly to the LORD here.

The name of the place, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ru^ox</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">x{u^r</FONT>) apparently means "Little Place," in light of the wordplay with the term "little" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ru*x=m!</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">m!xu*r</FONT>) used twice by Lot to describe the town (v. 20).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (19:28)  It is hard to imagine what was going on in Abraham's mind, but this brief section in the narrative enables the reader to think about the human response to the judgment. Abraham had family in that area. He had rescued those people from the invasion. That was why he interceded. Yet he surely knew how wicked they were. That was why he got the number down to ten when he negotiated with God to save the city. But now he must have wondered, "What was the point?"<br>

Abraham's request (Gen 18:23-32) was that the LORD not destroy the righteous with the wicked. While the requisite minimum number of righteous people (ten, v. 32) needed for God to spare the cities were not found, God nevertheless rescued the righteous before destroying the wicked.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (19:29)  God showed Abraham special consideration because of the covenantal relationship he had established with the patriarch. Yet the reader knows that God delivered the "righteous" (Lot's designation in 2 Pet 2:7) before destroying their world--which is what he will do again at the end of the age.<br>
 <a name="fn1092" href="gen.htm#fnB1092"><sup>83</sup></a><b>sn</b> (19:29)  God's removal of Lot before the judgment is paradigmatic. He typically delivers the godly before destroying their world.<br>

The standards for weighing money varied considerably in the ancient Near East, but the generally accepted weight for the shekel is 11.5 grams (0.4 ounce).

It was surely a rebuke to Sarah. What is amazing is how patient this king was. It is proof that the fear of God was in that place, contrary to what Abraham believed (see v. 11).<br>
 <a name="fn1149" href="gen.htm#fnB1149"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:16)  <i>Heb</i> "Look, it is for you a covering of the eyes, for all who are with you, and with all, and you are set right."

 <a name="fn1153" href="gen.htm#fnB1153"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:1)  The Hebrew verb translated "visit" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">P*q*d</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dqP</FONT>]) often describes divine intervention for blessing or cursing; it indicates God's special attention to an individual or a matter, always with respect to his people's destiny. He may visit (that is, destroy) the Amalekites; he may visit (that is, deliver) his people in Egypt. Here he visits Sarah, to allow her to have the promised child. One's destiny is changed when the LORD "visits." For a more detailed study of the term, see G. Andre, <i>Determining the Destiny: PQD in the Old Testament</i> (Lund: Gleerup, 1980).<br>

 <a name="fn1157" href="gen.htm#fnB1157"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:3)  <i>Heb</i> "the one born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac." The two modifying clauses, the first introduced with an article and the second with the relative pronoun, are placed in the middle of the sentence, before the name Isaac is stated. They are meant to underscore that this was indeed an actual birth to Abraham and Sarah in fulfillment of the promise.<br>
 <a name="fn1158" href="gen.htm#fnB1158"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn </b> (21:4) <i>Heb</i> "Isaac his son, the son of eight days." The name "Isaac" is repeated in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn1159" href="gen.htm#fnB1159"><sup>7</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:4)  <i>Just as God had commanded him to do</i>. With the birth of the promised child, Abraham obeyed the LORD by both naming (Gen 17:19) and circumcising Isaac (17:12).<br>
 <a name="fn1160" href="gen.htm#fnB1160"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:5)  The parenthetical disjunctive clause underscores how miraculous this birth was. Abraham was 100 years old! The fact that the genealogies give the ages of the fathers when their first son is born shows that this was considered a major milestone in one's life (G. Wenham, <i>Genesis 16-50</i>, 80).<br>
 <a name="fn1161" href="gen.htm#fnB1161"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn </b> (21:6) <i>Heb</i> "Laughter God has made for me."<br>

 <a name="fn1163" href="gen.htm#fnB1163"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:6)  Sarah's words play on the name "Isaac" in a final triumphant manner. God prepared "laughter" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">x=j{q</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qj)x=</FONT>]) for her, and everyone who hears about this "will laugh" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">y]xj^q</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qj^x=y]</FONT>]) with her. The laughter now signals great joy and fulfillment, not unbelief (cf. Gen 18:12-15).<br>
 <a name="fn1164" href="gen.htm#fnB1164"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn </b> (21:7) <i>Heb</i> "said."<br>
 <a name="fn1165" href="gen.htm#fnB1165"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:7)  The perfect form of the verb is used here to describe a hypothetical situation.<br>

 <a name="fn1167" href="gen.htm#fnB1167"><sup>15</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:8)  Children were <i>weaned</i> closer to the age of two or three in the ancient world, because infant mortality was high. If an infant grew to this stage, it was fairly certain he or she would live. Such an event called for a celebration, especially for parents who had waited so long for a child.<br>
 <a name="fn1168" href="gen.htm#fnB1168"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn </b> (21:9) <i>Heb</i> "saw."<br>
 <a name="fn1169" href="gen.htm#fnB1169"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:9)  The Piel participle used here is from the same root as the name "Isaac." In the Piel stem the verb means "to jest; to make sport of; to play with," not simply "to laugh," which is the meaning of the verb in the Qal stem. What exactly Ishmael was doing is not clear. Interpreters have generally concluded that the boy was either (1) mocking Isaac (cf. NASB, NIV, NLT) or (2) merely playing with Isaac as if on equal footing (cf. NAB, NRSV). In either case Sarah saw it as a threat. The same participial form was used in Gen 19:14 to describe how some in Lot's family viewed his attempt to warn them of impending doom. It also appears later in Gen 39:14, 17, where Potiphar accuses Joseph of mocking them. <br>
 <b>sn</b> (21:9)  <i>Mocking</i>. Here Sarah interprets Ishmael's actions as being sinister. Ishmael probably did not take the younger child seriously and Sarah saw this as a threat to Isaac. Paul in Gal 4:29 says that Ishmael persecuted Isaac. He uses a Greek word that can mean "to put to flight; to chase away; to pursue" and may be drawing on a rabbinic interpretation of the passage. In Paul's analogical application of the passage, he points out that once the promised child Isaac (symbolizing Christ as the fulfillment of God's promise) has come, there is no room left for the slave woman and her son (who symbolize the Mosaic law).<br>
 <a name="fn1170" href="gen.htm#fnB1170"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:10)  <i>Heb </i>"drive out." The language may seem severe, but Sarah's maternal instincts sensed a real danger in that Ishmael was not treating Isaac with the proper respect.<br>
 <a name="fn1171" href="gen.htm#fnB1171"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:11)  <i>Heb</i> "and the word was very wrong in the eyes of Abraham on account of his son." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">uur</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">r*u*u</FONT>) often refers to what is morally or ethically "evil."  It usage here suggests that Abraham thought Sarah's demand was ethically (and perhaps legally) wrong.<br>
 <a name="fn1172" href="gen.htm#fnB1172"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn </b> (21:12) <i>Heb</i> "Let it not be evil in your eyes."<br>
 <a name="fn1173" href="gen.htm#fnB1173"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:12)  <i>Heb</i> "listen to her voice." The idiomatic expression means "obey; comply." Here her advice, though harsh, is necessary and conforms to the will of God. Later (see Gen 25), when Abraham has other sons, he sends them all away as well.<br>
 <a name="fn1174" href="gen.htm#fnB1174"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:12)  The imperfect verbal form here draws attention to an action that is underway.<br>
 <a name="fn1175" href="gen.htm#fnB1175"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:12)  Or perhaps "will be named"; <i>Heb</i> "for in Isaac offspring will be called to you." The exact meaning of the statement is not clear, but it does indicate that God's covenantal promises to Abraham will be realized through Isaac, not Ishmael.<br>
 <a name="fn1176" href="gen.htm#fnB1176"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:14)  <i>Heb</i> "and Abraham rose up early in the morning and he took."<br>

It is unclear how "and the boy" relates syntactically to what precedes. Perhaps the words should be rearranged and the text read, "and he put [them] on her shoulder and he gave to Hagar the boy."<br>
 <a name="fn1179" href="gen.htm#fnB1179"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn </b> (21:14) <i>Heb</i> "she went and wandered."<br>
 <a name="fn1180" href="gen.htm#fnB1180"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:14)  Or "desert," although for English readers this usually connotes a sandy desert like the Sahara rather than the arid wasteland of this region with its sparse vegetation.<br>
 <a name="fn1181" href="gen.htm#fnB1181"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:15)  <i>Heb</i> "threw," but the child, who was now thirteen years old, would not have been carried, let alone thrown under a bush. The exaggerated language suggests Ishmael is limp from dehydration and is being abandoned to die. See G. Wenham, <i>Genesis 16-50</i>, 85.<br>
 <a name="fn1182" href="gen.htm#fnB1182"><sup>30</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:16)  <i>A bowshot</i> would be a distance of about a hundred yards (ninety meters).<br>

The cohortative verbal form (note the negative particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la^</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a^l</FONT>]) here expresses her resolve to avoid the stated action.<br>
 <a name="fn1185" href="gen.htm#fnB1185"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:16)  <i>Heb </i>"and she lifted up her voice and wept" (that is, she wept uncontrollably). The LXX reads "he" (referring to Ishmael) rather than "she" (referring to Hagar), but this is probably an attempt to harmonize this verse with the following one, which refers to the boy's cries.<br>
 <a name="fn1186" href="gen.htm#fnB1186"><sup>34</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:17)  <i>God heard the boy's voice</i>. The text has not to this point indicated that Ishmael was crying out, either in pain or in prayer. But the text here makes it clear that God heard him. Ishmael is clearly central to the story. Both the mother and the LORD are focused on the child's imminent death.<br>
 <a name="fn1187" href="gen.htm#fnB1187"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn </b> (21:17) <i>Heb</i> "What to you?"<br>

Since the king wanted a treaty to share in Abraham's good fortune, Abraham used the treaty to secure ownership of and protection for the well he dug.

 <a name="fn1237" href="gen.htm#fnB1237"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:8)  <i>Heb</i> "will see for himself." The construction means "to look out for; to see to it; to provide."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (22:8)  <i>God will provide</i> is the central theme of the passage and the turning point in the story. Note Paul's allusion to the story in Rom 8:32 ("how shall he not freely give us all things?") as well as H. J. Schoeps, "The Sacrifice of Isaac in Paul's Theology," <i>JBL</i> 65 (1946): 385-92. <br>
 <a name="fn1238" href="gen.htm#fnB1238"><sup>21</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:9)  <i>Abraham built an altar there</i>. The theme of Abraham's altar building culminates here. He has been a faithful worshiper. Will he continue to worship when called upon to make such a radical sacrifice?<br>
 <a name="fn1239" href="gen.htm#fnB1239"><sup>22</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:9)  <i>Then he tied up</i>. This text has given rise to an important theme in Judaism known as the Aqedah, from the Hebrew word for "binding." When sacrifices were made in the sanctuary, God remembered the binding of Isaac, for which a substitute was offered. See D. Polish, "The Binding of Isaac," <i>Judaica</i> 6 (1957): 17-21.<br>
 <a name="fn1240" href="gen.htm#fnB1240"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn </b> (22:10) <i>Heb</i> "in order to slaughter."<br>
 <a name="fn1241" href="gen.htm#fnB1241"><sup>24</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:11)  <i>Heb</i> "the messenger of the LORD" (also in v. 15). Some identify the angel of the LORD as the preincarnate Christ because in some texts the angel is identified with the LORD himself. However, see the note on the phrase "the LORD's angel" in Gen 16:7.<br>
 <a name="fn1242" href="gen.htm#fnB1242"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn </b> (22:12) <i>Heb</i> "Do not extend your hand toward the boy."<br>
 <a name="fn1243" href="gen.htm#fnB1243"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn </b> (22:12) <i>Heb</i> "and he said, `Do not extend...'"; the referent (the angel) has been specified in the context for clarity. The order of the introductory clause and the direct discourse has been rearranged in the translation for stylistic reasons.<br>
 <a name="fn1244" href="gen.htm#fnB1244"><sup>27</sup></a><b>sn </b> (22:12) <i>For now I know</i>. The test was designed to see if Abraham would be obedient (see v. 1). The angel indicates that God has acquired the information he needs. (This assumes that the angel speaks on behalf of God--note "me" at the end of the verse.) Some theologians call this an anthropomorphism because, they reason, an omniscient God cannot learn new facts since he already knows everything. Others take the language at face value and reason that the God who created human beings with some degree of freedom has placed certain limitations upon himself. For a further discussion of these issues see J. Sanders, <i>The God Who Risks</i> (Downers Grove: IVP, 1998), 52, 74. <br>
 <a name="fn1245" href="gen.htm#fnB1245"><sup>28</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:12)  In this context <i>fear</i> refers by metonymy to obedience that grows from faith.<br>
 <a name="fn1246" href="gen.htm#fnB1246"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn </b> (22:13) <i>Heb</i> "lifted his eyes."<br>
 <a name="fn1247" href="gen.htm#fnB1247"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:13)  <i>Heb</i> "and saw, and look." The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hN}h!</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">h!N@h</FONT>, "look") draws attention to what Abraham saw and invites the audience to view the scene through his eyes.<br>
 <a name="fn1248" href="gen.htm#fnB1248"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tc</b> (22:13)  The translation follows the reading of the MT; a number of Hebrew MSS, the LXX, Syriac, and Samaritan Pentateuch read "one" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dj*a#</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a#j*d</FONT>]) instead of  "behind him" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rj^a^</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a^j^r</FONT>]).<br>
 <a name="fn1249" href="gen.htm#fnB1249"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:13)  <i>Heb</i> "Abraham"; the proper name has been replaced by the pronoun ("he") in the translation for stylistic reasons.<br>
 <a name="fn1250" href="gen.htm#fnB1250"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:14)  <i>Heb</i> "the LORD sees" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ha#r+y] hw&#180;hy+</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">y+hw&#180;h y]ra#h</FONT>], traditionally transliterated "Jehovah Jireh"; see the note on the word "provide" in v. 8). By so naming the place Abraham preserved in the memory of God's people the amazing event that took place there.<br>
 <a name="fn1251" href="gen.htm#fnB1251"><sup>34</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:14)  On the expression <i>to this day</i> see B. Childs, "A Study of the Formula `Until this Day'," <i>JBL</i> 82 (1963): 279-92.<br>
 <a name="fn1252" href="gen.htm#fnB1252"><sup>35</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:14)  The saying connected with these events has some ambiguity, which was probably intended. The Niphal verb could be translated (1) "in the mountain of the LORD it will be seen/provided" or (2) "in the mountain the LORD will appear." If the temple later stood here (see the note on "Moriah" in Gen 22:2), the latter interpretation might find support, for the people went to the temple to appear before the LORD, who "appeared" to them by providing for them his power and blessings. See S. R. Driver, <i>The Book of Genesis</i>, 219.<br>
 <a name="fn1253" href="gen.htm#fnB1253"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn </b> (22:16) <i>Heb</i> "By myself I swear."<br>
 <a name="fn1254" href="gen.htm#fnB1254"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:16)  <i>Heb </i>"the oracle of the LORD." The phrase refers to a formal oracle or decree from the LORD.<br>
 <a name="fn1255" href="gen.htm#fnB1255"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:17)  The use of the infinitive absolute before the finite verbal form (either an imperfect or cohortative) emphasizes the certainty of the blessing.<br>
 <a name="fn1256" href="gen.htm#fnB1256"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:17)  Here too the infinitive absolute is used for emphasis before the following finite verb (either an imperfect or cohortative).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (22:17)  <i>I will greatly multiply</i>. The LORD here ratifies his earlier promise to give Abram a multitude of descendants. For further discussion see R. B. Chisholm, "Evidence from Genesis," in <i>A Case for Premillennialism</i>, 35-54. <br>
 <a name="fn1257" href="gen.htm#fnB1257"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:17)  The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ur~z\</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">z\r^u</FONT>) occurring here and in v. 18 may mean "seed" (for planting), "offspring" (occasionally of animals, but usually of people), or "descendants" depending on the context.<br>
 <a name="fn1258" href="gen.htm#fnB1258"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:17)  Or "inherit."<br>
 <a name="fn1259" href="gen.htm#fnB1259"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:17)  <i>Heb</i> "gate," which here stands for a walled city. To break through the gate complex would be to conquer the city, for the gate complex was the main area of defense (hence the translation "stronghold").<br>
 <a name="fn1260" href="gen.htm#fnB1260"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:18)  In the Hebrew text this causal clause comes at the end of the sentence. The translation alters the word order for stylistic reasons.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (22:18)  <i>Because you have obeyed me</i>. Abraham's obedience brought God's ratification of the earlier conditional promise (see Gen 12:2).<br>
 <a name="fn1261" href="gen.htm#fnB1261"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:18)  Traditionally the verb is taken as passive ("will be blessed") here, as if Abraham's descendants were going to be a channel or source of blessing to the nations. But the Hitpael<i> </i>is better understood here as reflexive/reciprocal, "will bless [i.e., pronounce blessings on] themselves/one another" (see also Gen 26:4). Elsewhere the Hitpael of the verb "to bless" is used with a reflexive/reciprocal sense in Deut 29:18; Ps 72:17; Isa 65:16; Jer 4:2. Gen 12:2 predicts that Abram will be held up as a paradigm of divine blessing and that people will use his name in their blessing formulae. For examples of blessing formulae utilizing an individual as an example of blessing see Gen 48:20 and Ruth 4:11. Earlier formulations of this promise (see Gen 12:2; 18:18) use the Niphal stem. (See also Gen 28:14.)<br>
 <a name="fn1262" href="gen.htm#fnB1262"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn </b> (22:19) <i>Heb</i> "and they arose and went together."<br>
 <a name="fn1263" href="gen.htm#fnB1263"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:19)  <i>Heb</i> "and Abraham stayed in Beersheba. This has been translated as a relative clause for stylistic reasons.<br>
 <a name="fn1264" href="gen.htm#fnB1264"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:20)  In the Hebrew text the sentence begins with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hN}h!</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">h!N@h</FONT>, "look") which draws attention to the statement.<br>
 <a name="fn1265" href="gen.htm#fnB1265"><sup>48</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:21)  This parenthetical note about Kemuel's descendant is probably a later insertion by the author/compiler of Genesis and not part of the original announcement.<br>
 <a name="fn1266" href="gen.htm#fnB1266"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:23)  The disjunctive clause gives information that is important but parenthetical to the narrative. Rebekah would become the wife of Isaac (Gen 24:15).<br>
 <a name="fn1267" href="gen.htm#fnB1267"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:1)  <i>Heb</i> "And the years of Sarah were one hundred years and twenty years and seven years, the years of the life of Sarah."<br>
 <a name="fn1268" href="gen.htm#fnB1268"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:2)  <i>Heb</i> "Sarah." The proper name has been replaced in the translation by the pronoun ("she") for stylistic reasons.<br>
 <a name="fn1269" href="gen.htm#fnB1269"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (23:2)  <i>Mourn...weep</i>. The description here is of standard mourning rites (see "Burial and Mourning," <i>NBD</i> 170-172). They would have been carried out in the presence of the corpse, probably in Sarah's tent. So Abraham came in to mourn; then he rose up to go and bury his dead (v. 3).<br>
 <a name="fn1270" href="gen.htm#fnB1270"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:3)  <i>Heb</i> "And Abraham arose from upon the face of his dead."<br>
 <a name="fn1271" href="gen.htm#fnB1271"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:3)  Some translate the Hebrew term "Heth" as "Hittites" here (also in vv. 5, 7, 10, 16, 18, 20), but this gives the impression that these people were the classical Hittites of Anatolia. However, there is no known connection between these sons of Heth, apparently a Canaanite group (see Gen 10:15), and the Hittites of Asia Minor. See H. A. Hoffner, Jr., "Hittites," in <i>Peoples of the Old Testament World</i> (ed. A. J. Hoerth, G. L. Mattingly, and E. M. Yamauchi; Grand Rapids: Baker, 1996) 152-53.<br>
 <a name="fn1272" href="gen.htm#fnB1272"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:4)  <i>Heb</i> "a resident alien and a settler."<br>
 <a name="fn1273" href="gen.htm#fnB1273"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:4)  <i>Heb</i> "give," which is used here as an idiom for "sell" (see v. 9). The idiom reflects the polite bartering that was done in the culture at the time.<br>
 <a name="fn1274" href="gen.htm#fnB1274"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:4)  Or "possession."<br>
 <a name="fn1275" href="gen.htm#fnB1275"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:4)  Following the imperative, the cohortative with the prefixed conjunction<i> </i>expresses purpose.<br>
 <a name="fn1276" href="gen.htm#fnB1276"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:4)  <i>Heb</i> "bury my dead out of my sight." The last phrase "out of my sight" has not been included in the translation for stylistic reasons.<br>
 <a name="fn1277" href="gen.htm#fnB1277"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:5)  <i>Heb</i> "answered Abraham saying to him."<br>
 <a name="fn1278" href="gen.htm#fnB1278"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:6)  <i>Heb</i> "Hear us, my lord."<br>
 <a name="fn1279" href="gen.htm#fnB1279"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:6)  <i>Heb</i> "prince of God." The divine name may be used here as a means of expressing the superlative, "mighty prince." The word for "prince" probably means "tribal chief" here. See M. H. Gottstein, "<i>Nasi</i>'<i> </i>`<i>elohim</i> (Gen 23:6)," <i>VT</i> 3 (1953) 298-99; and D. W. Thomas, <i>VT</i> 3 (1953) 215-16. <br>
 <a name="fn1280" href="gen.htm#fnB1280"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:6)  The phrase "to prevent you" has been added in the translation for stylistic reasons.<br>
 <a name="fn1281" href="gen.htm#fnB1281"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:7)  <i>Heb</i> "to the people of the land" (also in v. 12).<br>
 <a name="fn1282" href="gen.htm#fnB1282"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:8)  <i>Heb </i>"If it is with your purpose." The Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp#n\</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">n\p#v</FONT>) here has the nuance "purpose" or perhaps "desire" (see BDB 661).<br>
 <a name="fn1283" href="gen.htm#fnB1283"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:8)  <i>Heb</i> "bury my dead out of my sight." The last phrase "out of my sight" has not been included in the translation for stylistic reasons.<br>

 <a name="fn1290" href="gen.htm#fnB1290"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn </b> (23:10) <i>Heb</i> "ears." By metonymy the "ears" stand for the presence or proximity (i.e., within earshot) of the persons named.<br>
 <a name="fn1291" href="gen.htm#fnB1291"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (23:10)  On the expression <i>all who entered the gate</i> see E. A.

 <a name="fn1292" href="gen.htm#fnB1292"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:11)  <i>Heb</i> "give." The perfect tense has here a present nuance; this is a formal, legally binding declaration. Abraham asked only for a burial site/cave within the field; Ephron agrees to sell him the entire field.<br>
 <a name="fn1293" href="gen.htm#fnB1293"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:11)  The Hebrew text adds "to you I give [i.e., sell] it." This is redundant in English and has not been translated for stylistic reasons.<br>

In this case the circumstantial clause ("and a man she had not known") would be restrictive, rather than descriptive. If the term actually means "virgin," one wonders why the circumstantial clause is necessary (see Judg 21:12 as well). Perhaps the repetition emphasizes her sexual purity as a prerequisite for her role as the mother of the covenant community.<br>

The Hebrew word translated "reddish" is <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a^dm{n]</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn]omd+a^</FONT>), which forms a wordplay on the Edomites, Esau's descendants.

 <a name="fn1466" href="gen.htm#fnB1466"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:26)  The disjunctive clause describes an important circumstance accompanying the birth. Whereas Esau was passive at birth, Jacob was active.<br>

The name (since it is a verb) probably means something like "may he protect," that is, as a rearguard, dogging the heels. It did not have a negative connotation until Esau redefined it. This name was probably chosen because of the immediate association with the incident of grabbing the heel. After receiving such an oracle, the parents would have preserved in memory almost every detail of the unusual births.<br>

 <a name="fn1470" href="gen.htm#fnB1470"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:27)  The disjunctive clause juxtaposes Jacob with Esau and draws attention to the striking contrasts. In contrast to Esau, a man of the field, Jacob was civilized, as the phrase "living in tents" signifies. Whereas Esau was a skillful hunter, Jacob was calm and even-tempered (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">T*&lt;</FONT><i> </i>[<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;T*</FONT>], which normally has the idea of "blameless").<br>
 <a name="fn1471" href="gen.htm#fnB1471"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:28)  <i>Heb</i> "the taste of game was in his mouth." The word for "game," "venison" is here the same Hebrew word as "hunter" in the last verse. Here it is a metonymy, referring to that which the hunter kills.<br>
 <a name="fn1472" href="gen.htm#fnB1472"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:28)  The disjunctive clause juxtaposes Rebekah with Jacob and draws attention to the contrast. The verb here is a participle, drawing attention to Rebekah's continuing, enduring love for her son.<br>
 <a name="fn1473" href="gen.htm#fnB1473"><sup>46</sup></a><b>sn</b> (25:29)  <i>Jacob cooked some stew</i>. There are some significant words and wordplays in this story that help clarify the points of the story. The verb "cook" is <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">z]d</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dyz]</FONT>), which sounds like the word for "hunter," <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">x^y]d</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dy]x^</FONT>). This is deliberate, for the hunter becomes the hunted in this story. The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">z]d </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dyz]</FONT>) means "to cook; to boil," but by the soundplay with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">x^y]d</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dy]x^</FONT>) it comes to mean "set a trap by cooking." The usage of the word shows that it can also have the connotation of acting presumptuously (as in boiling over). This too may be a comment on the scene. For further discussion of the rhetorical devices in the Jacob narratives, see J. P. Fokkelman, <i>Narrative Art in Genesis</i>.<br>
 <a name="fn1474" href="gen.htm#fnB1474"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:30)  The rare term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">fu^l*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">l*u^f</FONT>), translated "feed," is used in later Hebrew for feeding animals (see Jastrow, 714). If this nuance was attached to the word in the biblical period, then it may depict Esau in a negative light, comparing him to a hungry animal. Famished Esau comes in from the hunt, only to enter the trap. He can only point at the red stew and ask Jacob to feed him.<br>
 <a name="fn1475" href="gen.htm#fnB1475"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:30)  The verb has no expressed subject and so is given a passive translation.<br>
 <a name="fn1476" href="gen.htm#fnB1476"><sup>49</sup></a><b>sn</b> (25:30)  Esau's descendants would eventually be called <i>Edom</i>. Edom was the place where they lived, so-named probably because of the reddish nature of the hills. The writer can use the word "red" to describe the stew that Esau gasped for to convey the nature of Esau and his descendants. They were a lusty, passionate, and profane people who lived for the moment. Again, the wordplay is meant to capture the "omen in the nomen."<br>
 <a name="fn1477" href="gen.htm#fnB1477"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn </b> (25:31) <i>Heb</i> "today."<br>

There is evidence from Hurrian culture that rights of inheritance were occasionally sold or transferred. Here Esau is portrayed as a profane person who would at the moment rather have a meal than the right to inherit. He will soon forget this trade and seek his father's blessing in spite of it.<br>
 <a name="fn1482" href="gen.htm#fnB1482"><sup>55</sup></a><b>sn</b> (25:34)  The style here is typical of Hebrew narrative; after the tension is resolved with the dialogue, the working out of it is recorded in a rapid sequence of verbs ("gave"; "ate"; "drank"; "got up"; "went out"). See also Gen. 3:1-7 for another example.<br>
 <a name="fn1483" href="gen.htm#fnB1483"><sup>56</sup></a><b>sn</b> (25:34)  <i>So Esau despised his birthright</i>. This clause, which concludes the episode, is a summary statement which reveals the underlying significance of Esau's actions. "To despise" means to treat something as worthless or with contempt. Esau's willingness to sell his birthright was evidence that he considered it to be unimportant.<br>
 <a name="fn1484" href="gen.htm#fnB1484"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn </b> (26:1) <i>Heb</i> "in addition to the first famine which was."<br>
 <a name="fn1485" href="gen.htm#fnB1485"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (26:1)  This account is parallel to two similar stories about Abraham (see Gen 12:10-20; 20:1-18). Many scholars do not believe there were three similar incidents, only one that got borrowed and duplicated. Many regard the account about Isaac as the original, which then was attached to the more important person, Abraham, with supernatural elements being added. For a critique of such an approach, see R. Alter, <i>The Art of Biblical Narrative</i>, 47-62. It is more likely that the story illustrates the proverb "like father, like son" (see T. W. Mann, <i>The Book of the Torah</i>, 53). In typical human fashion the son follows his father's example of lying to avoid problems. The appearance of similar events reported in a similar way underscores the fact that the blessing has now passed to Isaac, even if he fails as his father did.<br>
 <a name="fn1486" href="gen.htm#fnB1486"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (26:2)  <i>Do not go down to Egypt</i>. The words echo Gen 12:10, which reports that "Abram went down to Egypt," but state the opposite.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (26:3)  <i>To you and to your descendants</i>. The Abrahamic blessing will pass to Isaac. Everything included in that blessing will now belong to the son, and in turn will be passed on to his sons. But there is a contingency involved: if they are to enjoy the full blessings, they will have to obey the word of the LORD. And so obedience is enjoined here, with the example of how well Abraham obeyed.<br>
 <a name="fn1491" href="gen.htm#fnB1491"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:3)  The Hiphil stem of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;Wq</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">qW&lt;</FONT>) here means "to fulfill; to bring to realization." For other examples of this use of this verb form, see Lev 26:9; Num 23:19; Deut 8:18; 9:5; 1 Sam 1:23; 1 Kgs 6:12; Jer 11:5.<br>

 <a name="fn1494" href="gen.htm#fnB1494"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:4)  Traditionally the verb is taken as passive ("will be blessed") here, as if Abraham's descendants were going to be a channel or source of blessing to the nations. But the Hitpael<i> </i>is better understood here as reflexive/reciprocal, "will bless [i.e., pronounce blessings on] themselves/one another" (see also Gen 22:18). Elsewhere the Hitpael of the verb "to bless" is used with a reflexive/reciprocal sense in Deut 29:18; Ps 72:17; Isa 65:16; Jer 4:2. Gen 12:2 predicts that Abram will be held up as a paradigm of divine blessing and that people will use his name in their blessing formulae. For examples of blessing formulae utilizing an individual as an example of blessing see Gen 48:20 and Ruth 4:11. Earlier formulations of this promise (see Gen 12:2; 18:18) use the Niphal stem. (See also Gen 28:14.)<br>

 <a name="fn1497" href="gen.htm#fnB1497"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (26:5)  <i>My charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws</i>. The language of this verse is clearly interpretive, for Abraham did not have all these laws. The terms are legal designations for sections of the Mosaic law and presuppose the existence of the law. Some Rabbinic views actually conclude that Abraham had fulfilled the whole law before it was given (see the Mishnah,<i> m. Qiddushin</i> 4:14). Some scholars argue that this story could only have been written after the law was given (C. Westermann, <i>Genesis,</i> 2:424-25). But the simplest explanation is that the narrator (traditionally taken to be Moses the Lawgiver) elaborated on the simple report of Abraham's obedience by using terms with which the Israelites were familiar. In this way he depicts Abraham as the model of obedience to God's commands, whose example Israel should follow.<br>

Here it depicts an action, probably caressing or fondling, that indicated immediately that Rebekah was Isaac's wife, not his sister. Isaac's deception made a mockery of God's covenantal promise. Ignoring God's promise to protect and bless him, Isaac lied to protect himself and acted in bad faith to the men of Gerar.<br>

Since the verb "said" probably means "said to myself" (i.e., "thought") here, the direct discourse in the Hebrew statement has been converted to indirect discourse in the translation. In addition the simple prepositional phrase "on account of her" has been clarified in the translation as "to get her" (cf. v. 7).<br>

According to Gen 21:31 Abraham gave Beersheba its name when he made a treaty with the Philistines. Because of the parallels between this earlier story and the account in 26:26-33, some scholars see chaps. 21 and 26 as two versions (or doublets) of one original story. However, if one takes the text as it stands, it appears that Isaac made a later treaty agreement with the people of the land that was similar to his father's. Abraham dug a well at the site and named the place Beersheba; Isaac dug another well there and named the well Shibah. Later generations then associated the name Beersheba with Isaac, even though Abraham gave the place its name at an earlier time.<br>

It is an invitation to exercise authority his brothers and indicates that he is granted such authority by the patriarch of the family.

The name (since it is a verb) probably means something like "may he protect," that is, as a rearguard, dogging the heels. This name was probably chosen because of the immediate association with the incident of grabbing the heel.

 <a name="fn1677" href="gen.htm#fnB1677"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:11)  <i>Heb</i> "the place." The article may indicate simply that the place is definite in the mind of the narrator. However, as the story unfolds the place is transformed into a holy place. See A. P. Ross, "Jacob's Vision: The Founding of Bethel," <i>BSac</i> 142 (1985): 224-37.<br>
 <a name="fn1678" href="gen.htm#fnB1678"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:11)  <i>Heb</i> "and he spent the night there because the sun had gone down."<br>

 <a name="fn1680" href="gen.htm#fnB1680"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:11)  <i>Heb</i> "and he put [it at] the place of his head." The text does not actually say the stone was placed under his head to serve as a pillow, though most interpreters and translators assume this. Perhaps the stone served some other purpose. Possibly Jacob, who appears to have had a primitive religious mindset, regarded it as a good luck charm or as a magical stone in which a protective spirit resided. Note that later in the story he anticipates the stone becoming the residence of God (see v. 22). Many primitive cultures throughout the world view certain types of stones as magical and/or sacred. See J. G. Frazer, <i>Folklore in the Old Testament</i> (rpt; New York: Hart, 1975) 231-37.<br>

 <a name="fn1683" href="gen.htm#fnB1683"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:12)  <i>Heb</i> "and look." The scene which Jacob witnessed is described in three clauses introduced with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hN}h!</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">h!N@h</FONT>). In this way the narrator invites the reader to witness the scene through Jacob's eyes. Fokkelman points out that the particle goes with a lifted arm and an open mouth: "There, a ladder! Oh, angels! and look, the LORD himself" (J. P. Fokkelman,<i> Narrative Art in Genesis</i>, 51-52).<br>
 <a name="fn1684" href="gen.htm#fnB1684"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:12)  The Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;L*s%</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">s%L*&lt;</FONT>, "ladder," "stairway") occurs only here in the OT, but there appears to be an Akkadian cognate <i>simmiltu</i> (with metathesis of the second and third consonants and a feminine ending) which has a specialized meaning of "stairway, ramp." See H. R. Cohen, <i>Biblical Hapax Legomena in the Light of Akkadian and Ugaritic</i>, 34. For further discussion see C. Houtman, "What Did Jacob See in His Dream at Bethel? Some Remarks on Genesis 28:10-22," <i>VT </i>27 (1977): 337-52; J. G. Griffiths, "The Celestial Ladder and the Gate of Heaven," <i>ExpTim</i> 76 (1964/65): 229-30; and A. R.

 <a name="fn1685" href="gen.htm#fnB1685"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:13)  <i>Heb</i> "the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac." The Hebrew word for "father" can typically be used in a broader sense than the English word, in this case referring to Abraham (who was Jacob's grandfather). For stylistic reasons and for clarity, the words "your father" are supplied with "Isaac" in the translation.<br>
 <a name="fn1686" href="gen.htm#fnB1686"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:13)  The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jr\a#</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a#r#J</FONT>) can mean "[the] earth," "land," "region," "piece of ground," or "ground" depending on the context. Here the term specifically refers to the plot of ground on which Jacob was lying, but at the same time this stands by metonymy for the entire land of Canaan.<br>
 <a name="fn1687" href="gen.htm#fnB1687"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:14)  This is the same Hebrew word translated "ground" in the preceding verse.<br>
 <a name="fn1688" href="gen.htm#fnB1688"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:14)  The verb is singular in the Hebrew; Jacob is addressed as the representative of his descendants.<br>
 <a name="fn1689" href="gen.htm#fnB1689"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:14)  Theoretically the Niphal stem can be translated either as passive or reflexive/reciprocal. (The Niphal<i> </i>of "bless" is only used in formulations of the Abrahamic covenant. See Gen 12:2; 18:18; 28:14.) Traditionally the verb is taken as passive here, as if Jacob were going to be a channel or source of blessing. But in other formulations of the Abrahamic covenant (see Gen 22:18; 26:4) the Hitpael<i> </i>replaces this Niphal form, suggesting a translation "will bless (i.e., pronounce blessings upon) themselves/one another." The Hitpael of "bless" is used with a reflexive/reciprocal sense in Deut 29:18; Ps 72:17; Isa 65:16; Jer 4:2. Gen 28:14 predicts that Jacob will be held up as a paradigm of divine blessing and that people will use his name in their blessing formulae (see Gen 12:2 and 18:18 as well, where Abram/Abraham receives this promise). For examples of blessing formulae utilizing an individual as an example of blessing see Gen 48:20 and Ruth 4:11.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (28:18)  <i>Sacred stone</i>. Such a stone could be used as a boundary marker, a burial stone, or as a shrine. Here the stone is intended to be a reminder of the stairway that was "erected" and on which the LORD "stood." (In Hebrew the word translated "sacred stone" is derived from the verb translated "erected" in v. 12 and "stood" in v. 13. Since the top of the stairway reached the heavens where the LORD stood, Jacob poured oil on the top of the stone. See C. F. Graesser, "Standing Stones in Ancient Palestine," <i>BA</i> 35 (1972): 34-63; and E. Stockton, "Sacred Pillars in the Bible," <i>ABR</i> 20 (1972): 16-32.<br>
 <a name="fn1698" href="gen.htm#fnB1698"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:19)  The name <i>Bethel</i> means "house of God" in Hebrew (see v. 17).<br>

This unusual expression suggests that Jacob had a new lease on life now that God had promised him the blessing he had so desperately tried to gain by his own efforts.

 <a name="fn1722" href="gen.htm#fnB1722"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:10)  <i>Heb</i> "Laban, the brother of his mother." The text says nothing initially about the beauty of Rachel. But the reader is struck by the repetition of "Laban the brother of his mother." Wenham is no doubt correct when he observes that Jacob's primary motive at this stage is to ingratiate himself with Laban (G. Wenham, <i>Genesis 16-50,</i> 231).<br>
 <a name="fn1723" href="gen.htm#fnB1723"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:11)  <i>Heb</i> "and he lifted up his voice and wept." The idiom calls deliberate attention to the fact that Jacob wept out loud.<br>

 <a name="fn1727" href="gen.htm#fnB1727"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn </b> (29:13) <i>Heb</i> "and he told to Laban all these things." This might mean Jacob told Laban how he happened to be there, but Laban's response (see v. 14) suggests "all these things" refers to what Jacob had previously told Rachel (see v. 12).<br>
 <a name="fn1728" href="gen.htm#fnB1728"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:14)  <i>Heb</i> "indeed, my bone and my flesh are you." The expression sounds warm enough, but the presence of "indeed" may suggest that Laban had to be convinced of Jacob's identity before permitting him to stay. To be one's "bone and flesh" is to be someone's blood relative. For example, the phrase describes the relationship between Abimelech and the Shechemites (Judg 9:2; his mother was a Shechemite); David and the Israelites (2 Sam 5:1); David and the elders of Judah (2 Sam 19:12,); and David and his nephew Amasa (2 Sam 19:13, see 2 Sam 17:2; 1 Chr 2:16-17).<br>

 <a name="fn1732" href="gen.htm#fnB1732"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn </b> (29:15) <i>Heb</i> "my brother." The term "brother" is used in a loose sense; actually Jacob was Laban's nephew.<br>

The disjunctive clause (introduced here by a conjunction and a prepositional phrase) provides supplemental material that is important to the story. Since this material is parenthetical in nature, vv. 16-17 have been set in parentheses in the translation.<br>
 <a name="fn1734" href="gen.htm#fnB1734"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:17)  <i>Heb</i> "and the eyes of Leah were tender." The disjunctive clause (introduced here by a conjunction and a noun) continues the parenthesis begun in v. 16. It is not clear what is meant by "tender" (or "delicate") eyes. The expression may mean she had appealing eyes (cf. NAB, NRSV, NLT), though some suggest that they were plain, not having the brightness normally expected. Either way, she did not measure up to her gorgeous sister.<br>

The verb is a cohortative; it may be subordinated to the preceding request, "that I may go in," or it may be an independent clause expressing his desire. The verb "go in" in this context refers to sexual intercourse (i.e., the consummation of the marriage). <br>

 <b>sn</b> (29:23)  <i>His daughter Leah</i>. Laban's deception of Jacob by giving him the older daughter instead of the younger was God's way of disciplining the deceiver who tricked his older brother. Kidner says this account is "the very embodiment of anti-climax, and this moment a miniature of man's disillusion, experienced from Eden onwards" (D. Kidner, <i>Genesis,</i> 160). Von Rad notes, "That Laban secretly gave the unloved Leah to the man in love was, to be sure, a monstrous blow, a masterpiece of shameless treachery...It was certainly a move by which he won for himself far and wide the coarsest laughter" (G. von Rad, <i>Genesis, </i>291). <br>

 <b>sn</b> (29:32)  Leah's explanation of the name Reuben reflects a popular etymology, not an exact one. The name means literally "look, a son." Playing on the Hebrew verb "look," she observes that the LORD has "looked" with pity on her oppressed condition. See further S. R. Driver, <i>Book of Genesis,</i> 273. <br>

The phrase "mighty struggle" reads literally "struggles of God."

 <a name="fn1804" href="gen.htm#fnB1804"><sup>27</sup></a><b>sn</b> (30:13)  The name <i>Asher </i>apparently means "happy one." The name plays on the words used in the statement which appears earlier in the verse.

In direct discourse the more euphemistic "sleep with" was used, but here in the narrative "marital relations" reflects more clearly the emphasis on sexual intercourse.<br>

The name plays on the word used in the statement made earlier in the verse. The Hebrew noun translated "reward" is derived from the same root as the name Issachar. The irony is that Rachel thought the mandrakes would work for her, and she was willing to trade one night for them. But in that one night Leah became pregnant.<br>

A "reproach" is a cutting taunt or painful ridicule, but here it probably refers by metonymy to Rachel's barren condition, which was considered shameful in this culture and was the reason why she was the object of taunting and ridicule.<br>
 <a name="fn1825" href="gen.htm#fnB1825"><sup>48</sup></a><b>sn</b> (30:24)  The name <i>Joseph</i> means "may he add." The name expresses Rachel's desire to have an additional son. In Hebrew the name sounds like the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a*s*[</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[sa</FONT>), translated "taken away" in the earlier statement made in v. 23. So the name, while reflecting Rachel's hope, was also a reminder that God had removed her shame.<br>
 <a name="fn1826" href="gen.htm#fnB1826"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:25)  The perfect verbal form is translated as a past perfect because Rachel's giving birth to Joseph preceded Jacob's conversation with Laban.<br>

Speiser observes, "Laban is delighted with the terms, and promptly proceeds to violate the spirit of the bargain by removing to a safe distance all the grown animals that would be likely to produce the specified sports" (E. A. Speiser, <i>Genesis</i>, 238). Laban apparently thought that by separating out the spotted, striped, and dark colored animals he could minimize the production of spotted, striped, or dark offspring that would then belong to Jacob.<br>
 <a name="fn1860" href="gen.htm#fnB1860"><sup>83</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:36)  The disjunctive clause (introduced by the <i>vav</i> with subject) is circumstantial/temporal; Laban removed the animals while Jacob was taking care of the rest.<br>

It was generally believed that placing such "visual aids" before the animals as they were mating, it was possible to influence the appearance of their offspring. Speiser notes that "Jacob finds a way to outwit his father-in-law, through prenatal conditioning of the flock by visual aids--in conformance with universal folk beliefs" (E. A.

If one is heavy with possessions, then that one is wealthy (13:2). Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph all become wealthy when they left the promised land.

 <b>sn</b> (31:15)  <i>He sold us and...wasted our money</i>. The precise nature of Rachel's and Leah's complaint is not entirely clear. Since Jacob had to work to pay for them, they probably mean that their father has cheated Jacob and therefore cheated them as well. See M.

 <a name="fn1894" href="gen.htm#fnB1894"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn </b> (31:15) <i>Heb</i> "our money." The word "money" is used figuratively here; it means the price paid for Leah and Rachel.

The precise meaning of the expression, which occurs only here and in v. 29, is uncertain. Since Laban proceeded to speak to Jacob at length, it cannot mean to maintain silence. Nor does it seem to be a prohibition against criticism (see vv. 26-30). Most likely it refers to a formal pronouncement, whether it be a blessing or a curse. Laban was to avoid saying anything to Jacob that would be intended to enhance him or to harm him.<br>

The Hebrew verb translated "judge" is plural, suggesting that Laban has more than one "god" in mind. The Samaritan Pentateuch and the LXX, apparently in an effort to make the statement monotheistic, have a singular verb. In this case one could translate, "May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." However, Laban had a polytheistic world view, as evidenced by his possession of household idols (cf. 31:19). The translation uses "God" when referring to Abraham's God, for Genesis makes it clear that Abraham worshiped the one true God. It employs "god" when referring to Nahor's god, for in the Hebrew text Laban refers to a different god here, probably one of the local deities.<br>

This location was a spot where heaven made contact with earth, and where God made his presence known to the patriarch. See C.

The idea includes more than prosperity, though that is its essential meaning. Here the form is subordinated to the preceding imperative and indicates purpose or result. Jacob is reminding God of his promise in the hope that God will honor his word.<br>

The Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lq@m^</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">m^q@l</FONT>), traditionally translated "staff," has been rendered as "walking stick" because a "staff" in contemporary English refers typically to the support personnel in an organization.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (32:12)  Some commentators have thought this final verse of the prayer redundant, but it actually follows the predominant form of a lament in which God is motivated to act. The primary motivation Jacob can offer to God is God's promise, and so he falls back on that at the end of the prayer.<br>

The Hebrew verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rm^a*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a*m^r</FONT>) here represents Jacob's thought or reasoning, and is therefore translated "thought."<br>
 <a name="fn2031" href="gen.htm#fnB2031"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:20)  <i>Heb</i> "I will appease his face." The cohortative here expresses Jacob's resolve. In the Book of Leviticus the Hebrew verb translated "appease" has the idea of removing anger due to sin or guilt, a nuance that fits this passage very well. Jacob wanted to buy Esau off with a gift of more than five hundred and fifty animals.<br>

 <a name="fn2038" href="gen.htm#fnB2038"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:22)  The Hebrew term used here is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dl#y\</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">y\l#d</FONT>) which typically describes male offspring. Some translations render the term "children" but this is a problem because by this time Jacob had twelve children in all, including one daughter, Dinah, born to Leah (Gen 30:21). Benjamin, his twelfth son and thirteenth child, was not born until later (Gen 35:16-19).<br>
 <a name="fn2039" href="gen.htm#fnB2039"><sup>52</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:22)  Hebrew narrative style often includes a summary statement of the whole passage followed by a more detailed report of the event. Here v. 22 is the summary statement, while v. 23 begins the detailed account.<br>

 <a name="fn2042" href="gen.htm#fnB2042"><sup>55</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:24)  The verb translated "wrestled" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">w~Y}a*b@q</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qb@a*Y}w~</FONT>]) sounds in Hebrew like the names "Jacob" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">y~u&amp;q{b</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bq)u&amp;y~</FONT>]) and "Jabbok" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">y~BB{q</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qB)y~</FONT>]). In this way the narrator links the setting, the main action, and the main participant together in the mind of the reader or hearer.<br>

The Hebrew verb translated "struck" has the primary meanings "to touch; to reach; to strike." It can, however, carry the connotation "to harm; to molest; to injure." God's "touch" cripples Jacob--it would be comparable to a devastating blow.<br>

 <a name="fn2050" href="gen.htm#fnB2050"><sup>63</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:26)  Jacob wrestled with a man thinking him to be a mere man, and on that basis was equal to the task. But when it had gone on long enough, the night visitor touched Jacob and crippled him. Jacob's request for a blessing can only mean that he now knew that his opponent was supernatural. Contrary to many allegorical interpretations of the passage that make fighting equivalent to prayer, this passage shows that Jacob stopped fighting, and then asked for a blessing.<br>
 <a name="fn2051" href="gen.htm#fnB2051"><sup>64</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:27)  <i>Heb</i> "and he said to him." The referent of the pronoun "he" (the man who wrestled with Jacob) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>

But since the LORD is going to change Jacob's name, this question is designed to bring focus Jacob's attention on all that his name had come to signify.<br>
 <a name="fn2053" href="gen.htm#fnB2053"><sup>66</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:28)  <i>Heb</i> "and he said." The referent of the pronoun "he" (the man who wrestled with Jacob) has been specified for clarity, and the order of the introductory clause and the direct discourse has been rearranged in the translation for stylistic reasons.<br>
 <a name="fn2054" href="gen.htm#fnB2054"><sup>67</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:28)  The name <i>Israel</i> is a common construction, using a verb with a theophoric element (<i>-el</i>) that usually indicates the subject of the verb. Here it means "God fights." This name will replace the name Jacob; it will be both a promise and a call for faith. In essence, the LORD was saying that Jacob would have victory and receive the promises because God would fight for him.<br>
 <a name="fn2055" href="gen.htm#fnB2055"><sup>68</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:28)  <i>You have fought</i>. The explanation of the name Israel includes a sound play. In Hebrew the verb translated "you have fought" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">c*r!t*</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">t*yr]c*</FONT>]) sounds like the name "Israel" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">y]cr*a@l</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la@r&#180;c=y]</FONT>]), meaning "God fights" (although some interpret the meaning as "he fights [with] God"). The name would evoke the memory of the fight and what it meant. Dillmann says that ever after this the name would tell the Israelites that, when Jacob contended successfully with God, he won the battle with man (Dillmann, <i>Genesis</i>, 2:279). To be successful with God meant that he had to be crippled in his own self-sufficiency (A. P. Ross, "Jacob at the Jabboq, Israel at Peniel," <i>BSac</i> 142 (1985): 51-62).<br>
 <a name="fn2056" href="gen.htm#fnB2056"><sup>69</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:29)  <i>Tell me your name</i>. In primitive thought to know the name of a deity or supernatural being would enable one to use it for magical manipulation or power (A. S. Hebert, <i>Genesis 12-50</i>, 108). For a thorough structural analysis of the passage discussing the plays on the names and the request of Jacob, see R. Barthes, "The Struggle with the Angel: Textual Analysis of Genesis 32:23-33," in <i>Structural Analysis and Biblical Exegesis</i> (ed. R. Barthes, et al.; Pittsburgh: Pickwick, 1974) 21-33.<br>

On the surface Jacob seems to be saying that he saw God and survived. But the statement may have a double meaning, in light of his prayer for deliverance in v. 11. Jacob recognizes that he has survived his encounter with God and that his safety has now been guaranteed.<br>

First, as he said, his herds and children probably could not keep up with the warriors. Second, he probably did not fully trust his brother. The current friendliness could change, and he could lose everything. And third, God did tell him to return to his land, not Seir.

 <a name="fn2110" href="gen.htm#fnB2110"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:20)  <i>Heb</i> "God, the God of Israel." Rather than translating the name, a number of modern translations merely transliterate it from the Hebrew as "El Elohe Israel" (cf. NIV, NRSV, REB). It is not entirely clear how the name should be interpreted grammatically. One option is to supply an equative verb, as in the translation: "The God of Israel [is] God." Another interpretive option is "the God of Israel [is] strong [or, "mighty"]." Buying the land and settling down for a while was a momentous step for the patriarch, so the commemorative naming of the altar is significant.<br>

Here it means that Shechem violated or humiliated Dinah by raping her.<br>
 <a name="fn2115" href="gen.htm#fnB2115"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:3)  <i>Heb</i> "his soul stuck to [or, "joined with"]," meaning Shechem became very attached to Dinah emotionally.<br>

 <a name="fn2124" href="gen.htm#fnB2124"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:7)  The Hebrew verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bxu</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u*x*b</FONT>) can carry one of three semantic nuances depending on the context: (1) "to be injured" (Ps 56:5; Eccl 10:9; 1 Chr 4:10); (2) "to experience emotional pain; to be depressed emotionally; to be worried" (2 Sam. 19:2; Isa 54:6; Neh 8:10-11); (3) "to be embarrassed; to be insulted; to be offended" (to the point of anger at another or oneself; Gen 6:6; 45:5; 1 Sam 20:3, 34; 1 Kgs 1:6; Isa 63:10; Ps 78:40). This third category develops from the second by metonymy. In certain contexts emotional pain leads to embarrassment and/or anger. In this last use the subject sometimes directs his anger against the source of grief (see especially Gen 6:6). The third category fits best in Gen 34:7 because Jacob's sons were not merely wounded emotionally. On the contrary, Shechem's action prompted them to strike out in judgment against the source of their distress.<br>
 <a name="fn2125" href="gen.htm#fnB2125"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:7)  <i>Heb</i> "he"; the referent (Shechem) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>

 <a name="fn2127" href="gen.htm#fnB2127"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:7)  <i>Heb</i> "by lying with the daughter of Jacob." The infinitive here explains the preceding verb, indicating exactly how he had disgraced Jacob. The expression "to lie with" is a euphemism for sexual relations, or in this case, sexual assault.<br>
 <a name="fn2128" href="gen.htm#fnB2128"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:7)  <i>Heb</i> "and so it should not be done." The negated imperfect has an obligatory nuance here, but there is also a generalizing tone. The narrator emphasizes that this particular type of crime (sexual assault) is especially reprehensible.<br>
 <a name="fn2129" href="gen.htm#fnB2129"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:8)  <i>Heb</i> "Shechem my son, his soul is attached to your daughter."  The verb means "to love" in the sense of being emotionally attached to or drawn to someone. This is a slightly different way of saying what was reported earlier (v. 3). However, there is no mention here of the offense. Even though Hamor is speaking to Dinah's brothers, he refers to her as their daughter (see v. 17).<br>

 <a name="fn2192" href="gen.htm#fnB2192"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:8)  "and he called its name." There is no expressed subject, so the verb can be translated as passive.<br>

An oak tree was revered in the ancient world and often designated as a shrine or landmark. This one was named for the weeping (mourning) occasioned by the death of Deborah.<br>
 <a name="fn2194" href="gen.htm#fnB2194"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:10)  <i>Heb</i> "and he called his name Israel." The referent of the pronoun "he" (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (35:10)  The name <i>Israel</i> means "God fights" (although some interpret the meaning as "he fights [with] God"). See Gen 32:28.<br>
 <a name="fn2195" href="gen.htm#fnB2195"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:11)  The name <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yD~v^ la@</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a@l v^DD^y</FONT>, "El Shaddai") has often been translated "God Almighty," primarily because Jerome translated it <i>omnipotens</i> ("all powerful") in the Latin Vulgate. There has been much debate over the meaning of the name. For discussion see W. F. Albright,<i> </i>"The Names <i>Shaddai</i> and <i>Abram</i>," <i>JBL</i> 54 (1935): 173-210; R. Gordis, "The Biblical Root <i>sdy-sd</i>," <i>JTS</i> 41 (1940): 34-43; and especially T. N. D. Mettinger, <i>In Search of God</i>, 69-72. Shaddai/El Shaddai is the sovereign king of the world who grants, blesses, and judges. In the Book of Genesis he blesses the patriarchs with fertility and promises numerous descendents. Outside Genesis he both blesses/protects and takes away life/happiness. The patriarchs knew God primarily as El Shaddai (Exod 6:3). While the origin and meaning of this name are uncertain its significance is clear. The name is used in contexts where God appears as the source of fertility and life. For a fuller discussion see the note on "Sovereign God" in Gen 17:1.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (35:11)  <i>A nation...will descend from you</i>. The promise is rooted in the Abrahamic promise (see Gen 17). God confirms what Isaac told Jacob (see Gen 28:3-4). Here, though, for the first time Jacob is promised kings as descendants.<br>
 <a name="fn2197" href="gen.htm#fnB2197"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:12)  The Hebrew verb translated "gave" refers to the Abrahamic promise of the land.

This passage stands parallel to Gen 28:18-19, where Jacob set up a sacred stone, poured oil on it, and called the place Bethel. Some commentators see these as two traditions referring to the same event, but it is more likely that Jacob reconsecrated the place in fulfillment of the vow he had made here earlier. In support of this is the fact that the present narrative alludes to and is built on the previous one.<br>
 <a name="fn2201" href="gen.htm#fnB2201"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:14)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Esn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">n&#180;s*E</FONT>) means "to pour out; to make libations," and the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Es#n\</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">n\s#E</FONT>) is a "drink-offering," usually of wine or of blood. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qxy</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">y&#180;x*q</FONT>) means "to pour out," often of anointing oil, but of other elements as well.<br>

In view of the previous naming of Bethel in Gen 28:19, here Jacob was confirming or affirming the name through an official ritual marking the fulfillment of the vow. This place now did become Bethel, the house of God.<br>
 <a name="fn2203" href="gen.htm#fnB2203"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:15)  The name <i>Bethel</i> means "house of God" in Hebrew.<br>

 <a name="fn2206" href="gen.htm#fnB2206"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:17)  The construction uses a Hiphil<i> </i>infinitive, which Speiser classifies as an elative Hiphil. The contrast is with the previous Piel: there "she had hard labor," and here, "her labor was at its hardest." Failure to see this, Speiser notes, has led to redundant translations and misunderstandings (E. A. Speiser, <i>Genesis</i>, 273). <br>
 <a name="fn2207" href="gen.htm#fnB2207"><sup>34</sup></a><b>sn</b> (35:17)  <i>Another son</i>. The episode recalls and fulfills the prayer of Rachel at the birth of Joseph (Gen 30:24): "may he add" another son.<br>

 <a name="fn2209" href="gen.htm#fnB2209"><sup>36</sup></a><b>sn</b> (35:18)  The name <i>Ben-Oni</i> means "son of my suffering." It is ironic that Rachel's words to Jacob in Gen 30:1, "Give me children or I'll die," take a different turn here, for it was having the child that brought about her death.<br>
 <a name="fn2210" href="gen.htm#fnB2210"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:18)  The disjunctive clause is contrastive.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (31:46)  <i>His father called him Benjamin</i>. There was a preference for giving children good or positive names in the ancient world, and "son of my suffering" would not do (see the incident in 1 Chr 4:9-10), because it would be a reminder of the death of Rachel (in this connection, see also D. Daube, "The Night of Death," <i>HTR </i>61 <sup>98</sup>: 629-32). So Jacob named him <i>Benjamin</i>, which means "son of the [or, "my"] right hand." The name Benjamin appears in the Mari texts. There have been attempts to connect this name to the resident tribe listed at Mari, "sons of the south" (since the term "right hand" can also mean "south" in Hebrew), but this assumes a different reading of the story. See J. Muilenberg, "The Birth of Benjamin," <i>JBL</i> 75 (1956): 194-201.<br>

Various traditions have identified it as at the shepherds' fields near Bethlehem (the Hebrew name <i>Migdal Eder</i> means "tower of the flock"; see Mic 4:8) or located it near Solomon's pools.<br>
 <a name="fn2215" href="gen.htm#fnB2215"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:22)  <i>Heb</i> "and Reuben went and lay with." The expression "lay with" is a euphemism for having sexual intercourse.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (35:22)  Reuben's act of having <i>sexual relations with Bilhah </i>probably had other purposes than merely satisfying his sexual desire. By having sex with Bilhah, Reuben (Leah's oldest son) would have prevented Bilhah from succeeding Rachel as the favorite wife and by sleeping with his father's concubine he would also be attempting to take over leadership of the clan--something Absalom foolishly attempted later on in Israel's history (2 Sam 16:21-22).<br>

It will list both his actual descendants as well as the people he subsumed under his tribal leadership, people who were aboriginal Edomites. The chapter is long and complicated (see further J. R. Bartlett, "The Edomite King-List of Genesis 36:31-39 and 1 Chronicles 1:43-50," <i>JTS</i> 16 [1965]: 301-14, and W. J. Horowitz, "Were There Twelve Horite Tribes?" <i>CBQ</i> 35 [1973]: 69-71). In the format of the Book of Genesis, the line of Esau is "tidied up" before the account of Jacob is traced (37:2). As such the arrangement makes a strong contrast with Jacob. As Delitzsch says, "secular greatness in general grows up far more rapidly than spiritual greatness" (<i>New Commentary on Genesis</i>, 2:238). In other words, the progress of the world far out distances the progress of the righteous who are waiting for the promise.<br>

"Seir" is both the name of the place and the name of the ancestor of these tribes. The name "Horite" is probably not to be identified with "Hurrian." The clan of Esau settled in this area, intermarried with these Horites and eventually dispossessed them, so that they all became known as Edomites (Deut 2:12 telescopes the whole development).<br>

 <a name="fn2249" href="gen.htm#fnB2249"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (37:1)  The next section begins with the heading <i>This is the account of Jacob</i> in Gen 37:2, so this verse actually forms part of the preceding section as a concluding contrast with Esau and his people. In contrast to all the settled and expanded population of Esau, Jacob was still moving about in the land without a permanent residence and without kings. Even if the Edomite king list was added later (as the reference to kings in Israel suggests), its placement here in contrast to Jacob and his descendants is important. Certainly the text deals with Esau before dealing with Jacob--that is the pattern. But the detail is so great in chap. 36 that the contrast cannot be missed.<br>
 <a name="fn2250" href="gen.htm#fnB2250"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:2)  <i>Heb</i> "a son of seventeen years." The word "son" is in apposition to the name "Joseph."<br>

 <b>sn</b> (37:2)  Some interpreters portray Joseph as a tattletale for bringing back <i>a bad report about them</i> [i.e., his brothers], but the entire Joseph story has some of the characteristics of wisdom literature. Joseph is presented in a good light--not because he was perfect, but because the narrative is showing how wisdom rules. In light of that, this section portrays Joseph as faithful to his father in little things, even though unpopular--and so he will eventually be given authority over greater things.<br>
 <a name="fn2255" href="gen.htm#fnB2255"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:3)  The disjunctive clause provides supplemental information vital to the story. It explains in part the brothers' animosity toward Joseph.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (37:3)  The statement <i>Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons</i> brings forward a motif that played an important role in the family of Isaac--parental favoritism. Jacob surely knew what that had done to him and his brother Esau, and to his own family. But now he showers affection on Rachel's son Joseph.<br>
 <a name="fn2256" href="gen.htm#fnB2256"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn </b> (37:3) <i>Heb</i> "a son of old age was he to him." This expression means "a son born to him when he [i.e., Jacob] was old."<br>

The idea that it was a coat of many colors comes from the Greek translation of the OT. An examination of cognate terms in Semitic suggests it was either a coat or tunic with long sleeves (cf. NEB, NRSV), or a tunic that was richly embroidered (cf. NIV). It set Joseph apart as the favored one.<br>

But here there is a hint of uneasiness--they hated him <i>because of his dream and because of his words</i>. The dream bothered them, as well as his telling them. And their words in the rhetorical question are ironic, for this is exactly what would happen. The dream was God's way of revealing it.<br>

Thus the term refers to a woman who did not marry, but was dedicated to temple service as a cult prostitute. The masculine form of this noun is used for male cult prostitutes. Judah thought he had gone to an ordinary prostitute (v. 15); but Hirah went looking for a cult prostitute, perhaps because it had been a sheep-shearing festival. For further discussion see E. M.

Though deceptive, it was a desperate and courageous act. For Tamar it was within her rights; she did nothing that the law did not entitle her to do.

 <a name="fn2377" href="gen.htm#fnB2377"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (38:29)  <i>Heb</i> "How you have made a breach for yourself!" The Hebrew verb translated "make a breach" frequently occurs, as here, with a cognate accusative. The event provided the meaningful name Perez, "he who breaks through."<br>
 <a name="fn2378" href="gen.htm#fnB2378"><sup>55</sup></a><b>sn</b> (38:29)  The name <i>Perez</i> means "he who breaks through," referring to Perez reaching out his hand at birth before his brother was born. The naming signified the completion of Tamar's struggle and also depicted the destiny of the tribe of Perez who later became dominant (Gen 46:12 and Num 26:20). Judah and his brothers had sold Joseph into slavery, thinking they could thwart God's plan that the elder brothers should serve the younger. God demonstrated that principle through these births in Judah's own family, affirming that the elder will serve the younger, and that Joseph's leadership could not so easily be set aside. See J. Goldin, "The Youngest Son; or, Where Does Genesis 38 Belong?" <i>JBL</i> 96 (1977): 27-44.<br>
 <a name="fn2379" href="gen.htm#fnB2379"><sup>56</sup></a><b>sn</b> (38:30)  Perhaps the child was named <i>Zerah</i> because of the <i>scarlet thread</i>. Though the Hebrew word used for "scarlet thread" in v. 28 is not related to the name Zerah, there is a related root in Babylonian and western Aramaic that means "scarlet" or "scarlet thread." In Hebrew the name appears to be derived from a root meaning "to shine." The name could have originally meant something like "shining one" or "God has shined." Zerah became the head of a tribe (Num 26:20) from whom Achan descended (Josh 7:1).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (39:7)  The story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife has long been connected with the wisdom warnings about the strange woman who tries to seduce the young man with her boldness and directness (see Prov 5-7, especially 7:6-27). This is part of the literary background of the story of Joseph that gives it a wisdom flavor. See G. von Rad, "The Story of Joseph," in <i>God at Work in Israel</i> (Nashville: Abingdon, 1974) 19-35; and G. W.

 <a name="fn2414" href="gen.htm#fnB2414"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (39:14)  The verb has no expressed subject, and so it could be treated as a passive ("a Hebrew man was brought in"; cf. NIV). But it is clear from the context that her husband brought Joseph into the household, so Potiphar is the apparent referent here. Thus the translation supplies "my husband" as the referent of the unspecified pronominal subject of the verb (cf. NEB, NRSV).<br>

 <a name="fn2428" href="gen.htm#fnB2428"><sup>49</sup></a><b>sn</b> (39:20)  The story of Joseph is filled with cycles and repetition: He has two dreams (chap. 37), he interprets two dreams in prison (chap. 40) and the two dreams of Pharaoh (chap. 41), his brothers make two trips to see him (chaps. 42-43), and here, for the second time (see 37:24), he is imprisoned for no good reason, with only his coat being used as evidence.

But evidence from Akkadian texts shows that in early times the title was used of a court official in general. Only later did it become more specialized in its use.<br>
 <a name="fn2438" href="gen.htm#fnB2438"><sup>5</sup></a><b>sn</b> (40:4)  <i>He served them</i>. This is the same Hebrew verb, meaning "to serve as a personal attendant," that was translated "became [his] servant" in 39:4.<br>

The perfect verbal form may be used rhetorically here to emphasize Joseph's desire to be remembered. He speaks of the action as already being accomplished in order to make it clear that he expects it to be done. The form can be translated as volitional, expressing a plea or a request.<br>
 <a name="fn2454" href="gen.htm#fnB2454"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:14)  This perfect verbal form with the prefixed conjunction (and the two that immediately follow) carry the same force as the preceding perfect.<br>

The implication is that Joseph would be pleased for them to tell his story and give him the credit due him so that Pharaoh would release him. Since Pharaoh had never met Joseph, the simple translation of "cause him to remember me" would mean little.<br>
 <a name="fn2457" href="gen.htm#fnB2457"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:14)  <i>Heb</i> "house." The word "prison" has been substituted in the translation for clarity.<br>

 <a name="fn2463" href="gen.htm#fnB2463"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:20)  The translation puts the verb in quotation marks because it is used rhetorically here and has a double meaning.

 <b>sn</b> (41:7)  Pharaoh's two dreams, as explained in the following verses, pertained to the economy of Egypt. Because of the Nile River, the land of Egypt weathered all kinds of famines--there was usually grain in Egypt, and if there was grain and water the livestock would flourish. These two dreams, however, indicated that poverty would overtake plenty and that the blessing of the herd and the field would cease.<br>

The theme of fruitfulness is connected with this line of the family from Rachel (30:2) on down (see Gen 49:22, Deut 33:13-17, and Hos 13:15). But there is some difficulty with the name "Ephraim" itself. It appears to be a dual, for which Delitzsch simply said it meant "double fruitfulness" (<i>A New Commentary on Genesis</i>, 2:305). G. J. Spurrell suggested it was a diphthongal pronunciation of a name ending in <i>-an</i> or <i>-am</i>, often thought to be dual suffixes (see <i>Diblayim</i> in Hos 1:3; <i>Notes on Genesis</i>, 334). Many, however, simply connect the name to the territory of Ephraim and interpret it to be "fertile land" (C. Fontinoy, "Les noms de lieux en <i>-ayim</i> dans la Bible, <i>UF</i> 3 [1971]: 33-40). The dual would then be an old locative ending. There is no doubt that the name became attached to the land in which the tribe settled, and it is possible that is where the dual ending came from, but in this story it refers to Joseph's God-given fruitfulness.<br>

 <a name="fn2680" href="gen.htm#fnB2680"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (43:14)  <i>Heb</i> "if I am bereaved I am bereaved." With this fatalistic sounding statement Jacob resolves himself to the possibility of losing both Benjamin and Simeon.<br>

The Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb*u@oT</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Tou@b*h</FONT>, "abomination") describes something that is loathsome or off-limits.

The imperfect verbal form in the explanatory clause is taken as habitual in force, indicating a practice that was still in effect in the narrator's time.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (43:32)  That the Egyptians found eating with foreigners disgusting is well-attested in extra-biblical literature by writers like Herodotus, Diodorus, and Strabo.<br>

 <a name="fn2722" href="gen.htm#fnB2722"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (44:5)  <i>Heb</i> "Is this not what my master drinks from." The word "cup" is not in the Hebrew text, but is obviously the referent of "this," and so has been supplied in the translation for clarity.<br>

Jacob closely associates God with an angelic protective presence. This does not mean that Jacob viewed his God as a mere angel, but it does suggest that he was aware of an angelic presence sent by God to protect him. Here he so closely associates the two that they become virtually indistinguishable. In this culture messengers typically carried the authority of the one who sent them and could even be addressed as such. Perhaps Jacob thought that the divine blessing would be mediated through this angelic messenger.<br>

It is used for buying someone out of bondage, marrying a deceased brother's widow, paying off debts, avenging the family, and the like. The meanings of "deliver, protect, avenge" are most fitting when God is the subject (see A. R. Johnson, "The Primary Meaning of the Root <i>Ga</i>'<i>al</i>," VTSup 1 [1953]: 67-77).<br>

Jacob was giving Joseph either (1) one portion above his brothers, or (2) the mountain ridge he took from the Amorites, or (3) Shechem. The ambiguity actually allows for all three to be the referent. He could be referring to the land in Shechem he bought in Gen 33:18-19, but he mentions here that it was acquired by warfare, suggesting that the events of 34:25-29 are in view (even though at the time he denounced it, 34:30). Joseph was later buried in Shechem (Josh. 24:32).<br>

The contents of some of the sayings in this chapter stretch from the immediate circumstances to the time of the settlement in the land to the coming of Messiah. There is a great deal of literature on this chapter, including among others C. Armerding, "The Last Words of Jacob: Genesis 49," <i>BSac</i> 112 (1955): 320-28; H. Pehlke, "An Exegetical and Theological Study of Genesis 49:1-28," unpublished Th.D. dissertation, Dallas Theological Seminary, 1985; and B.

 <a name="fn2927" href="gen.htm#fnB2927"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:4)  The Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">zj^P^</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">P^j^z</FONT>) only occurs here in the OT. A related verb occurs twice in the prophets (Jer 23:32; Zeph 3:4) for false prophets inventing their messages, and once in Judges for unscrupulous men bribed to murder (Judg 9:4). It would describe Reuben as being "frothy, boiling, turbulent" as water. The LXX has "run riot;" the Vulgate has "poured out;" and <i>Targum Onqelos</i> has "you followed your own direction." It is a reference to Reuben's misconduct in Gen 35, but the simile and the rare word invite some speculation. Pehlke suggests "destructive like water," for Reuben acted with pride and presumption.<br>
 <a name="fn2928" href="gen.htm#fnB2928"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:4)  <i>Heb</i> "Do not excel!" The Hiphil of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rt^y&#180;</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">y&#180;t^r</FONT>) has this meaning only here. The negated jussive is rhetorical here. Rather than being a command, it anticipates what will transpire. The prophecy says that because of the character of the ancestor, the tribe of Reuben would not have the character to lead (see 1 Chr 5:1).<br>
 <a name="fn2929" href="gen.htm#fnB2929"><sup>5</sup></a><b>sn</b> (49:4)  This is a euphemism for having sexual intercourse with Jacob's wives (see Gen 35:22).<br>
 <a name="fn2930" href="gen.htm#fnB2930"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:4)  The last verb is third masculine singular, as if for the first time Jacob told the brothers, or let them know that he knew. For a discussion of this passage see S. Gevirtz, "The Reprimand of Reuben," <i>JNES</i> 30 (1971): 87-98.<br>
 <a name="fn2931" href="gen.htm#fnB2931"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:5)  The meaning of the Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hr&#180;k@m=</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">m=k@r*h</FONT>) is uncertain. It has been rendered (1) "habitations"; (2) "merchandise"; (3) "counsels"; (4) "swords"; (5) "wedding feasts." If it is from the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">trK</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">K*r^t</FONT>) and formed after noun patterns for instruments and tools (<i>maqtil, miqtil</i> form), then it would refer to "knives." Since the verb is used in Exod 4:25 for circumcision, the idea would be "their circumcision knives," an allusion to the events of Gen 34 (see M. J. Dahood, "`MKRTYHM' in Genesis 49,5," <i>CBQ</i> 23 [1961]: 54-56). Another explanation also connects the word to the events of Gen 34 as a reference to the intended "wedding feast" for Dinah which could take place only after the men of Shechem were circumcised (see D. W. Young, "A Ghost Word in the Testament of Jacob (Gen 49:5)?" <i>JBL</i> 100 [1981]: 335-422).<br>
 <a name="fn2932" href="gen.htm#fnB2932"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:6)  The Hebrew text reads "my glory," but it is preferable to repoint the form and read "my liver." The liver was sometimes viewed as the seat of the emotions and will (see <i>HALOT</i> 456) for which the heart is the modern equivalent.<br>
 <a name="fn2933" href="gen.htm#fnB2933"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (49:7)  <i>Divide...scatter</i>. What is predicted here is a division of their tribes. Most commentators see here an anticipation of Levi being in every area but not their own. That may be part of it, but not entirely what the curse intended. These tribes for their ruthless cruelty would be eliminated from the power and prestige of leadership.<br>
 <a name="fn2934" href="gen.htm#fnB2934"><sup>10</sup></a><b>sn</b> (49:8)  There is a wordplay here; the name <i>Judah</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">y+hWd*h</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hd&#180;Why+</FONT>]) sounds in Hebrew like the verb translated <i>praise</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">yodW;</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;Wdoy</FONT>]). The wordplay serves to draw attention to the statement as having special significance.<br>
 <a name="fn2935" href="gen.htm#fnB2935"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:10)  Or perhaps "from his descendants," taking the expression "from between his feet" as a euphemism referring to the genitals. In this case the phrase refers by metonymy to those who come forth from his genitals, i.e., his descendants.<br>
 <a name="fn2936" href="gen.htm#fnB2936"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:10)  The Hebrew form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hOyv!</FONT> is a major interpretive problem. There are at least four major options (with many variations and less likely alternatives): (1) Some prefer to leave the text as it is, reading "Shiloh" and understanding it as the place where the ark rested for a while in the time of the Judges (see D. E. Schley, <i>Shiloh</i>, JSOTSup 63 [Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1989]). (2) By repointing the text others arrive at the translation "until the [or, "his"] ruler comes," a reference to a Davidic ruler or the Messiah. (3) Another possibility that does not require emendation of the consonantal text, but only repointing, is "until tribute is brought to him" (so NEB, JPS, NRSV), which has the advantage of providing good parallelism with the following line, "the nations will obey him." (4) The interpretation followed in the present translation, "to whom it [belongs]" (so RSV, NIV, REB), is based on the ancient versions. Again, this would refer to the Davidic dynasty or, ultimately, to the Messiah.<br>
 <a name="fn2937" href="gen.htm#fnB2937"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:10)  "and to him [will be] the obedience of the nations." For discussion of this verse see J.

 <a name="fn2938" href="gen.htm#fnB2938"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:11)  The perfect verbal form is used rhetorically, describing coming events as though they have already taken place.<br>
 <a name="fn2939" href="gen.htm#fnB2939"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:12)  Some translate these as comparatives, "darker than wine...whiter than milk," and so a reference to his appearance (so NEB, NIV, NRSV). But if it is in the age of abundance, symbolized by wine and milk, then the dark (i.e., red or perhaps dull) eyes would be from drinking wine, and the white teeth from drinking milk.<br>
 <a name="fn2940" href="gen.htm#fnB2940"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:13)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/k^v*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">v*k^/</FONT>) means "to settle," but not necessarily as a permanent dwelling place.

 <a name="fn2941" href="gen.htm#fnB2941"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:15)  The verb forms in this verse ("sees," "will bend," and "[will] become") are preterite; they is used in a rhetorical manner, describing the future as if it had already transpired.<br>
 <a name="fn2942" href="gen.htm#fnB2942"><sup>18</sup></a><b>sn</b> (49:15)  The oracle shows that the tribe of Issachar will be willing to trade liberty for the material things of life. Issachar would work (<i>become a slave laborer</i>) for the Canaanites, a reversal of the oracle on Canaan. See C. M. Carmichael, "Some Sayings in Genesis 49," <i>JBL</i> 88 (1969): 435-44; and S. Gevirtz, "The Issachar Oracle in the Testament of Jacob," ErIsr 12 (1975): 104-112.<br>
 <a name="fn2943" href="gen.htm#fnB2943"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (49:16)  The name <i>Dan</i> means "judge" and forms a wordplay with the following verb.<br>

 <a name="fn2945" href="gen.htm#fnB2945"><sup>21</sup></a><b>sn</b> (49:17)  The comparison of the tribe of <i>Dan</i> to a venomous <i>serpent</i> is meant to say that Dan, though small, would be potent, gaining victory through its skill and shrewdness. Jewish commentators have linked the image in part with Samson. That link at least illustrates the point: though a minority tribe, Dan would gain the upper hand over others.<br>
 <a name="fn2946" href="gen.htm#fnB2946"><sup>22</sup></a><b>sn</b> (49:18)  <i>I wait for your deliverance, O </i>LORD. As Jacob sees the conflicts that lie ahead for Dan and Gad (see v. 19), he offers a brief prayer for their security.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (49:19)  In Hebrew the name <i>Gad</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">G&#180;d</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dG&#180;</FONT>]) sounds like the words translated "raided" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">y+gWd#NW</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WNd\Wgy+</FONT>]) and "marauding bands" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">G+dWd</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dWdG+</FONT>]).<br>

 <a name="fn2949" href="gen.htm#fnB2949"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:20)  The Hebrew word translated "rich," when applied to products of the ground, means abundant in quantity and quality.<br>
 <a name="fn2950" href="gen.htm#fnB2950"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:20)  The word translated "delicacies" refers to foods that were delightful, the kind fit for a king.<br>

 <a name="fn2952" href="gen.htm#fnB2952"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:21)  <i>Heb</i> "the one who gives words of beauty." The deer imagery probably does not continue into this line; Naphtali is the likely antecedent of the substantival participle, which is masculine, not feminine, in form. If the animal imagery is retained from the preceding line, the image of a talking deer is preposterous. For this reason some read the second line "the one who bears beautiful fawns," interpreting <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yr}m=a!</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a!mr@</FONT>) as a reference to young animals, not words (see <i>HALOT</i> 67).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (49:21)  Almost every word in the verse is difficult. Some take the imagery to mean that Naphtali will be swift and agile (like a <i>doe</i>), and be used to take good messages (reading "words of beauty"). Others argue that the tribe was free-spirited (<i>free running</i>), but then settled down with young children.<br>
 <a name="fn2953" href="gen.htm#fnB2953"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:22)  The Hebrew text appears to mean "[is] a son of fruitfulness." The second word is an active participle, feminine singular, from the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hr&#180;P*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">P*r*h</FONT>, "to be fruitful"). The translation "bough" is employed for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/B@</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">B@/</FONT>, elsewhere typically "son") because Joseph is pictured as a healthy and fruitful vine growing by the wall. But there are difficulties with this interpretation. The word "son" nowhere else refers to a plant and the noun translated "branches" (<i>Heb</i> "daughters") in the third line is a plural form whereas its verb is singular. In the other oracles of Gen 49 an animal is used for comparison and not a plant, leading some to translate the opening phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrP /B</FONT> ("fruitful bough") as "wild donkey" (JPS, NAB). Various other interpretations involving more radical emendation of the text have also been offered.<br>

 <a name="fn2960" href="gen.htm#fnB2960"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn </b> (49:25) <i>Heb</i> "Shaddai." See the note on the title "Sovereign God" in Gen 17:1. The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta@</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a@t</FONT>) in the Hebrew text should probably be emended to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la@</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a@l</FONT>), "God."<br>

 <a name="fn2964" href="gen.htm#fnB2964"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:26)  One could interpret the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yr~oh</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">hor^y</FONT>) to mean "my progenitors" (literally, "the ones who conceived me"), but the masculine form argues against this. It is better to emend the text to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yr}r&amp;h^</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">h^r&amp;r@y</FONT>, "mountains of") because it forms a better parallel with the next clause. In this case the final <i>yod</i> on the form is a construct plural marker, not a pronominal suffix.<br>
 <a name="fn2965" href="gen.htm#fnB2965"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:26)  For further discussion of this passage, see I. Sonne, "Genesis 49:24-26," <i>JBL</i> 65 (1946): 303-306.<br>

However, there is no known connection between these sons of Heth, apparently a Canaanite group (see Gen 10:15), and the Hittites of Asia Minor. See H. A. Hoffner, Jr., "Hittites," in <i>Peoples of the Old Testament World</i> (ed. A. J. Hoerth, G. L. Mattingly, and E. M. Yamauchi; Grand Rapids: Baker, 1996) 152-53.<br>

 <a name="fn2985" href="gen.htm#fnB2985"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (50:10)  The location of <i>the threshing floor of Atad</i> is not certain. The expression <i>the other side of the Jordan </i>could refer to the eastern or western bank, depending on one's perspective. However, it is commonly used in the OT for Transjordan. This would suggest that the entourage came up the Jordan Valley and crossed into the land at Jericho, just as the Israelites would in the time of Joshua.<br>
 <a name="fn2986" href="gen.htm#fnB2986"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (50:10)  <i>Heb</i> "and they mourned there [with] very great and heavy mourning." The cognate accusative, as well as the two adjectives and the adverb, emphasize the degree of their sorrow.<br>

 <a name="fn2993" href="gen.htm#fnB2993"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (50:16)  The verb means "command," but they would hardly be commanding him. It probably means they sent their father's instructions to Joseph.<br>
