<a name="_Toc494011916"></a><p><i>David Learns of the Deaths of Saul and Jonathan</i>
<p><A NAME="1"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> After the death of Saul,<a name="fnB0" href="2sa_note.htm#fn0"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> when David had returned from defeating the Amalekites,<a name="fnB1" href="2sa_note.htm#fn1"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> he stayed at Ziklag<a name="fnB2" href="2sa_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> for two days. 
<bqverse 2>2  On the third day a man arrived from the camp of Saul with his clothes torn and dirt on his head.<a name="fnB3" href="2sa_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> When he approached David, the man<a name="fnB4" href="2sa_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> fell to the ground.<a name="fnB5" href="2sa_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 3>3  David asked him, "Where are you coming from?" He replied, "I have escaped from the camp of Israel." 
<bqverse 4>4  David inquired, "How were things going?<a name="fnB6" href="2sa_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> Tell me!" He replied, "The people fled from the battle and many of them<a name="fnB7" href="2sa_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> fell dead.<a name="fnB8" href="2sa_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> Even Saul and his son Jonathan are dead." 
<bqverse 5>5  David said to the young man<a name="fnB9" href="2sa_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> who was telling him this, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"<a name="fnB10" href="2sa_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  The young man who was telling him this<a name="fnB11" href="2sa_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> said, "I just happened to be on Mount Gilboa and came across Saul leaning on his spear for support. The chariots and leaders of the horsemen were in hot pursuit of him. 
<bqverse 7>7  When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me. I answered, `Here I am!' 
<bqverse 8>8 He asked me, `Who are you?' I told him, `I'm<a name="fnB12" href="2sa_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> an Amalekite.' 
<bqverse 9>9  He said to me, `Stand over me and put me to death.<a name="fnB13" href="2sa_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> I'm very dizzy,<a name="fnB14" href="2sa_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> even though I'm still alive.'<a name="fnB15" href="2sa_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  So I stood over him and put him to death, since I knew that he couldn't live in such a condition.<a name="fnB16" href="2sa_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> Then I took the crown which was on his head and the<a name="fnB17" href="2sa_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> bracelet which was on his arm. I have brought them here to my lord."<a name="fnB18" href="2sa_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 11>11  David then grabbed his own clothes<a name="fnB19" href="2sa_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> and tore them, as did all the men who were with him. 
<bqverse 12>12  They lamented and wept and fasted until evening because Saul, his son Jonathan, the LORD's people, and the house of Israel had fallen by the sword.<p>

<bqverse 13>13  David said to the young man who told this to him, "Where are you from?" He replied, "I am an Amalekite, the son of a resident foreigner."<a name="fnB20" href="2sa_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  David replied to him, "How is it that you were not afraid to reach out your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?" 
<bqverse 15>15  Then David called one of the soldiers<a name="fnB21" href="2sa_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> and said, "Come here and strike him down!" So he struck him down, and he died. 
<bqverse 16>16  David said to him, "Your blood be on your own head! Your own mouth has testified against you, saying `I have put the LORD's anointed to death.'" <a name="_Toc494011917"></a></p>
<p><i>David</i>'<i>s Tribute to Saul and Jonathan</i>
<p>
<bqverse 17>17  Then David chanted this lament over Saul and his son Jonathan. 
<bqverse 18>18  (He gave instructions that the people of Judah should be taught "The Bow."<a name="fnB22" href="2sa_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> Indeed, it is written down in the Book of Yashar.<a name="fnB23" href="2sa_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a>)</p>
<br>
<bqverse 19>19  The beauty<a name="fnB24" href="2sa_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> of Israel lies slain on your high places!<br>
How the mighty have fallen!<br>

<bqverse 20>20  Don't report it in Gath,<br>
don't spread the news in the streets of Ashkelon,<a name="fnB25" href="2sa_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a><br>
or the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice,<br>
the daughters of the uncircumcised will celebrate!<br>

<bqverse 21>21  O mountains of Gilboa, <br>
may there be no dew or rain on you, nor fields of grain offerings!<a name="fnB26" href="2sa_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a><br>
For it was there that the shield of warriors was defiled;<a name="fnB27" href="2sa_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a><br>
the shield of Saul lies neglected without oil.<a name="fnB28" href="2sa_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 22>22  From the blood of the slain, from the fat of warriors,<br>
the bow of Jonathan was not turned away.<br>
The sword of Saul never returned<a name="fnB29" href="2sa_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> empty.<br>

<bqverse 23>23  Saul and Jonathan were greatly loved<a name="fnB30" href="2sa_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> during their lives,<br>
and not even in their deaths were they separated.<br>
They were swifter than eagles, stronger than lions.<br>

<bqverse 24>24  O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,<br>
who clothed you in scarlet<a name="fnB31" href="2sa_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> as well as jewelry,<br>
who put gold jewelry on your clothes.<br>

<bqverse 25>25  How have the warriors fallen<br>
in the midst of battle!<br>
Jonathan lies slain on your high places!<br>

<bqverse 26>26  I grieve over you, my brother Jonathan!<br>
You were very dear to me.<br>
Your love was more special to me than the love of women.<br>

<bqverse 27>27  How the warriors have fallen!<br>
The weapons of war<a name="fnB32" href="2sa_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> are destroyed!
<bqchapter 2>
<a name="_Toc494011918"></a></ul><p><i>David is Anointed King</i>
<p><A NAME="2"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Afterward David inquired of the LORD, "Should I go up to one of the cities of Judah?" The LORD told him, "Go up." David asked, "Where should I go?" The LORD replied,<a name="fnB33" href="2sa_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> "To Hebron." 
<bqverse 2>2  So David went up, along with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail, formerly the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 
<bqverse 3>3  David also brought along the men who were with him, each with his family. They settled in the cities<a name="fnB34" href="2sa_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> of Hebron.
<bqverse 4>4  The men of Judah came and there they anointed David as king over the people<a name="fnB35" href="2sa_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> of Judah.<p>
David was told,<a name="fnB36" href="2sa_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> "The people<a name="fnB37" href="2sa_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> of Jabesh Gilead are the ones who buried Saul." 
<bqverse 5>5  So David sent messengers to the people of Jabesh Gilead and told them, "May you be blessed by the LORD because you have shown this kindness<a name="fnB38" href="2sa_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> to your lord Saul by burying him. 
<bqverse 6>6  Now may the LORD show you true kindness!<a name="fnB39" href="2sa_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> I also will reward you,<a name="fnB40" href="2sa_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> because you have done this deed. 
<bqverse 7>7  Now be courageous<a name="fnB41" href="2sa_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> and prove to be valiant warriors, for your lord Saul is dead. The people of Judah have anointed me as king over you." <a name="_Toc494011919"></a></p>
<p><i>David</i>'<i>s Army Clashes with the Army of Saul</i>
<p>
<bqverse 8>8  Now Abner son of Ner, the general of Saul's army, had taken Saul's son Ish-bosheth<a name="fnB42" href="2sa_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and had brought him to Mahanaim. 
<bqverse 9>9  He appointed him king over Gilead, the Geshurites,<a name="fnB43" href="2sa_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, and all Israel. 
<bqverse 10>10  Ish-bosheth son of Saul was forty years old when he began to rule over Israel. He ruled two years. However, the people<a name="fnB44" href="2sa_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> of Judah followed David. 
<bqverse 11>11  David was king in Hebron over the people of Judah for seven and a half years.<a name="fnB45" href="2sa_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 12>12  Then Abner son of Ner and the servants of Ish-bosheth son of Saul went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 
<bqverse 13>13  Joab son of Zeruiah and the servants of David also went out and confronted them at the pool of Gibeon. One group stationed themselves on one side of the pool, and the other group on the other side of the pool. 
<bqverse 14>14  Abner said to Joab, "Let the soldiers arise and fight<a name="fnB46" href="2sa_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> before us." Joab said, "So be it."<a name="fnB47" href="2sa_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 15>15  So they arose and crossed over by number: twelve belonging to Benjamin and to Ish-bosheth son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David. 
<bqverse 16>16  As they grappled with one another, each one stabbed his opponent with his sword and they fell dead together.<a name="fnB48" href="2sa_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> So that place is called the Field of Flints; it is in Gibeon. <p>

<bqverse 17>17  Now the battle was very severe that day; Abner and the men of Israel were overcome by David's soldiers.<a name="fnB49" href="2sa_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  The three sons of Zeruiah were there--Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was as quick on his feet as one of the gazelles in the field. 
<bqverse 19>19  Asahel chased Abner, without turning to the right or to the left as he followed Abner.<p>

<bqverse 20>20  Then Abner turned and asked, "Is that you, Asahel?" He replied, "Yes it is!" 
<bqverse 21>21  Abner said to him, "Turn aside to your right or to your left. Capture one of the soldiers<a name="fnB50" href="2sa_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and take his equipment for yourself!" But Asahel was not willing to turn aside from following him. 
<bqverse 22>22  So Abner spoke again to Asahel, "Turn aside from following me! I do not want to strike you to the ground.<a name="fnB51" href="2sa_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> How then could I show<a name="fnB52" href="2sa_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> my face in the presence of Joab your brother?" 
<bqverse 23>23  But he refused to turn aside. So Abner struck him in the belly with the back end of his<a name="fnB53" href="2sa_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> spear. The spear came out his back; he collapsed on the spot and died there right before him. Everyone who now comes to the place where Asahel fell dead pauses in respect.<a name="fnB54" href="2sa_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 24>24  So Joab and Abishai chased Abner. At sunset they came to the hill of Ammah near Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon. 
<bqverse 25>25  The Benjamites formed their ranks<a name="fnB55" href="2sa_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> behind Abner and were like a single army, standing at the top of a certain hill.<p>

<bqverse 26>26  Then Abner called out to Joab, "Must the sword devour forever? Don't you realize that this will turn bitter in the end? When will you tell the people to turn aside from pursuing their brothers?" 
<bqverse 27>27  Joab replied, "As surely as God lives, if you had not spoken it would have been morning before the people would have abandoned pursuit<a name="fnB56" href="2sa_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> of their brothers!" 
<bqverse 28>28  Then Joab blew the ram's horn and all the people stopped in their tracks.<a name="fnB57" href="2sa_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> They stopped chasing Israel and ceased fighting.<a name="fnB58" href="2sa_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 29>29  Abner and his men went through the Arabah all that night. They crossed the Jordan River<a name="fnB59" href="2sa_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> and went through the whole region of Bitron<a name="fnB60" href="2sa_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> and came to Mahanaim.<p>

<bqverse 30>30  Now Joab returned from chasing Abner and gathered all the people. Nineteen of David's soldiers were missing, in addition to Asahel. 
<bqverse 31>31  But David's soldiers had slaughtered the Benjaminites and Abner's men--in all, three hundred and sixty men had died! 
<bqverse 32>32  They took Asahel's body and buried him in his father's tomb at Bethlehem. Joab and his men then traveled all that night and reached Hebron by dawn. 
<bqchapter 3><A NAME="3"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> However, the war was prolonged between the house of Saul and the house of David. David was becoming steadily stronger, while the house of Saul was becoming increasingly weaker.<p>

<bqverse 2>2  Now sons were born to David in Hebron. His firstborn was Amnon, born to Ahinoam the Jezreelite. 
<bqverse 3>3  His second son<a name="fnB61" href="2sa_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> was Kileab, born to Abigail the widow<a name="fnB62" href="2sa_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> of Nabal the Carmelite. His third son was Absalom, the son of Maacah daughter of King Talmai of Geshur. 
<bqverse 4>4  His fourth son was Adonijah, the son of Haggith. His fifth son was Shephatiah, the son of Abitail. 
<bqverse 5>5  His sixth son was Ithream, born to David's wife Eglah. These sons<a name="fnB63" href="2sa_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> were all born to David in Hebron. <a name="_Toc494011920"></a></p>
<p><i>Abner Defects to David</i>'<i>s Camp</i>
<p>
<bqverse 6>6  As the war continued between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner was becoming more influential<a name="fnB64" href="2sa_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> in the house of Saul. 
<bqverse 7>7  Now Saul had a concubine named Rizpah daughter of Aiah. Ish-bosheth<a name="fnB65" href="2sa_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> said to Abner, "Why did you have sexual relations<a name="fnB66" href="2sa_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> with my father's concubine?"<a name="fnB67" href="2sa_note.htm#fn67"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 8>8  These words of Ish-bosheth really angered Abner and he said, "Am I the head of a dog that belongs to Judah? This very day I am demonstrating<a name="fnB68" href="2sa_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> loyalty to the house of Saul your father and to his relatives<a name="fnB69" href="2sa_note.htm#fn69"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a><i> </i>and his friends! I have not betrayed you into the hand of David. Yet you have accused me of sinning with this woman today!<a name="fnB70" href="2sa_note.htm#fn70"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  God will severely judge Abner<a name="fnB71" href="2sa_note.htm#fn71"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> if I do not do for David exactly what the LORD has promised him,<a name="fnB72" href="2sa_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10 namely, to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah all the way from Dan to Beersheba!" 
<bqverse 11>11  Ish-bosheth<a name="fnB73" href="2sa_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> was unable to answer Abner with even a single word because he was afraid of him.<p>

<bqverse 12>12  Then Abner sent messengers<a name="fnB74" href="2sa_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> to David saying, "To whom does the land belong? Make an agreement<a name="fnB75" href="2sa_note.htm#fn75"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> with me, and I will do whatever I can<a name="fnB76" href="2sa_note.htm#fn76"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> to cause all Israel to turn to you." 
<bqverse 13>13  So David said, "Good! I will make an agreement with you. I ask only one thing from you. You will not see my face unless you bring Saul's daughter Michal when you come to visit me."<a name="fnB77" href="2sa_note.htm#fn77"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 14>14  David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth son of Saul with this demand:<a name="fnB78" href="2sa_note.htm#fn78"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> "Give me my wife Michal whom I acquired<a name="fnB79" href="2sa_note.htm#fn79"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> for a hundred Philistine foreskins." 
<bqverse 15>15  So Ish-bosheth took her<a name="fnB80" href="2sa_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> from her husband Paltiel<a name="fnB81" href="2sa_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> son of Laish. 
<bqverse 16>16  Her husband went along behind her, weeping all the way to Bahurim. Finally Abner said to him, "Go back!"<a name="fnB82" href="2sa_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> So he returned home.<p>

<bqverse 17>17  Abner advised<a name="fnB83" href="2sa_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> the elders of Israel, "Previously you were desiring David to be your king.<a name="fnB84" href="2sa_note.htm#fn84"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  Act now! For the LORD has said to David, `By the hand of my servant David I will save<a name="fnB85" href="2sa_note.htm#fn85"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> my people Israel from<a name="fnB86" href="2sa_note.htm#fn86"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> the Philistines and from all their enemies.'"<p>

<bqverse 19>19  Then Abner spoke privately<a name="fnB87" href="2sa_note.htm#fn87"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> with the Benjaminites. Abner also went to Hebron to inform David privately<a name="fnB88" href="2sa_note.htm#fn88"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> of all that Israel and the entire house of Benjamin had agreed to.<a name="fnB89" href="2sa_note.htm#fn89"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  When Abner, accompanied by twenty men, came to David in Hebron, David prepared a banquet for Abner and the men who were with him. 
<bqverse 21>21  Abner said to David, "Let me leave so that I may go and gather all Israel to my lord the king so that they may make an agreement<a name="fnB90" href="2sa_note.htm#fn90"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> with you. Then you will rule over all that you desire." So David sent Abner away, and he left in peace.<a name="_Toc494011921"></a></p>
<p><i>Abner Is Killed</i>
<p>
<bqverse 22>22  Now David's soldiers<a name="fnB91" href="2sa_note.htm#fn91"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> and Joab were coming back from a raid, bringing a great deal of plunder with them. Abner was no longer with David in Hebron, for David<a name="fnB92" href="2sa_note.htm#fn92"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> had sent him away and he had left in peace. 
<bqverse 23>23  When Joab and all the army that was with him arrived, Joab was told: "Abner the son of Ner came to the king; he sent him away, and he left in peace!"<p>

<bqverse 24>24  So Joab went to the king and said, "What have you done? Abner<a name="fnB93" href="2sa_note.htm#fn93"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> has come to you! Why would you send him away? Now he's gone on his way!<a name="fnB94" href="2sa_note.htm#fn94"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  You know Abner the son of Ner! Surely he came here to spy on you and to determine when you leave and when you return<a name="fnB95" href="2sa_note.htm#fn95"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> and to discover everything that you are doing!"<p>

<bqverse 26>26  Then Joab left David and sent messengers after Abner. They brought him back from the well of Sirah. (But David was not aware of it.) 
<bqverse 27>27  When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside at the gate as if to speak privately with him. Joab then stabbed him<a name="fnB96" href="2sa_note.htm#fn96"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> in the stomach and killed him, avenging the shed blood of his brother Asahel.<a name="fnB97" href="2sa_note.htm#fn97"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 28>28  When David later heard about this, he said, "I and my kingdom are forever innocent before the LORD of the shed blood of Abner son of Ner! 
<bqverse 29>29  May his blood whirl over<a name="fnB98" href="2sa_note.htm#fn98"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> the head of Joab and the entire house of his father!<a name="fnB99" href="2sa_note.htm#fn99"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> May the house of Joab never cease to have<a name="fnB100" href="2sa_note.htm#fn100"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> someone with a running sore or a skin disease or one who works at the spindle<a name="fnB101" href="2sa_note.htm#fn101"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> or one who falls by the sword or one who lacks food!" <p>

<bqverse 30>30  So Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel in Gibeon during the battle.<p>

<bqverse 31>31  David instructed Joab and all the people who were with him, "Tear your clothes! Put on sackcloth! Lament before Abner!" Now King David followed<a name="fnB102" href="2sa_note.htm#fn102"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> behind the funeral bier. 
<bqverse 32>32  So they buried Abner in Hebron. The king cried loudly<a name="fnB103" href="2sa_note.htm#fn103"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> over Abner's grave and all the people wept too. 
<bqverse 33>33 The king chanted the following lament for Abner:</p>
<br>"Should Abner have died like a fool?<br>

<bqverse 34>34  Your hands<a name="fnB104" href="2sa_note.htm#fn104"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> were not bound,<br>
and your feet were not put into irons.<br>
You fell the way one falls before criminals."</ul><p>All the people<a name="fnB105" href="2sa_note.htm#fn105"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> wept over him again. 
<bqverse 35>35  Then all the people came and encouraged David to eat food while it was still day. But David took an oath saying, "God will punish me severely<a name="fnB106" href="2sa_note.htm#fn106"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> if I taste bread or anything whatsoever before the sun sets!"<p>

<bqverse 36>36  All the people noticed this and it pleased them.<a name="fnB107" href="2sa_note.htm#fn107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> In fact, everything the king did pleased all the people. 
<bqverse 37>37  All the people and all Israel realized on that day that the killing of Abner the son of Ner was not done at the king's instigation.<a name="fnB108" href="2sa_note.htm#fn108"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 38>38  Then the king said to his servants, "Do you not realize that a great leader<a name="fnB109" href="2sa_note.htm#fn109"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> has fallen this day in Israel? 
<bqverse 39>39  Today I am weak, even though I am anointed as king. These men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too much for me to bear.<a name="fnB110" href="2sa_note.htm#fn110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> May the LORD punish appropriately the one who has done this evil thing!"<a name="fnB111" href="2sa_note.htm#fn111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqchapter 4>
<a name="_Toc494011922"></a></p>
<p><i>Ish-bosheth is killed</i>
<p><A NAME="4"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> When Ish-bosheth<a name="fnB112" href="2sa_note.htm#fn112"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> the son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he was very disheartened,<a name="fnB113" href="2sa_note.htm#fn113"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> and all Israel was afraid. 
<bqverse 2>2  Now Saul's son<a name="fnB114" href="2sa_note.htm#fn114"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> had two men who were in charge of raiding units; one's name was Baanah and the other's name was Recab. They were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, who was a Benjaminite. (Beeroth is regarded as belonging to Benjamin, 
<bqverse 3>3  for the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have remained there as resident foreigners until the present time.<a name="fnB115" href="2sa_note.htm#fn115"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a>)<p>

<bqverse 4>4  Now Saul's son Jonathan had a son who was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan arrived from Jezreel. His nurse lifted him and fled; but in her haste to get away, he fell and was injured.<a name="fnB116" href="2sa_note.htm#fn116"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> Mephibosheth was his name. <p>

<bqverse 5>5  Now the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite--Recab and Baanah--went at the hottest part of the day to the home of Ish-bosheth, as he was enjoying his midday rest. 
<bqverse 6>6  They<a name="fnB117" href="2sa_note.htm#fn117"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> entered the house under the pretense of getting wheat and mortally wounded him<a name="fnB118" href="2sa_note.htm#fn118"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> in the stomach. Then Recab and his brother Baanah escaped.<p>

<bqverse 7>7  They had entered<a name="fnB119" href="2sa_note.htm#fn119"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> the house while he<a name="fnB120" href="2sa_note.htm#fn120"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> was resting on his bed in his bedroom. They mortally wounded him<a name="fnB121" href="2sa_note.htm#fn121"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and then cut off his head.<a name="fnB122" href="2sa_note.htm#fn122"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> Taking his head,<a name="fnB123" href="2sa_note.htm#fn123"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> they traveled on the way of the Arabah all that night. 
<bqverse 8>8  They brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David in Hebron, saying to the king, "Look! The head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, your enemy who sought your life! The LORD has granted vengeance to my lord the king this day against<a name="fnB124" href="2sa_note.htm#fn124"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> Saul and his descendants!"<p>

<bqverse 9>9  David replied to Recab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, "As surely as the LORD lives, who has delivered my life from all adversity, 
<bqverse 10>10  when the one who told me that Saul was dead--even though he thought he was bringing good news<a name="fnB125" href="2sa_note.htm#fn125"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a>--I seized him and killed him in Ziklag. That was the good news I gave to him! 
<bqverse 11>11  Surely when wicked men have killed an innocent man as he slept<a name="fnB126" href="2sa_note.htm#fn126"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> in his own house, should I not now require his blood from your hands and remove<a name="fnB127" href="2sa_note.htm#fn127"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> you from the earth?"<p>

<bqverse 12>12  Then David issued orders to the soldiers and they put them to death. They then cut off their hands and their feet and hung them<a name="fnB128" href="2sa_note.htm#fn128"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> near the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth<a name="fnB129" href="2sa_note.htm#fn129"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and buried it in the tomb of Abner<a name="fnB130" href="2sa_note.htm#fn130"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> in Hebron.<a name="fnB131" href="2sa_note.htm#fn131"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqchapter 5>
<a name="_Toc494011923"></a></p>
<p><i>David Is Anointed King Over Israel</i>
<p><A NAME="5"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> All the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron saying, "Look, we are your very flesh and blood!<a name="fnB132" href="2sa_note.htm#fn132"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  In the past, when Saul was our king, you were Israel's general.<a name="fnB133" href="2sa_note.htm#fn133"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> The LORD said to you, `You will shepherd my people Israel; you will rule over Israel.'" <p>

<bqverse 3>3  When all the leaders<a name="fnB134" href="2sa_note.htm#fn134"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> of Israel came to the king at Hebron, King David made an agreement with them<a name="fnB135" href="2sa_note.htm#fn135"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> in Hebron before the LORD. They designated<a name="fnB136" href="2sa_note.htm#fn136"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> David as king over Israel. 
<bqverse 4>4  David was thirty years old when he began to reign and he reigned for forty years. 
<bqverse 5>5  In Hebron he reigned over Judah for seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned for thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah. <a name="_Toc494011924"></a></p>
<p><i>David Occupies Jerusalem</i>
<p>
<bqverse 6>6  Then the king and his men advanced to Jerusalem against the Jebusites who lived in the land. The Jebusites<a name="fnB137" href="2sa_note.htm#fn137"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> said to David, "You cannot invade this place! Even the blind and the lame will turn you back, saying, `David cannot invade this place!'" <p>

<bqverse 7>7  But David captured the fortress of Zion (that is, the city of David). 
<bqverse 8>8  David said on that day, "Whoever attacks the Jebusites must approach by the water tunnel<a name="fnB138" href="2sa_note.htm#fn138"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> the `lame' and the `blind' who are David's enemies." <a name="fnB139" href="2sa_note.htm#fn139"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> For this reason it is said, "The blind and the lame cannot enter the palace."<a name="fnB140" href="2sa_note.htm#fn140"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 9>9  So David lived in the fortress and called it the City of David. David built all around it, from the terrace inwards. 
<bqverse 10>10  David's power steadily grew, for the LORD God<a name="fnB141" href="2sa_note.htm#fn141"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> who leads armies<a name="fnB142" href="2sa_note.htm#fn142"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> was with him.<a name="fnB143" href="2sa_note.htm#fn143"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 11>11  King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar logs, carpenters, and stonemasons. They built a palace<a name="fnB144" href="2sa_note.htm#fn144"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> for David. 
<bqverse 12>12  David realized that the LORD had established him as king over Israel and that he had elevated his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel. 
<bqverse 13>13  David married more concubines and wives from Jerusalem after he arrived from Hebron. Even more sons and daughters were born to David. 
<bqverse 14>14  These are the names of children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
<bqverse 15>15  Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 
<bqverse 16>16  Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet. <a name="_Toc494011925"></a></p>
<p><i>Conflict with the Philistines</i>
<p>
<bqverse 17>17  When the Philistines heard that David had been designated<a name="fnB145" href="2sa_note.htm#fn145"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> king over Israel, they all<a name="fnB146" href="2sa_note.htm#fn146"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> went up to search for David. When David heard about it, he went down to the fortress. 
<bqverse 18>18  Now the Philistines had come and had spread out in the valley of Rephaim. 
<bqverse 19>19  So David asked the LORD, "Should I march up against the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?" The LORD said to David, "March up, for I will indeed<a name="fnB147" href="2sa_note.htm#fn147"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> hand the Philistines over to you."<p>

<bqverse 20>20  So David marched against Baal Perazim and defeated them there. Then he said, "The LORD has burst out against my enemies like water bursts out." So he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.<a name="fnB148" href="2sa_note.htm#fn148"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  The Philistines<a name="fnB149" href="2sa_note.htm#fn149"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> left their idols<a name="fnB150" href="2sa_note.htm#fn150"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> there, and David and his men picked them up.<p>

<bqverse 22>22  The Philistines again came up and spread out in the valley of Rephaim. 
<bqverse 23>23  So David asked the LORD what he should do.<a name="fnB151" href="2sa_note.htm#fn151"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> This time<a name="fnB152" href="2sa_note.htm#fn152"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD<a name="fnB153" href="2sa_note.htm#fn153"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> said to him, "Don't march straight up. Instead, circle around behind them and come against them opposite the trees.<a name="fnB154" href="2sa_note.htm#fn154"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  When you hear sound of marching in the tops of the trees, act decisively. For at that moment the LORD is going before you to strike down the army<a name="fnB155" href="2sa_note.htm#fn155"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> of the Philistines." 
<bqverse 25>25  David did just as the LORD commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.<a name="fnB156" href="2sa_note.htm#fn156"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>David Brings the Ark to Jerusalem</i>
<p><A NAME="6"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> David again assembled<a name="fnB157" href="2sa_note.htm#fn157"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> all the best<a name="fnB158" href="2sa_note.htm#fn158"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> men in Israel, thirty thousand in number. 
<bqverse 2>2  David and all the men who were with him traveled<a name="fnB159" href="2sa_note.htm#fn159"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> to<a name="fnB160" href="2sa_note.htm#fn160"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> Baalah<a name="fnB161" href="2sa_note.htm#fn161"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> in Judah to bring up from there the ark of God which is called by the name<a name="fnB162" href="2sa_note.htm#fn162"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> of the LORD of hosts, who sits enthroned between the cherubim that are on it. 
<bqverse 3>3  They loaded the ark of God on a new cart and carried it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart. 
<bqverse 4>4 They brought<a name="fnB163" href="2sa_note.htm#fn163"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> it up from the house of Abinadab on the hill, along with the ark of God. Ahio was walking in front of the ark, 
<bqverse 5>5  while David and all Israel<a name="fnB164" href="2sa_note.htm#fn164"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> were energetically celebrating before the LORD, singing<a name="fnB165" href="2sa_note.htm#fn165"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> and playing various stringed instruments,<a name="fnB166" href="2sa_note.htm#fn166"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> tambourines, rattles,<a name="fnB167" href="2sa_note.htm#fn167"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> and cymbals.<p>

<bqverse 6>6  When they arrived at the threshing floor of Nacon,<a name="fnB168" href="2sa_note.htm#fn168"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> Uzzah reached out and grabbed<a name="fnB169" href="2sa_note.htm#fn169"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> the ark of God,<a name="fnB170" href="2sa_note.htm#fn170"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> because the oxen stumbled. 
<bqverse 7>7  The LORD was so furious with Uzzah,<a name="fnB171" href="2sa_note.htm#fn171"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> he<a name="fnB172" href="2sa_note.htm#fn172"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> killed him right there for his negligence.<a name="fnB173" href="2sa_note.htm#fn173"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> He died right there next to the ark of God. <p>

<bqverse 8>8  David was angry because the LORD attacked<a name="fnB174" href="2sa_note.htm#fn174"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> Uzzah; so he called that place Perez Uzzah,<a name="fnB175" href="2sa_note.htm#fn175"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> which remains its name to this very day. 
<bqverse 9>9  David was afraid of the LORD that day and said, "How will the ark of the LORD ever come to me?" 
<bqverse 10>10  So David was no longer willing to bring the ark of the LORD to be with him in the City of David. David left it in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. 
<bqverse 11>11  The ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite for three months. The LORD blessed Obed-Edom and all his family.<a name="fnB176" href="2sa_note.htm#fn176"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  David was told,<a name="fnB177" href="2sa_note.htm#fn177"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> "The LORD has blessed the family of Obed-Edom and everything he owns because of the ark of God." So David went and joyfully brought the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the City of David. 
<bqverse 13>13  Those who carried the ark of the LORD took six steps and then David<a name="fnB178" href="2sa_note.htm#fn178"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> sacrificed an ox and a fatling calf. 
<bqverse 14>14  Now David, wearing a linen ephod, was dancing with all his strength before the LORD.<a name="fnB179" href="2sa_note.htm#fn179"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  David and all Israel<a name="fnB180" href="2sa_note.htm#fn180"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> were bringing up the ark of the LORD, shouting and blowing trumpets.<a name="fnB181" href="2sa_note.htm#fn181"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 16>16  As the ark of the LORD entered the City of David, Saul's daughter Michal looked out the window. When she saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, she despised him.<a name="fnB182" href="2sa_note.htm#fn182"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  They brought the ark of the LORD and put it in its place<a name="fnB183" href="2sa_note.htm#fn183"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> in the middle of the tent which David had pitched for it. Then David offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before the LORD. 
<bqverse 18>18  When David finished offering burnt sacrifices and peace offerings, he pronounced a blessing over the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.

<bqverse 1>1 </b> Later the king of the Ammonites died and his son Hanun succeeded him.<a name="fnB292" href="2sa_note.htm#fn292"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  David said, "I will express my loyalty<a name="fnB293" href="2sa_note.htm#fn293"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> to Hanun son of Nahash just as his father was loyal<a name="fnB294" href="2sa_note.htm#fn294"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> to me." So David sent his servants with a message expressing sympathy over his father's death.<a name="fnB295" href="2sa_note.htm#fn295"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> When David's servants entered the land of the Ammonites, 
<bqverse 3>3  the Ammonite officials said to their lord Hanun, "Do you really think David is trying to honor your father by sending these messengers to express his sympathy?<a name="fnB296" href="2sa_note.htm#fn296"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> No, David has sent his servants to you to get information about the city and spy on it so they can overthrow it!"<a name="fnB297" href="2sa_note.htm#fn297"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 4>4 So Hanun seized David's servants and shaved off half of each one's beard. He cut the lower part of their robes off so that their buttocks were exposed,<a name="fnB298" href="2sa_note.htm#fn298"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> and then sent them away. 
<bqverse 5>5 Messengers<a name="fnB299" href="2sa_note.htm#fn299"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> told David what had happened,<a name="fnB300" href="2sa_note.htm#fn300"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> so he summoned them, for the men were thoroughly humiliated. The king said, "Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back; then you may come back."<p>

<bqverse 6>6  When the Ammonites realized that David was disgusted with them,<a name="fnB301" href="2sa_note.htm#fn301"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> they<a name="fnB302" href="2sa_note.htm#fn302"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> sent and hired twenty thousand foot soldiers from Aram Beth Rehob and Aram Zobah,<a name="fnB303" href="2sa_note.htm#fn303"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> in addition to one thousand men from the king of Maacah and twelve thousand men from Ish-tob.<a name="fnB304" href="2sa_note.htm#fn304"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 7>7  When David heard the news, he sent Joab and the entire army to meet them.<a name="fnB305" href="2sa_note.htm#fn305"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  The Ammonites marched out and were deployed for battle at the entrance of the city gate, while the men from Aram Zobah, Rehob, Ish-tob, and Maacah were by themselves in the field.<p>

<bqverse 9>9  When Joab saw that the battle would be fought on two fronts, he chose some of Israel's best men and deployed them against the Arameans.<a name="fnB306" href="2sa_note.htm#fn306"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  He put his brother Abishai in charge of the rest of the army<a name="fnB307" href="2sa_note.htm#fn307"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> and they were deployed<a name="fnB308" href="2sa_note.htm#fn308"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> against the Ammonites. 
<bqverse 11>11  Joab<a name="fnB309" href="2sa_note.htm#fn309"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> said, "If the Arameans start to overpower me,<a name="fnB310" href="2sa_note.htm#fn310"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> you come to my rescue. If the Ammonites start to overpower you,<a name="fnB311" href="2sa_note.htm#fn311"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> I will come to your rescue. 
<bqverse 12>12  Be strong! Let's fight bravely for the sake of our people and the cities of our God! The LORD will do what he decides is best!"<a name="fnB312" href="2sa_note.htm#fn312"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 13>13  So Joab and his men<a name="fnB313" href="2sa_note.htm#fn313"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> marched out to do battle with the Arameans, and they fled before him. 
<bqverse 14>14  When the Ammonites saw the Arameans flee, they fled before his brother Abishai and went into the city. Joab withdrew from fighting the Ammonites and returned to<a name="fnB314" href="2sa_note.htm#fn314"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> Jerusalem.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  When the Arameans realized that they had been defeated by Israel, they consolidated their forces.<a name="fnB315" href="2sa_note.htm#fn315"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  Then Hadadezer sent for Arameans from<a name="fnB316" href="2sa_note.htm#fn316"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> beyond the Euphrates River,<a name="fnB317" href="2sa_note.htm#fn317"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> and they came to Helam. Shobach, the general of Hadadezer's army, led them.<a name="fnB318" href="2sa_note.htm#fn318"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 17>17  When David was informed, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan River,<a name="fnB319" href="2sa_note.htm#fn319"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> and came to Helam. The Arameans deployed their forces against David and fought with him. 
<bqverse 18>18  The Arameans fled before Israel. David killed seven hundred Aramean charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers.<a name="fnB320" href="2sa_note.htm#fn320"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> He also struck down Shobach the general of the army, who died there. 
<bqverse 19>19  When all the kings who were subject to Hadadezer<a name="fnB321" href="2sa_note.htm#fn321"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> saw they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and became subjects of Israel.<a name="fnB322" href="2sa_note.htm#fn322"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> The Arameans were no longer willing to help the Ammonites.

<p><i>David Commits Adultery with Bathsheba</i>
<p><A NAME="11"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> In the spring of the year, at the time when kings<a name="fnB323" href="2sa_note.htm#fn323"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> normally conduct wars,<a name="fnB324" href="2sa_note.htm#fn324"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> David sent out Joab with his soldiers<a name="fnB325" href="2sa_note.htm#fn325"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> and the entire Israelite army.<a name="fnB326" href="2sa_note.htm#fn326"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> They defeated the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed in Jerusalem.<a name="fnB327" href="2sa_note.htm#fn327"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of his palace.<a name="fnB328" href="2sa_note.htm#fn328"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> From the roof he saw a woman bathing. Now this woman was very attractive.<a name="fnB329" href="2sa_note.htm#fn329"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  So David sent someone to inquire about the woman. The messenger<a name="fnB330" href="2sa_note.htm#fn330"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> said, "Isn't this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"<p>

<bqverse 4>4  David sent some messengers to get her.<a name="fnB331" href="2sa_note.htm#fn331"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> She came to him and he had sexual relations with her.<a name="fnB332" href="2sa_note.htm#fn332"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> (Now at that time she was in the process of purifying herself from her menstrual uncleanness.)<a name="fnB333" href="2sa_note.htm#fn333"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> Then she returned to her home. 
<bqverse 5>5  The woman conceived and then sent word to David saying, "I'm pregnant." <p>

<bqverse 6>6  So David sent a message to Joab that said, "Send me Uriah the Hittite." So Joab sent Uriah to David. 
<bqverse 7>7  When Uriah came to him, David asked about how Joab and the army were doing and how the campaign was going.<a name="fnB334" href="2sa_note.htm#fn334"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  Then David said to Uriah, "Go down to your home and relax."<a name="fnB335" href="2sa_note.htm#fn335"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> When Uriah left the palace, the king sent a gift to him.<a name="fnB336" href="2sa_note.htm#fn336"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  But Uriah stayed at the door of the palace with all<a name="fnB337" href="2sa_note.htm#fn337"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> the servants of his lord. He did not go down to his house. <p>

<bqverse 10>10  So they informed David, "Uriah has not gone down to his house." So David said to Uriah, "Haven't you just arrived from a journey? Why haven't you gone down to your house?" 
<bqverse 11>11  Uriah replied to David, "The ark and Israel and Judah reside in huts, and my lord Joab and my lord's soldiers are camping in the field. Should I go to my house to eat and drink and have marital relations<a name="fnB338" href="2sa_note.htm#fn338"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> with my wife? As surely as you are alive,<a name="fnB339" href="2sa_note.htm#fn339"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> I will not do this thing!" 
<bqverse 12>12  So David said to Uriah, "Stay here another day. Tomorrow I will send you back." So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem both that day and the following one.<a name="fnB340" href="2sa_note.htm#fn340"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  Then David summoned him. He ate and drank with him, and got him drunk. But in the evening he went out to sleep on his bed with the servants of his lord; he did not go down to his own house.<p>

<bqverse 14>14  In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah. 
<bqverse 15>15  In the letter he wrote: "Station Uriah in the thick of the battle and then withdraw from him so he will be cut down and killed."<p>

<bqverse 16>16  So as Joab kept watch on the city, he stationed Uriah at the place where he knew the best soldiers were. 
<bqverse 17>17  When the men of the city came out and fought with Joab, some of David's soldiers<a name="fnB341" href="2sa_note.htm#fn341"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> fell in battle. Uriah the Hittite also died.<p>

<bqverse 18>18  Then Joab sent a full battle report to David.<a name="fnB342" href="2sa_note.htm#fn342"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  He instructed the messenger as follows: "When you finish giving the battle report to the king, 
<bqverse 20>20  if the king becomes angry and asks you, `Why did you go so close to the city to fight? Didn't you realize they would shoot from the wall? 
<bqverse 21>21  Who struck down Abimelech the son of Jerub-Besheth? Did a woman not throw an upper millstone<a name="fnB343" href="2sa_note.htm#fn343"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> down on him from the wall so that he died in Thebez? Why did you go so close to the wall?' just say to him, `Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.'"<p>

<bqverse 22>22  So the messenger departed. When he arrived, he informed David of all the news that Joab had sent with him. 
<bqverse 23>23  The messenger said to David, "The men overpowered us and attacked us<a name="fnB344" href="2sa_note.htm#fn344"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> in the field. But we forced them to retreat all the way<a name="fnB345" href="2sa_note.htm#fn345"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> to the door of the city gate. 
<bqverse 24>24  Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall and some of the king's soldiers<a name="fnB346" href="2sa_note.htm#fn346"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> died. Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead." 
<bqverse 25>25  David said to the messenger, "Tell Joab, `Don't let this thing upset you.<a name="fnB347" href="2sa_note.htm#fn347"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> There is no way to anticipate whom the sword will cut down.<a name="fnB348" href="2sa_note.htm#fn348"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> Press the battle against the city and conquer<a name="fnB349" href="2sa_note.htm#fn349"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> it.' Encourage him with these words."<a name="fnB350" href="2sa_note.htm#fn350"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 26>26  When Uriah's wife heard that her husband Uriah was dead, she mourned for him.<a name="fnB351" href="2sa_note.htm#fn351"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  When the time of mourning passed, David had her brought to his palace.<a name="fnB352" href="2sa_note.htm#fn352"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> She became his wife and she bore him a son. But what David had done upset the LORD.<a name="fnB353" href="2sa_note.htm#fn353"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a>

<a name="_Toc494011934"></a></p>
<p><i>Nathan the Prophet Confronts David</i>
<p><A NAME="12"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> So the LORD sent Nathan<a name="fnB354" href="2sa_note.htm#fn354"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> to David. When he came to him, Nathan<a name="fnB355" href="2sa_note.htm#fn355"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> said,<a name="fnB356" href="2sa_note.htm#fn356"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> "There were two men in a certain city, one rich and the other poor. 
<bqverse 2>2  The rich man had a great many flocks and herds. 
<bqverse 3>3  But the poor man had nothing except for a little lamb he had acquired. He raised it, and it grew up alongside him and his children.<a name="fnB357" href="2sa_note.htm#fn357"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> It used to<a name="fnB358" href="2sa_note.htm#fn358"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> eat his food,<a name="fnB359" href="2sa_note.htm#fn359"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> drink from his cup, and sleep in his arms.<a name="fnB360" href="2sa_note.htm#fn360"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> It was just like a daughter to him.<p>

<bqverse 4>4  "When a traveler came to the rich man, he did not want to use one of his own sheep or cattle to feed<a name="fnB361" href="2sa_note.htm#fn361"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the poor man's lamb and fed it to<a name="fnB362" href="2sa_note.htm#fn362"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> the man who had come to him."<p>

<bqverse 5>5  Then David became very angry at this man. He said to Nathan, "As surely the LORD lives, the man who did this deserves to die!<a name="fnB363" href="2sa_note.htm#fn363"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  Because he committed this cold-hearted crime, he must pay for the lamb four times over."<a name="fnB364" href="2sa_note.htm#fn364"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 7>7  Nathan said to David, "You are that man! This is what the LORD God of Israel says: `I chose<a name="fnB365" href="2sa_note.htm#fn365"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> you to be king over Israel and I rescued you from the hand of Saul. 
<bqverse 8>8  I gave you your master's house, and put your master's wives into your arms.<a name="fnB366" href="2sa_note.htm#fn366"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> I also gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if all that somehow seems insignificant, I would have given you so much more as well! 
<bqverse 9>9  Why have you shown contempt for the word of the LORD by doing evil in my<a name="fnB367" href="2sa_note.htm#fn367"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and you have taken his wife as your own.<a name="fnB368" href="2sa_note.htm#fn368"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> You have killed him with the sword of the Ammonites. 
<bqverse 10>10  So now the sword will never depart from your house. For you have despised me by taking the wife of Uriah the Hittite as your own.' 
<bqverse 11>11  This is what the LORD says: `I am about to bring disaster on you<a name="fnB369" href="2sa_note.htm#fn369"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> from inside your own house. Right before your eyes I will take your wives and hand them over to your companion.<a name="fnB370" href="2sa_note.htm#fn370"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> He will have sexual relations with<a name="fnB371" href="2sa_note.htm#fn371"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> your wives in broad daylight.<a name="fnB372" href="2sa_note.htm#fn372"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 12>12  Although you have acted in secret, I will do this thing before all Israel, and in broad daylight.'"<a name="fnB373" href="2sa_note.htm#fn373"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 13>13  Then David exclaimed to Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD!" Nathan replied to David, "Yes, and the LORD has forgiven<a name="fnB374" href="2sa_note.htm#fn374"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> your sin. You are not going to die. 
<bqverse 14>14  Nonetheless, because you have treated the LORD with such contempt<a name="fnB375" href="2sa_note.htm#fn375"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> in this matter, the son who will be born to you will certainly die." <p>

<bqverse 15>15  Then Nathan went to his home. The LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife had borne to David, and the child became very ill.<a name="fnB376" href="2sa_note.htm#fn376"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  Then David prayed to<a name="fnB377" href="2sa_note.htm#fn377"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> God for the child and fasted.<a name="fnB378" href="2sa_note.htm#fn378"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> He would even<a name="fnB379" href="2sa_note.htm#fn379"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> go and spend the night lying on the ground. 
<bqverse 17>17  The elders of his house stood over him and tried to lift him from the ground, but he was unwilling, and refused to eat food with them.<p>

<bqverse 18>18  On the seventh day the child died. But the servants of David were afraid to inform him that the child had died, for they said, "While the child was still alive he would not listen to us<a name="fnB380" href="2sa_note.htm#fn380"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> when we spoke to him. How can we tell him that the child is dead? He will do himself harm!"<a name="fnB381" href="2sa_note.htm#fn381"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 19>19  When David saw that his servants were whispering to one another, he<a name="fnB382" href="2sa_note.htm#fn382"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> realized that the child was dead. So David asked his servants, "Is the child dead?" They replied, "Yes, he's dead." 
<bqverse 20>20  So David got up from the ground, bathed, put on oil, and changed his clothes. He went to the house of the LORD and worshiped. Then, when he entered his palace, he requested that food be brought to him, and he ate. <p>

<bqverse 21>21  His servants said to him, "What is this that you have done? While<a name="fnB383" href="2sa_note.htm#fn383"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> the child was still alive, you fasted and wept. Once the child was dead you got up and ate food!" 
<bqverse 22>22  He replied, "While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept because I thought,<a name="fnB384" href="2sa_note.htm#fn384"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> `Perhaps<a name="fnB385" href="2sa_note.htm#fn385"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD will show pity and the child will live. 
<bqverse 23>23  But now he is dead. Why should I fast? Am I able to bring him back? I will go to him, but he cannot return to me!'" <p>

<bqverse 24>24  So David comforted his wife Bathsheba. He went to her and had marital relations with her.<a name="fnB386" href="2sa_note.htm#fn386"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> She gave birth to a son, and David<a name="fnB387" href="2sa_note.htm#fn387"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> named him Solomon. Now the LORD loved the child<a name="fnB388" href="2sa_note.htm#fn388"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  and sent word through Nathan the prophet that he should be named Jedidiah<a name="fnB389" href="2sa_note.htm#fn389"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> for the LORD's sake.<a name="_Toc494011935"></a></p>
<p><i>David</i>'<i>s Forces Defeat the Ammonites</i>

<bqverse 27>27  Then Joab sent messengers to David saying, "I have fought in Rabbah and have captured the water supply of the city.<a name="fnB391" href="2sa_note.htm#fn391"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 29>29  So David assembled all the army and went to Rabbah and fought against it and captured it. 
<bqverse 30>30  He took the crown of their king<a name="fnB393" href="2sa_note.htm#fn393"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> from his head--it was gold, weighed about seventy-five pounds,<a name="fnB394" href="2sa_note.htm#fn394"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> and held a precious stone--and it was placed on David's head.

<bqverse 31>31  He removed<a name="fnB395" href="2sa_note.htm#fn395"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> the people who were in it and made them do hard labor with saws, iron picks, and iron axes, putting them to work at the brick kiln. This was his policy<a name="fnB396" href="2sa_note.htm#fn396"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> with all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all the army returned to Jerusalem.

<p><i>The Rape of Tamar</i>
<p><A NAME="13"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Now David's son Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar. In the course of time David's son Amnon fell in love with her.<a name="fnB397" href="2sa_note.htm#fn397"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  But Amnon became frustrated because he was so lovesick<a name="fnB398" href="2sa_note.htm#fn398"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> over his sister Tamar. For she was a virgin, and to Amnon it seemed out of the question to do anything to her. <p>

<bqverse 3>3  Now Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, the son of David's brother Shimeah. Jonadab was a very crafty man. 
<bqverse 4>4  He asked Amnon,<a name="fnB399" href="2sa_note.htm#fn399"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> "Why are you, the king's son,<a name="fnB400" href="2sa_note.htm#fn400"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> so depressed every morning? Can't you tell me?" So Amnon said to him, "I'm in love with Tamar the sister of my brother Absalom." 
<bqverse 5>5  Jonadab replied to him, "Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick.<a name="fnB401" href="2sa_note.htm#fn401"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> When your father comes in to see you, say to him, `Please let my sister Tamar come in so she can fix some food for me. Let her prepare the food in my sight so I can watch. Then I will eat from her hand.'"<p>

<bqverse 6>6  So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. When the king came in to see him, Amnon said to the king, "Please let my sister Tamar come in so she can make a couple of cakes in my sight. Then I will eat from her hand."<p>

<bqverse 7>7  So David sent to Tamar to the house saying, "Please go to the house of Amnon your brother and prepare some food for him." 
<bqverse 8>8  So Tamar went to the house of Amnon her brother, who was lying down. She took the dough, kneaded it, made some cakes while he watched,<a name="fnB402" href="2sa_note.htm#fn402"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> and baked them.<a name="fnB403" href="2sa_note.htm#fn403"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  But when she took the pan and set it before him, he refused to eat. Instead Amnon said, "Get everyone out of here!"<a name="fnB404" href="2sa_note.htm#fn404"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> So everyone left.<a name="fnB405" href="2sa_note.htm#fn405"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 10>10  Then Amnon said to Tamar, "Bring the cakes into the bedroom; then I will eat from your hand." So Tamar took the cakes that she had prepared and brought them to her brother Amnon in the bedroom. 
<bqverse 11>11  As she brought them to him to eat, he grabbed her and said to her, "Come on! Get in bed with me, my sister!" <p>

<bqverse 12>12  But she said to him, "No, my brother! Don't humiliate me! This just isn't done in Israel! Don't do this foolish thing! 
<bqverse 13>13  How could I ever be rid of my humiliation? And you would be considered one of the fools<a name="fnB406" href="2sa_note.htm#fn406"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> in Israel! Just<a name="fnB407" href="2sa_note.htm#fn407"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you." 
<bqverse 14>14  But he refused to listen to her.<a name="fnB408" href="2sa_note.htm#fn408"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> He overpowered her and humiliated her by raping her.<a name="fnB409" href="2sa_note.htm#fn409"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  Then Amnon greatly despised her.<a name="fnB410" href="2sa_note.htm#fn410"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> His disdain toward her surpassed the love he had previously felt toward her.<a name="fnB411" href="2sa_note.htm#fn411"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> Amnon said to her, "Get up and leave!"<p>

<bqverse 16>16  But she said to him, "No I won't, for sending me away now would be worse than what you did to me earlier!" <a name="fnB412" href="2sa_note.htm#fn412"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> But he refused to listen to her. 
<bqverse 17>17  He called his personal attendant and said to him, "Take this woman out my sight<a name="fnB413" href="2sa_note.htm#fn413"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> and lock the door behind her!" 
<bqverse 18>18  (Now she was wearing a long robe,<a name="fnB414" href="2sa_note.htm#fn414"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> for this is what the king's virgin daughters used to wear.) So Amnon's<a name="fnB415" href="2sa_note.htm#fn415"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> attendant removed her and bolted the door<a name="fnB416" href="2sa_note.htm#fn416"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> behind her. 
<bqverse 19>19  Then Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the long robe she was wearing. She put her hands on her head and went on her way, wailing as she went.<p>

<bqverse 20>20  Her brother Absalom said to her, "Was Amnon your brother with you? Now be quiet, my sister. He is your brother. Don't take it so seriously!"<a name="fnB417" href="2sa_note.htm#fn417"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> Tamar, devastated, lived in the house of her brother Absalom. <p>

<bqverse 21>21  Now king David heard about all these things and was very angry.<a name="fnB418" href="2sa_note.htm#fn418"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  But Absalom said nothing to Amnon, either bad or good, for Absalom hated Amnon because he had humiliated his sister Tamar. <a name="_Toc494011937"></a></p>
<p><i>Absalom Has Amnon Put to Death</i>
<p>
<bqverse 23>23  Two years later Absalom's sheepshearers were in Baal Hazor, near Ephraim. Absalom summoned all the king's sons. 
<bqverse 24>24  Then Absalom went to the king and said, "My<a name="fnB419" href="2sa_note.htm#fn419"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> shearers are here. Let the king and his servants go with me."<p>

<bqverse 25>25  But the king said to Absalom, "No, my son. We shouldn't all go. We shouldn't burden you in that way." Though Absalom<a name="fnB420" href="2sa_note.htm#fn420"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> pressed<a name="fnB421" href="2sa_note.htm#fn421"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> him, he was not willing to go. Instead, David<a name="fnB422" href="2sa_note.htm#fn422"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> blessed him. <p>

<bqverse 26>26  Then Absalom said, "If you will not go,<a name="fnB423" href="2sa_note.htm#fn423"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> then let my brother Amnon go with us." The king replied to him, "Why should he go with you?" 
<bqverse 27>27  But when Absalom pressed him, he sent Amnon and all the king's sons along with him. <p>

<bqverse 28>28  Absalom instructed his servants, "Look! When Amnon is drunk<a name="fnB424" href="2sa_note.htm#fn424"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> and I say to you, `Strike Amnon,' kill him then and there. Don't fear! Is it not I who have given you these instructions? Be strong and courageous!<a name="fnB425" href="2sa_note.htm#fn425"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 29>29  So Absalom's servants did to Amnon exactly what Absalom had instructed. Then all the king's sons got up; each one rode away on his mule and fled.<p>

<bqverse 30>30  While they were still on their way, the following report reached David: "Absalom has killed all the king's sons; not one of them is left!" 
<bqverse 31>31  Then the king stood up and tore his garments and lay down on the ground. All his servants were standing there with torn garments as well.<p>

<bqverse 32>32  Jonadab, the son of David's brother Shimeah, said, "My lord should not say, `They have killed all the young men who are the king's sons.' For only Amnon is dead. This is what Absalom has talked about<a name="fnB426" href="2sa_note.htm#fn426"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> from the day that Amnon<a name="fnB427" href="2sa_note.htm#fn427"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> humiliated his sister Tamar. 
<bqverse 33>33  Now don't let my lord the king be concerned about the report that has come saying, `All the king's sons are dead.' It is only Amnon who is dead." <p>

<bqverse 34>34  In the meantime Absalom fled. When the servant who was the watchman looked up, he saw many people coming from the west<a name="fnB428" href="2sa_note.htm#fn428"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> on a road beside the hill. 
<bqverse 35>35  Jonadab said to the king, "Look! The king's sons have come! It's just like I said!"<p>

<bqverse 36>36  As he finished speaking, the king's sons arrived, wailing and weeping.<a name="fnB429" href="2sa_note.htm#fn429"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> The king and all his servants wept loudly<a name="fnB430" href="2sa_note.htm#fn430"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> as well. 
<bqverse 37>37  But Absalom fled and went to King Talmai son of Ammihud of Geshur. David<a name="fnB431" href="2sa_note.htm#fn431"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> grieved over his son every day.<p>

<bqverse 38>38  After Absalom fled and went to Geshur, he remained there for three years. 
<bqverse 39>39  The king longed<a name="fnB432" href="2sa_note.htm#fn432"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> to go to Absalom, for he had since been consoled over the death of Amnon.<a name="fnB433" href="2sa_note.htm#fn433"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqchapter 14>
<a name="_Toc494011938"></a></p>
<p><i>David Permits Absalom to Return to Jerusalem</i>
<p><A NAME="14"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>Now Joab son of Zeruiah realized that the king longed to see<a name="fnB434" href="2sa_note.htm#fn434"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> Absalom. 
<bqverse 2>2  So Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman. He told her, "Pretend to be in mourning<a name="fnB435" href="2sa_note.htm#fn435"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> and put on garments for mourning. Don't anoint yourself with oil. Instead, act like a woman who has been mourning for the dead for some time.<a name="fnB436" href="2sa_note.htm#fn436"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  Go to the king and speak to him in the following fashion." Then Joab told her what to say.<a name="fnB437" href="2sa_note.htm#fn437"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 4>4  So the Tekoan woman went<a name="fnB438" href="2sa_note.htm#fn438"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> to the king. She bowed down with her face to the ground in deference to him and said, "Please help me,<a name="fnB439" href="2sa_note.htm#fn439"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> O king!" 
<bqverse 5>5  The king replied to her, "What do you want?"<a name="fnB440" href="2sa_note.htm#fn440"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> She answered, "I am a widow; my husband is dead. 
<bqverse 6>6 Your servant<a name="fnB441" href="2sa_note.htm#fn441"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> has two sons. When the two of them got into a fight in the field, there was no one present who could intervene. One of them struck the other and killed him. 
<bqverse 7>7  Now the entire family has risen up against your servant, saying, `Turn over the one who struck down his brother, so that we can put him to death and avenge the death<a name="fnB442" href="2sa_note.htm#fn442"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> of his brother whom he killed. In so doing we will also destroy the heir.' They want to extinguish my remaining coal,<a name="fnB443" href="2sa_note.htm#fn443"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> leaving no one on the face of the earth to carry on the name of my husband." <p>

<bqverse 8>8  Then the king told the woman, "Go to your home. I will give instructions concerning your situation."<a name="fnB444" href="2sa_note.htm#fn444"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  The Tekoan woman said to the king, "My lord the king, let any blame fall on me and on the house of my father. But let the king and his throne be innocent!" <p>

<bqverse 10>10  The king said, "Bring to me whoever speaks to you, and he won't bother you again!" 
<bqverse 11>11  She replied, "In that case,<a name="fnB445" href="2sa_note.htm#fn445"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> let the king invoke the name of<a name="fnB446" href="2sa_note.htm#fn446"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD your God so that the avenger of blood may not kill! Then they will not destroy my son!" He replied, "As surely as the LORD lives, not a single hair of your son's head<a name="fnB447" href="2sa_note.htm#fn447"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> will fall to the ground."<p>

<bqverse 12>12  Then the woman said, "Please permit your servant to speak to my lord the king about another matter." He replied, "Tell me." 
<bqverse 13>13  The woman said, "Why have you devised something like this against God's people? When the king speaks in this fashion, he makes himself guilty, for the king has not brought back the one he has banished. 
<bqverse 14>14  Certainly we must die, and are like water spilled on the ground that cannot be gathered up again. But God does not take away life; instead he devises ways for the banished to be restored.<a name="fnB448" href="2sa_note.htm#fn448"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  I have now come to speak with my lord the king about this matter, because the people have made me fearful.<a name="fnB449" href="2sa_note.htm#fn449"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> But your servant said, `I will speak to the king! Perhaps the king will do what his female servant<a name="fnB450" href="2sa_note.htm#fn450"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> asks. 
<bqverse 16>16  Yes!<a name="fnB451" href="2sa_note.htm#fn451"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> The king may<a name="fnB452" href="2sa_note.htm#fn452"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a>listen and deliver his female servant<a name="fnB453" href="2sa_note.htm#fn453"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> from the hand of the man who seeks to remove<a name="fnB454" href="2sa_note.htm#fn454"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> both me and my son from the inheritance God has given us!'<a name="fnB455" href="2sa_note.htm#fn455"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  So your servant said, `May the word of my lord the king be my security, for my lord the king is like the angel of God when it comes to deciding between right and wrong! May the LORD your God be with you!'"<p>

<bqverse 18>18  Then the king replied to the woman, "Don't hide any information from me when I question you." The woman said, "Let my lord the king speak!" 
<bqverse 19>19  The king said, "Did Joab put you up to all of this?" <a name="fnB456" href="2sa_note.htm#fn456"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> The woman answered, "As surely as you live, my lord the king, there is no deviation to the right or to the left from all that my lord the king has said. For your servant Joab gave me instructions. He has put all these words in your servant's mouth. 
<bqverse 20>20  Your servant Joab did this so as to change this situation. But my lord has wisdom like that of the angel of God, and knows everything that is happening in the land."<a name="fnB457" href="2sa_note.htm#fn457"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 21>21 Then the king said to Joab, "All right! I<a name="fnB458" href="2sa_note.htm#fn458"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> will do this thing! Go and bring back the young man Absalom! 
<bqverse 22>22  Then Joab bowed down with his face toward the ground and thanked<a name="fnB459" href="2sa_note.htm#fn459"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> the king. Joab said, "Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord the king, because the king has granted the request of your<a name="fnB460" href="2sa_note.htm#fn460"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> servant!"<p>

<bqverse 23>23  So Joab got up and went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 24>24  But the king said, "Let him go over<a name="fnB461" href="2sa_note.htm#fn461"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> to his own house. He may not see my face." So Absalom went over<a name="fnB462" href="2sa_note.htm#fn462"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> to his own house; he did not see the king's face.<p>

<bqverse 25>25  Now in all Israel everyone acknowledged that there was no man as handsome as Absalom.<a name="fnB463" href="2sa_note.htm#fn463"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> From the sole of his feet to the top of his head he was perfect in appearance.<a name="fnB464" href="2sa_note.htm#fn464"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  When he would shave his head--at the end of every year he used to shave his head, for it grew too long<a name="fnB465" href="2sa_note.htm#fn465"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> and he would shave it--he used to weigh the hair of his head at three pounds<a name="fnB466" href="2sa_note.htm#fn466"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> according to the king's weight. 
<bqverse 27>27  Absalom had<a name="fnB467" href="2sa_note.htm#fn467"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> three sons and one daughter, whose name was Tamar. She was a very attractive woman.<a name="fnB468" href="2sa_note.htm#fn468"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 28>28  Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years without seeing the king's face. 
<bqverse 29>29  Then Absalom sent a message to Joab asking him to send him to the king, but Joab was not willing to come to him. So he sent a second message to him, but he still was not willing to come. 
<bqverse 30>30  So he said to his servants, "Look, Joab has a portion of field adjacent to mine and he has some barley there. Go and set it on fire."<a name="fnB469" href="2sa_note.htm#fn469"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> So Absalom's servants set Joab's<a name="fnB470" href="2sa_note.htm#fn470"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> portion of the field on fire.<p>

<bqverse 31>31  Then Joab got up and came to Absalom's house. He said to him, "Why did your servants set my portion of field on fire?" 
<bqverse 32>32  Absalom said to Joab, "Look, I sent a message to you saying, `Come so that I can send you to the king with this message,<a name="fnB471" href="2sa_note.htm#fn471"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> "Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me if I were still there."' Let me now see the face of the king. If I am at fault, let him put me to death!" <p>

<bqverse 33>33  So Joab went to the king and informed him. The king<a name="fnB472" href="2sa_note.htm#fn472"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> summoned Absalom, and he came to the king. Absalom<a name="fnB473" href="2sa_note.htm#fn473"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> bowed down before the king with his face toward the ground and the king kissed him.<a name="fnB474" href="2sa_note.htm#fn474"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 2>2  Now Absalom used to get up early and stand beside the road that led to the city gate. Whenever anyone came by who had a complaint to bring to the king for arbitration, Absalom would call out to him, "What city are you from?" He would answer, "I<a name="fnB477" href="2sa_note.htm#fn477"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> am from one of the tribes of Israel." 
<bqverse 3>3  Absalom would then say to him, "Look, your claims are legitimate and appropriate.<a name="fnB478" href="2sa_note.htm#fn478"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> But there is no representative of the king who will listen to you." 
<bqverse 4>4 Absalom would then say, "If only they would make me<a name="fnB479" href="2sa_note.htm#fn479"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> a judge in the land! Then everyone who had a judicial complaint<a name="fnB480" href="2sa_note.htm#fn480"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> could come to me and I would make sure he receives a just settlement." <p>

<bqverse 5>5  When someone approached to bow before him, Absalom<a name="fnB481" href="2sa_note.htm#fn481"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> would extend his hand and embrace him and kiss him. 
<bqverse 6>6  Absalom acted this way toward everyone in Israel who would come to the king for justice. In this way Absalom won the loyalty<a name="fnB482" href="2sa_note.htm#fn482"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> of the citizens<a name="fnB483" href="2sa_note.htm#fn483"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> of Israel. <p>

<bqverse 7>7  After four<a name="fnB484" href="2sa_note.htm#fn484"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> years Absalom said to the king, "Let me go and repay my vow that I made to the LORD while I was in Hebron. 
<bqverse 8>8  For I made this vow<a name="fnB485" href="2sa_note.htm#fn485"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> when I was living in Geshur in Aram: `If the LORD really does allow me to return to Jerusalem, I will serve the LORD.'" 
<bqverse 9>9  The king replied to him, "Go in peace." So he got up and went to Hebron. <p>

<bqverse 10>10  Then Absalom sent spies through all the tribes of Israel who said, "When you hear the sound of the horn, you may assume<a name="fnB486" href="2sa_note.htm#fn486"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> that Absalom rules in Hebron." 
<bqverse 11>11  Now two hundred men had gone with Absalom from Jerusalem. Since they were invited, they went naively and were unaware of what Absalom was planning.<a name="fnB487" href="2sa_note.htm#fn487"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  While he was offering sacrifices, Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's advisor,<a name="fnB488" href="2sa_note.htm#fn488"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> to come from his city, Giloh.<a name="fnB489" href="2sa_note.htm#fn489"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> The conspiracy was gaining momentum, and the people were starting to side with Absalom.<a name="_Toc494011940"></a></p>
<p><i>David Flees from Jerusalem</i>
<p>
<bqverse 13>13  Then a messenger came to David and reported, "The men of Israel are loyal to Absalom!" <a name="fnB490" href="2sa_note.htm#fn490"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 14>14  So David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem, "Come on!<a name="fnB491" href="2sa_note.htm#fn491"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> Let's escape!<a name="fnB492" href="2sa_note.htm#fn492"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> Otherwise no one will be delivered from Absalom! Go immediately, or else he will quickly overtake us and bring<a name="fnB493" href="2sa_note.htm#fn493"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> disaster on us and kill the city's residents with the sword." <a name="fnB494" href="2sa_note.htm#fn494"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 15>15  The king's servants replied to the king, "We will do whatever our lord the king decides."<a name="fnB495" href="2sa_note.htm#fn495"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 16>16  So the king and all the members of his royal court<a name="fnB496" href="2sa_note.htm#fn496"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> set out on foot, though the king left behind ten concubines<a name="fnB497" href="2sa_note.htm#fn497"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> to attend to the palace. 
<bqverse 17>17  The king and all the people set out on foot, pausing<a name="fnB498" href="2sa_note.htm#fn498"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> at a spot<a name="fnB499" href="2sa_note.htm#fn499"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> some distance away. 
<bqverse 18>18  All his servants were leaving with him,<a name="fnB500" href="2sa_note.htm#fn500"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> along with all the Kerethites, all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites--some six hundred men who had come on foot from Gath. They were leaving with<a name="fnB501" href="2sa_note.htm#fn501"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> the king.<p>

<bqverse 19>19  Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why should you come with us? Go back and stay with the new<a name="fnB502" href="2sa_note.htm#fn502"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> king, for you are a foreigner and an exile from your own country.<a name="fnB503" href="2sa_note.htm#fn503"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  It seems like you arrived just yesterday. Today should I make you wander around by going with us? I go where I must go. But as for you, go back and take your men<a name="fnB504" href="2sa_note.htm#fn504"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> with you. May genuine loyal love<a name="fnB505" href="2sa_note.htm#fn505"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> protect<a name="fnB506" href="2sa_note.htm#fn506"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> you!" <p>

<bqverse 21>21  But Ittai replied to the king, "As surely as the LORD lives and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king is, whether dead or alive,<a name="fnB507" href="2sa_note.htm#fn507"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> there I<a name="fnB508" href="2sa_note.htm#fn508"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> will be as well!" 
<bqverse 22>22  So David said to Ittai, "Come along then."<a name="fnB509" href="2sa_note.htm#fn509"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> So Ittai the Gittite went along,<a name="fnB510" href="2sa_note.htm#fn510"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> accompanied by all his men and all the dependents<a name="fnB511" href="2sa_note.htm#fn511"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> who were with him.<p>

<bqverse 23>23  All the land was weeping loudly<a name="fnB512" href="2sa_note.htm#fn512"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> as all these people were leaving.<a name="fnB513" href="2sa_note.htm#fn513"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> As the king was crossing over the Kidron Valley, all the people were leaving<a name="fnB514" href="2sa_note.htm#fn514"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> on the road that leads to the desert. 
<bqverse 24>24  Zadok and all the Levites who were with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. When they positioned the ark of God, Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had finished leaving<a name="fnB515" href="2sa_note.htm#fn515"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> the city. <p>

<bqverse 25>25  Then the king said to Zadok, "Take the ark of God back to the city. If I find favor in the LORD's sight he will bring me back and enable me to see both it and his dwelling place again. 
<bqverse 26>26  However, if he should say, `I do not take pleasure in you,' then he will deal with me in a way that he considers appropriate."<a name="fnB516" href="2sa_note.htm#fn516"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 27>27  The king said to Zadok the priest, "Are you a seer?<a name="fnB517" href="2sa_note.htm#fn517"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> Go back to the city in peace! Your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan may go with you and Abiathar.<a name="fnB518" href="2sa_note.htm#fn518"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  Look, I will be waiting at the fords of the desert until word from you<a name="fnB519" href="2sa_note.htm#fn519"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> reaches me." 
<bqverse 29>29  So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem and remained there.<p>

<bqverse 30>30  As David was going up the Mount of Olives, he was weeping as he went; his head was covered and his feet bare. All the people who were with him also had their heads covered and were weeping as they went up. 
<bqverse 31>31  Now David<a name="fnB520" href="2sa_note.htm#fn520"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> had been told, "Ahithophel has sided with the conspirators who are with Absalom. So David prayed,<a name="fnB521" href="2sa_note.htm#fn521"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> "Make the advice of Ahithophel foolish, O LORD!" <p>

<bqverse 32>32  When David came to the summit, where he used to worship God, Hushai the Arkite met him with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. 
<bqverse 33>33  David said to him, "If you leave<a name="fnB522" href="2sa_note.htm#fn522"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> with me you will be a burden to me. 
<bqverse 34>34  But you will be able to counter the advice of Ahithophel if you go back to the city and say to Absalom, `I will be your servant, O king! Previously I was your father's servant, and now I will be your servant.' 
<bqverse 35>35  Zadok and Abiathar the priests will be there with you.<a name="fnB523" href="2sa_note.htm#fn523"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> Everything you hear in the king's palace<a name="fnB524" href="2sa_note.htm#fn524"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> you must tell Zadok and Abiathar the priests. 
<bqverse 36>36  Furthermore, their two sons are there with them, Zadok's son Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan. You must send them to me with any information you hear."<a name="fnB525" href="2sa_note.htm#fn525"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 37>37  So David's friend Hushai arrived in the city, just as Absalom was entering Jerusalem.

<p><i>David Receives Gifts from Ziba</i>
<p><A NAME="16"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>When David had gone a short way beyond the summit, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth was there to meet him. He had a couple of donkeys that were saddled, and on them were two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred raisin cakes, a hundred baskets of summer fruit,<a name="fnB526" href="2sa_note.htm#fn526"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> and a container of wine. <p>

<bqverse 2>2  The king asked Ziba, "Why did you bring these things?"<a name="fnB527" href="2sa_note.htm#fn527"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> Ziba replied, "The donkeys are for the king's family to ride on, the loaves of bread<a name="fnB528" href="2sa_note.htm#fn528"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> and the summer fruit are for the attendants,<a name="fnB529" href="2sa_note.htm#fn529"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> and the wine is for those who get exhausted in the desert."<a name="fnB530" href="2sa_note.htm#fn530"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  The king asked, "Where is your master's grandson?"<a name="fnB531" href="2sa_note.htm#fn531"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> Ziba replied to the king, "He remains in Jerusalem, for he said, `Today the house of Israel will give back to me my grandfather's<a name="fnB532" href="2sa_note.htm#fn532"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> kingdom.'" 
<bqverse 4>4  The king said to Ziba, "Everything that was Mephibosheth's now belongs to you." Ziba replied, "I bow before you. May I find favor in your sight, my lord the king." <a name="_Toc494011942"></a></p>
<p><i>Shimei Curses David and His Men</i>
<p>
<bqverse 5>5  Then king David came<a name="fnB533" href="2sa_note.htm#fn533"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> to Bahurim. There a man from Saul's extended family named Shimei son of Gera came out, yelling curses as he approached.<a name="fnB534" href="2sa_note.htm#fn534"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  He threw stones at David and all of king David's servants, as well as all the people and the soldiers who were on his right and on his left. 
<bqverse 7>7  As he yelled curses, Shimei said, "Leave! Leave! You man of bloodshed, you wicked man!<a name="fnB535" href="2sa_note.htm#fn535"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  The LORD has punished you for<a name="fnB536" href="2sa_note.htm#fn536"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> all the spilled blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you rule. Now the LORD has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. Disaster has overtaken you, for you are a man of bloodshed!" <p>

<bqverse 9>9  Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head!" 
<bqverse 10>10  But the king said, "What do we have in common,<a name="fnB537" href="2sa_note.htm#fn537"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> you sons of Zeruiah? If he curses because the LORD has said to him, `Curse David!', who can say to him, `Why have you done this?'"
<bqverse 11>11  Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, "My very son, who came from my own body, is trying to take my life. So also now this Benjaminite! Leave him alone so that he can curse, for the LORD has spoken to him. 
<bqverse 12>12  Perhaps the LORD will notice my affliction<a name="fnB538" href="2sa_note.htm#fn538"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> and this day grant me good in place of his curse."<a name="fnB539" href="2sa_note.htm#fn539"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 13>13  So David and his men went on their way. But Shimei kept going along the side of the hill opposite him, yelling curses as he threw stones and dirt at them.<a name="fnB540" href="2sa_note.htm#fn540"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  The king and all the people who were with him arrived exhausted at their destination, where David<a name="fnB541" href="2sa_note.htm#fn541"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> refreshed himself. <a name="_Toc494011943"></a></p>
<p><i>The Advice of Ahithophel</i>
<p>
<bqverse 15>15  Now when Absalom and all the men<a name="fnB542" href="2sa_note.htm#fn542"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> of Israel arrived in Jerusalem, Ahithophel was with him. 
<bqverse 16>16  When David's friend Hushai the Arkite came to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, "Long live the king! Long live the king!" <p>

<bqverse 17>17  Absalom said to Hushai, "Do you call this loyalty to your friend? Why didn't you go with your friend?" 
<bqverse 18>18  Hushai replied to Absalom, "No, I will be loyal to the one whom the LORD, these people, and all the men of Israel have chosen.<a name="fnB543" href="2sa_note.htm#fn543"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  Moreover, whom should I serve? Should it not be his son? Just as I served your father, so I will serve you."<a name="fnB544" href="2sa_note.htm#fn544"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 20>20  Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give us your advice. What should we do?" 
<bqverse 21>21  Ahithophel replied to Absalom, "Have sex with<a name="fnB545" href="2sa_note.htm#fn545"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> your father's concubines whom he left to care for the palace. All Israel will hear that you have made yourself repulsive to your father. Then your followers will be motivated."<a name="fnB546" href="2sa_note.htm#fn546"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a><i> </i>
<bqverse 22>22  So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and Absalom had sex with<a name="fnB547" href="2sa_note.htm#fn547"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel. <p>

<bqverse 23>23  In those days Ahithophel's advice was considered as valuable as a prophetic revelation.<a name="fnB548" href="2sa_note.htm#fn548"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> Both David and Absalom highly regarded the advice of Ahitophel.<a name="fnB549" href="2sa_note.htm#fn549"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqchapter 17>
<a name="_Toc494011944"></a></p>
<p><i>The Death of Ahithophel</i>
<p><A NAME="17"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Let me pick out twelve thousand men. Then I will go and pursue David this very night. 
<bqverse 2>2  When I catch up to<a name="fnB550" href="2sa_note.htm#fn550"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> him he will be exhausted and worn out.<a name="fnB551" href="2sa_note.htm#fn551"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> I will rout him, and the entire army that is with him will flee. I will kill only the king 
<bqverse 3>3  and will bring the entire army back to you. In exchange for the life of the man you are seeking, you will get back everyone.<a name="fnB552" href="2sa_note.htm#fn552"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> The entire army will return unharmed."<a name="fnB553" href="2sa_note.htm#fn553"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 4>4  This seemed like a good idea to Absalom and to all the leaders<a name="fnB554" href="2sa_note.htm#fn554"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> of Israel. 
<bqverse 5>5  But Absalom said, "Call for<a name="fnB555" href="2sa_note.htm#fn555"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> Hushai the Arkite, and let's hear what he has to say."<a name="fnB556" href="2sa_note.htm#fn556"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  So Hushai came to Absalom. Absalom said to him, "Here is what Ahithophel has advised. Should we follow his advice? If not, what would you recommend?"<p>

<bqverse 7>7  Hushai replied to Absalom, "Ahithophel's advice is not sound this time."<a name="fnB557" href="2sa_note.htm#fn557"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  Hushai went on to say, "You know your father and his men--they are soldiers and are as dangerous as a bear out in the wild that has been robbed of her cubs.<a name="fnB558" href="2sa_note.htm#fn558"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> Your father is an experienced soldier; he will not stay overnight with the army. 
<bqverse 9>9  At this very moment he is hiding out in one of the caves or in some other similar place. If it should turn out that he attacks our troops first,<a name="fnB559" href="2sa_note.htm#fn559"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> whoever hears about it will say, `Absalom's army has been slaughtered!' 
<bqverse 10>10  If that happens even the bravest soldier--one who is lion-hearted--will virtually melt away. For all Israel knows that your father is a warrior and that those who are with him are brave. 
<bqverse 11>11  My advice therefore is this: Let all Israel from Dan to Beersheba--in number like the sand by the sea!--be gathered to you, and you lead them personally into battle. 
<bqverse 12>12  We will come against him wherever he happens to be found. We will descend on him like the dew falls on the ground. Neither he nor any of the men who are with him will be spared alive--not one of them! 
<bqverse 13>13  If he regroups in a city, all Israel will take up ropes to that city and drag it down to the valley, so that not a single pebble will be left there!"<p>

<bqverse 14>14  Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, "The advice of Hushai the Arkite sounds better than the advice of Ahithophel." Now the LORD had decided<a name="fnB560" href="2sa_note.htm#fn560"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> to frustrate the sound advice of Ahithophel, so that the LORD could bring disaster on Absalom. <p>

<bqverse 15>15  Then Hushai reported to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, "Here is what Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the leaders<a name="fnB561" href="2sa_note.htm#fn561"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> of Israel, and here is what I have advised. 
<bqverse 16>16  Now send word quickly to David and advise him, "Don't spend the night at the fords of the desert tonight. Instead, be sure you cross over, or else the king and everyone who is with him may be overwhelmed."<a name="fnB562" href="2sa_note.htm#fn562"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 17>17  Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying in En Rogel. A female servant would go and inform them, and they would then go and inform king David. It was not advisable for them to be seen going into the city. 
<bqverse 18>18  But a young man saw them on one occasion and informed Absalom. So the two of them quickly departed and went to the house of a man in Bahurim. There was a well in his courtyard, and they got down in it. 
<bqverse 19>19  His wife then took the covering and spread it over the top of the well and scattered some grain over it. No one was aware of what she had done. <p>

<bqverse 20>20  When the servants of Absalom approached the woman at her home, they asked, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" The woman replied to them, "They crossed over the stream." Absalom's men<a name="fnB563" href="2sa_note.htm#fn563"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> searched but did not find them, so they returned to Jerusalem.<p>

<bqverse 21>21  After the men had left, Ahimaaz and Jonathan<a name="fnB564" href="2sa_note.htm#fn564"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> climbed out of the well. Then they left and informed King David. They advised David, "Get up and cross the stream<a name="fnB565" href="2sa_note.htm#fn565"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> quickly, for Ahithophel has devised a plan to catch you."<a name="fnB566" href="2sa_note.htm#fn566"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  So David and all the people who were with him got up and crossed the Jordan River.<a name="fnB567" href="2sa_note.htm#fn567"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> By dawn there was not one left who had not crossed the Jordan.<p>

<bqverse 23>23  When Ahithophel realized that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and returned to his house in his hometown. After setting his household in order, he hanged himself. So he died and was buried in the grave<a name="fnB568" href="2sa_note.htm#fn568"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> of his father.<p>

<bqverse 24>24  Meanwhile David had gone to Mahanaim, while Absalom and all the men of Israel had crossed the Jordan River. 
<bqverse 25>25  Absalom had made Amasa general of the army in place of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of an Israelite man named Jether, who had married<a name="fnB569" href="2sa_note.htm#fn569"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> Abigail the daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother. 
<bqverse 26>26  The army of Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead. <p>

<bqverse 27>27  When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, Makir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim 
<bqverse 28>28  brought bedding, basins, and pottery utensils. They also brought food for David and all who were with him, including wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils,<a name="fnB570" href="2sa_note.htm#fn570"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 29>29  honey, curds, flocks, and cheese.<a name="fnB571" href="2sa_note.htm#fn571"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> For they said, "The people are no doubt hungry, tired, and thirsty there in the desert."
<bqchapter 18>

<p><i>The Death of Absalom</i>
<p><A NAME="18"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> David assembled the army that was with him. He appointed leaders of thousands and leaders of hundreds. 
<bqverse 2>2  David then sent out the army--a third under the leadership of Joab, a third under the leadership of Joab's brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under the leadership of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the army, "I too will indeed march out with you."<p>

<bqverse 3>3  But the army said, "You should not do this.<a name="fnB572" href="2sa_note.htm#fn572"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> For if we should have to make a rapid retreat, they won't be too concerned about us.<a name="fnB573" href="2sa_note.htm#fn573"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> Even if half of us should die, they won't be too concerned about us. But you<a name="fnB574" href="2sa_note.htm#fn574"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> are like ten thousand of us! So it is better if you remain in the city for support." 
<bqverse 4>4  Then the king said to them, "I will do whatever seems best to you."<p>
So the king stayed beside the gate, while all the army marched out by hundreds and by thousands. 
<bqverse 5>5  The king gave this order to Joab, Abishai, and Ittai: "For my sake deal gently with the young man Absalom." Now the entire army was listening when the king gave all the leaders this order concerning Absalom.<p>

<bqverse 6>6  Then the army marched out to the field to fight against Israel. The battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.
<bqverse 7>7  The army of Israel was defeated there by David's men.<a name="fnB575" href="2sa_note.htm#fn575"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> The slaughter there was great that day--twenty thousand soldiers were killed. 
<bqverse 8>8  The battle there was spread out over that whole area, and the forest consumed more soldiers than the sword devoured that day.<p>

<bqverse 9>9  Then Absalom happened to come across David's men. Now as Absalom was riding on his<a name="fnB576" href="2sa_note.htm#fn576"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> mule, it<a name="fnB577" href="2sa_note.htm#fn577"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> went under the branches of a large oak tree. His head was caught in the oak and he was suspended in midair,<a name="fnB578" href="2sa_note.htm#fn578"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> while the mule he had been riding kept going.<p>

<bqverse 10>10  When one<a name="fnB579" href="2sa_note.htm#fn579"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> of the men saw this, he reported it to Joab saying, "I saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree.
<bqverse 11>11  Joab replied to the man who was relating this to him, "What! You saw this? Why didn't you strike him down right on the spot?<a name="fnB580" href="2sa_note.htm#fn580"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> I would have given you ten pieces of silver<a name="fnB581" href="2sa_note.htm#fn581"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and a commemorative belt!"<p>

<bqverse 12>12  The man replied to Joab, "Even if<a name="fnB582" href="2sa_note.htm#fn582"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> I were receiving<a name="fnB583" href="2sa_note.htm#fn583"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> a thousand pieces of silver,<a name="fnB584" href="2sa_note.htm#fn584"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> I would not strike<a name="fnB585" href="2sa_note.htm#fn585"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> the king's son! In our very presence<a name="fnB586" href="2sa_note.htm#fn586"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> the king gave this order to you and Abishai and Ittai, `Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.'<a name="fnB587" href="2sa_note.htm#fn587"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13 If I had acted at risk of my own life<a name="fnB588" href="2sa_note.htm#fn588"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a>--and nothing is hidden from the king!--you would have abandoned me."<a name="fnB589" href="2sa_note.htm#fn589"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 14>14  Joab replied, "I will not wait around like this for you!" He took three spears in his hand and thrust them into Absalom's heart while he was still alive in the oak tree.<a name="fnB590" href="2sa_note.htm#fn590"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  Then ten soldiers who were armor bearers for Joab struck Absalom and put him to death.<p>

<bqverse 16>16  Then Joab blew the horn<a name="fnB591" href="2sa_note.htm#fn591"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> and the army turned back from chasing Israel, for Joab had called for the army to halt. 
<bqverse 17>17  They took Absalom, threw him into a large pit in the forest, and stacked a very large pile of stones over him. In the meantime all the men of Israel went home.<a name="fnB592" href="2sa_note.htm#fn592"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 18>18  Prior to this<a name="fnB593" href="2sa_note.htm#fn593"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> Absalom had set up a pillar and dedicated it to himself in the King's Valley, reasoning "I have no son who will carry on my name." He named the pillar after himself, and to this very day it is known as Absalom's Memorial.<a name="_Toc494011946"></a></p>
<p><i>David Learns of Absalom</i>'<i>s Death</i>
<p>
<bqverse 19>19  Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, "Let me run and give the king the good news that the LORD has vindicated him before his enemies.<a name="fnB594" href="2sa_note.htm#fn594"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  But Joab said to him, "You will not be a bearer of good news today. You will bear good news some other day, but not today,<a name="fnB595" href="2sa_note.htm#fn595"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> for the king's son is dead."<p>

<bqverse 21>21  Then Joab said to the Cushite, "Go and tell the king what you have seen." After bowing to Joab, the Cushite ran off. 
<bqverse 22>22  Ahimaaz the son of Zadok again spoke to Joab, "Whatever happens, let me go after the Cushite." But Joab said, "Why is it that you want to go, my son? You have no good news that will bring you a reward." 
<bqverse 23>23  But he said,<a name="fnB596" href="2sa_note.htm#fn596"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> "Whatever happens, I want to go!" So he said to him, "Then go!" So Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Jordan plain, and he passed the Cushite.<p>

<bqverse 24>24  Now David was sitting between the two gates, and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate at the wall. When he looked, he saw a man running by himself. 
<bqverse 25>25  So the watchman called out and informed the king. The king said, "If he is by himself, he brings good news."<a name="fnB597" href="2sa_note.htm#fn597"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> The runner<a name="fnB598" href="2sa_note.htm#fn598"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> came ever closer.<p>

<bqverse 26>26 Then the watchman saw another man running. The watchman called out to the gatekeeper, "There is another man running by himself." The king said, "This one also is bringing good news." 
<bqverse 27>27  The watchman said, "It appears to me that the first runner is Ahimaaz<a name="fnB599" href="2sa_note.htm#fn599"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> the son of Zadok." The king said, "He is a good man, and he comes with good news."<p>

<bqverse 28>28  Then Ahimaaz called out and said to the king, "Greetings!"<a name="fnB600" href="2sa_note.htm#fn600"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> He bowed down before the king with his face toward the ground and said, "May the LORD your God be praised because he has defeated<a name="fnB601" href="2sa_note.htm#fn601"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> the men who opposed<a name="fnB602" href="2sa_note.htm#fn602"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> my lord the king!"<p>

<bqverse 29>29  The king replied, "How is the young man Absalom?" Ahimaaz replied, "I saw a great deal of confusion when Joab was sending the king's servant and me, your servant, but I don't know what it was all about." 
<bqverse 30>30  The king said, "Turn aside and take your place here." So he turned aside and waited. <p>

<bqverse 31>31  Then the Cushite came and said,<a name="fnB603" href="2sa_note.htm#fn603"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> "May my lord the king now receive the good news. The LORD has vindicated you today and delivered you from the hand of all who have rebelled against you!"<a name="fnB604" href="2sa_note.htm#fn604"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 32>32  The king asked the Cushite, "How is the young man Absalom?" The Cushite replied, "May the enemies of my lord the king and all who have plotted against you<a name="fnB605" href="2sa_note.htm#fn605"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> be like this youth!"<p>

<bqverse 33>33 <i>(19.1)</i><a name="fnB606" href="2sa_note.htm#fn606"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> The king then became very upset. He went up to the upper room over the gate and wept. As he went he said, "My son, Absalom! My son, my son,<a name="fnB607" href="2sa_note.htm#fn607"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> Absalom! If only I could have died in your place! Absalom, my son, my son!<a name="fnB608" href="2sa_note.htm#fn608"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqchapter 19><A NAME="19"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b><i>(19.2)</i>Joab was told, "The king is weeping and mourning over Absalom." 
<bqverse 2>2  So the victory of that day was turned to mourning as far as all the people were concerned. For the people heard on that day, "The king is grieved over his son." 
<bqverse 3>3  That day the people stole away to go to the city the way people who are embarrassed steal away in fleeing from battle. 
<bqverse 4>4  The king covered his face and cried out loudly,<a name="fnB609" href="2sa_note.htm#fn609"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> "My son, Absalom! Absalom, my son, my son!"<p>

<bqverse 5>5  So Joab visited<a name="fnB610" href="2sa_note.htm#fn610"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> the king at his home. He said, "Today you have embarrassed all your servants who have saved your life today, as well as the lives of your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your concubines. 
<bqverse 6>6  You seem to love your enemies and hate your friends! For you have as much as declared today that leaders and servants don't matter to you. I realize now<a name="fnB611" href="2sa_note.htm#fn611"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> that if<a name="fnB612" href="2sa_note.htm#fn612"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today,<a name="fnB613" href="2sa_note.htm#fn613"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> it would be all right with you. 
<bqverse 7>7  So get up now and go out and give some encouragement to<a name="fnB614" href="2sa_note.htm#fn614"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> your servants. For I swear by the LORD that if you don't go out there, not a single man will stay here with you tonight. This disaster will be worse for you than any disaster that has overtaken you from your youth to the present time."<p>

<bqverse 8>8  So the king got up and sat at the gate. When all the people were informed that the king was sitting at the gate, they<a name="fnB615" href="2sa_note.htm#fn615"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> all came before him.<a name="_Toc494011947"></a></p>
<p><i>David Goes Back to Jerusalem</i>
<p>But the men of Israel<a name="fnB616" href="2sa_note.htm#fn616"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> had all gone home.<a name="fnB617" href="2sa_note.htm#fn617"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  All the people throughout all the tribes of Israel were arguing among themselves saying, "The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies. He rescued us from the hand of the Philistines, but now he has fled from the land because of Absalom. 
<bqverse 10>10  But Absalom whom we anointed as our king<a name="fnB618" href="2sa_note.htm#fn618"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> has died in battle. So now why do you hesitate to bring the king back?"<a name="fnB619" href="2sa_note.htm#fn619"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 11>11  Then King David sent a message to Zadok and Abiathar the priests saying, "Tell the elders of Israel, `Why should you delay any further in bringing the king back to his palace,<a name="fnB620" href="2sa_note.htm#fn620"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> when everything Israel is saying has come to the king's attention.<a name="fnB621" href="2sa_note.htm#fn621"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  You are my brothers--my very flesh and blood!<a name="fnB622" href="2sa_note.htm#fn622"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> Why should you delay any further in bringing the king back?' 
<bqverse 13>13  Say to Amasa, `Are you not my flesh and blood?<a name="fnB623" href="2sa_note.htm#fn623"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> God will punish me severely,<a name="fnB624" href="2sa_note.htm#fn624"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> if from this time on you are not the commander of my army in place of Joab.'"<p>

<bqverse 14>14  He won over the hearts of all the men of Judah as though they were one man. Then they sent word to the king saying, "Return, you and all your servants as well." 
<bqverse 15>15  So the king returned and came to the Jordan River.<a name="fnB625" href="2sa_note.htm#fn625"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> <p>
Now the people of Judah<a name="fnB626" href="2sa_note.htm#fn626"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> had come to Gilgal to meet the king and to help him<a name="fnB627" href="2sa_note.htm#fn627"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> cross the Jordan. 
<bqverse 16>16  Shimei son of Gera the Benjamite from Bahurim came down quickly with the men of Judah to meet King David. 
<bqverse 17>17  There were a thousand men with him from Benjamin, along with Ziba the servant<a name="fnB628" href="2sa_note.htm#fn628"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> of Saul's house, and with him his fifteen sons and twenty servants. They crossed<a name="fnB629" href="2sa_note.htm#fn629"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> the Jordan within sight of the king. 
<bqverse 18>18  They crossed at the ford in order to help the king's household cross and to do whatever he thought appropriate.<p>
Now after he had crossed the Jordan, Shimei son of Gera fell before the king. 
<bqverse 19>19  He said to the king, "Don't think badly of me, my lord, and don't recall the sin of your servant on the day that you, my lord the king, left<a name="fnB630" href="2sa_note.htm#fn630"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> Jerusalem. Please don't call it to mind. 
<bqverse 20>20  For I, your servant,<a name="fnB631" href="2sa_note.htm#fn631"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> know that I sinned, and I have come today as the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king."<p>

<bqverse 21>21  Abishai son of Zeruiah replied, "For this should not Shimei be put to death? After all, he cursed the LORD's anointed!" 
<bqverse 22>22  But David said, "What do we have in common,<a name="fnB632" href="2sa_note.htm#fn632"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> you sons of Zeruiah? You are like my enemy today. Should anyone be put to death in Israel today? Don't you realize that today I am king over Israel?" 
<bqverse 23>23  The king said to Shimei, "You won't die." The king took an oath<a name="fnB633" href="2sa_note.htm#fn633"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> concerning this.<p>

<bqverse 24>24  Now Mephibosheth, Saul's grandson,<a name="fnB634" href="2sa_note.htm#fn634"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> came down to meet the king. From the day the king had left until the day he safely<a name="fnB635" href="2sa_note.htm#fn635"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> returned, Mephibosheth<a name="fnB636" href="2sa_note.htm#fn636"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> had not cut his toenails<a name="fnB637" href="2sa_note.htm#fn637"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> nor trimmed<a name="fnB638" href="2sa_note.htm#fn638"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> his mustache nor washed his garments.<p>

<bqverse 25>25 When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, "Why didn't you go with me, Mephibosheth?" 
<bqverse 26>26  He replied, "My lord the king, my servant deceived me. I<a name="fnB639" href="2sa_note.htm#fn639"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> said, `Let me get my donkey saddled so that I can ride on it and go with the king,' for I<a name="fnB640" href="2sa_note.htm#fn640"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> am lame. 
<bqverse 27>27  But my servant<a name="fnB641" href="2sa_note.htm#fn641"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> has slandered me<a name="fnB642" href="2sa_note.htm#fn642"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> to my lord the king. But my lord the king is like an angel of God. Do whatever seems appropriate to you. 
<bqverse 28>28  After all, there was no one in the entire house of my grandfather<a name="fnB643" href="2sa_note.htm#fn643"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> who did not deserve death from my lord the king. But instead you allowed me to eat at your own table.<a name="fnB644" href="2sa_note.htm#fn644"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> What further claim do I have to ask<a name="fnB645" href="2sa_note.htm#fn645"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> the king for anything?"<p>

<bqverse 29>29  Then the king replied to him, "Why should you continue speaking like this? You and Ziba will inherit the field together." 
<bqverse 30>30  Mephibosheth said to the king, "Let him have<a name="fnB646" href="2sa_note.htm#fn646"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> the whole thing! My lord the king has returned safely<a name="fnB647" href="2sa_note.htm#fn647"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> to his house!" <p>

<bqverse 31>31  Now when Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim, he crossed the Jordan with the king so he could send him on his way from there.<a name="fnB648" href="2sa_note.htm#fn648"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 32>32  But Barzillai was very old--eighty years old, in fact--and he had taken care of the king when he stayed in Mahanaim, for he was a very rich<a name="fnB649" href="2sa_note.htm#fn649"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> man. 
<bqverse 33>33  So the king said to Barzillai, "Cross over with me, and I will take care of you while you are with me in Jerusalem."<p>

<bqverse 34>34  Barzillai replied to the king, "How many days do I have left to my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem? 
<bqverse 35>35  I am presently eighty years old. Am I able to discern good and bad? Can I<a name="fnB650" href="2sa_note.htm#fn650"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> taste what I eat and drink? Am I still able to hear the voices of male and female singers? Why should I<a name="fnB651" href="2sa_note.htm#fn651"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> continue to be a burden to my lord the king? 
<bqverse 36>36  I will cross the Jordan with the king and go a short distance.<a name="fnB652" href="2sa_note.htm#fn652"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> Why should the king reward me in this way? 
<bqverse 37>37  Let me<a name="fnB653" href="2sa_note.htm#fn653"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> return so that I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and my mother. But look, here is your servant Kimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king. Do for him whatever seems appropriate to you." <p>

<bqverse 38>38  The king replied, "Kimham will cross over with me, and I will do for him whatever I deem appropriate. And whatever you choose, I will do for you."<p>

<bqverse 39>39  So all the people crossed the Jordan, as did the king. After the king had kissed him and blessed him, Barzillai returned to his home.<a name="fnB654" href="2sa_note.htm#fn654"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 40>40  When the king crossed over to Gilgal, Kimham<a name="fnB655" href="2sa_note.htm#fn655"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> crossed over with him. Now all the soldiers<a name="fnB656" href="2sa_note.htm#fn656"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> of Judah along with half of the soldiers of Israel had helped the king cross over.<a name="fnB657" href="2sa_note.htm#fn657"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 41>41  Then all the men of Israel began coming to the king. They asked the king, "Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, sneak the king away and help the king and his household cross the Jordan--and not only him but all of David's men as well?" <p>
 
<bqverse 42>42  All the men of Judah replied to the men of Israel, "Because the king is our close relative. Why are you so upset about this? Have we eaten at the king's expense?<a name="fnB658" href="2sa_note.htm#fn658"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> Or have we misappropriated anything for our own use?" 
<bqverse 43>43  The men of Israel replied to the men of Judah, "We have ten shares in the king, and we have a greater claim on David than you do. Why do you want<a name="fnB659" href="2sa_note.htm#fn659"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> to curse us? Weren't we the first to suggest bringing back our king?" But the comments of the men of Judah were more severe than those of the men of Israel.

<p><i>Sheba</i>'<i>s Rebellion</i>
<p><A NAME="20"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Now a wicked man<a name="fnB660" href="2sa_note.htm#fn660"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> named Sheba son of Bicri, a Benjamite,<a name="fnB661" href="2sa_note.htm#fn661"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> happened to be there. He blew the horn<a name="fnB662" href="2sa_note.htm#fn662"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> and said,</p>
<br>"We have no share in David; <br>
we have no inheritance in this son of Jesse!<br>
Every man go home,<a name="fnB663" href="2sa_note.htm#fn663"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> O Israel!"</ul><p>
<bqverse 2>2  So all the men of Israel deserted<a name="fnB664" href="2sa_note.htm#fn664"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> David and followed Sheba son of Bicri. But the men of Judah stuck by their king all the way from the Jordan River<a name="fnB665" href="2sa_note.htm#fn665"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> to Jerusalem.<p>

<bqverse 3>3  Then David went to his palace<a name="fnB666" href="2sa_note.htm#fn666"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> in Jerusalem. The king took the ten concubines that he had left to care for the palace and placed them under confinement.<a name="fnB667" href="2sa_note.htm#fn667"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> Though he provided for their needs, he did not have sexual relations with them.<a name="fnB668" href="2sa_note.htm#fn668"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> They remained in confinement until the day they died, living out the rest of their lives as widows.<p>

<bqverse 4>4  Then the king said to Amasa, "Call the men of Judah together for me in three days,<a name="fnB669" href="2sa_note.htm#fn669"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and you be present here with them too." 
<bqverse 5>5  So Amasa went out to call Judah together. But in doing so he took longer than the time that the king had allotted him.<p>

<bqverse 6>6  Then David said to Abishai, "Now Sheba son of Bicri will cause greater disaster for us than Absalom did. Take your lord's servants and pursue him. Otherwise he will secure<a name="fnB670" href="2sa_note.htm#fn670"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> for himself fortified cities and get away from us." 
<bqverse 7>7  So Joab's men, accompanied by the Kerethites, the Pelethites, and all the warriors, left Jerusalem to pursue Sheba son of Bicri.<p>

<bqverse 8>8  When they were near the big rock that is in Gibeon, Amasa came to them. Now Joab was dressed in military attire and had a dagger in its sheath belted to his waist. When he advanced, it fell out.<a name="fnB671" href="2sa_note.htm#fn671"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 9>9  Joab said to Amasa, "How are you, my brother?" With his right hand Joab took hold of the beard of Amasa as if to greet him with a kiss. 
<bqverse 10>10  Amasa did not protect himself from the knife in Joab's hand, and Joab<a name="fnB672" href="2sa_note.htm#fn672"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> stabbed him in the belly, causing Amasa's<a name="fnB673" href="2sa_note.htm#fn673"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> intestines to spill out on the ground. There was no need to stab him again; the first blow was fatal.<a name="fnB674" href="2sa_note.htm#fn674"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba son of Bicri.<p>

<bqverse 11>11  One of Joab's soldiers who stood over Amasa said, "Whoever is for<a name="fnB675" href="2sa_note.htm#fn675"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> Joab and whoever is for David, follow Joab!" 
<bqverse 12>12  Amasa was squirming in his own blood in the middle of the path, and this man had noticed that all the soldiers stopped. Having noticed that everyone who came across Amasa<a name="fnB676" href="2sa_note.htm#fn676"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> stopped, the man<a name="fnB677" href="2sa_note.htm#fn677"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> pulled him<a name="fnB678" href="2sa_note.htm#fn678"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> away from the path and into the field and threw a garment over him. 
<bqverse 13>13  Once he had removed Amasa<a name="fnB679" href="2sa_note.htm#fn679"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> from the path, everyone followed Joab to pursue Sheba son of Bicri. <p>

<bqverse 14>14  Sheba<a name="fnB680" href="2sa_note.htm#fn680"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> traveled through all the tribes of Israel to Abel of<a name="fnB681" href="2sa_note.htm#fn681"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> Beth Maacah and all the Berite area. When they had assembled,<a name="fnB682" href="2sa_note.htm#fn682"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> they too joined him. 
<bqverse 15>15  So Joab's men<a name="fnB683" href="2sa_note.htm#fn683"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> came and laid siege against him in Abel of Beth Maacah. They prepared a siege ramp outside the city which stood against its outer rampart. As all of Joab's soldiers were trying to break through<a name="fnB684" href="2sa_note.htm#fn684"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> the wall so that it would collapse, 
<bqverse 16>16  a wise woman called out from the city, "Listen up! Listen up! Tell Joab, `Come near so that I may speak to you.'"<p>

<bqverse 17>17  When he approached her, the woman asked, "Are you Joab?" He replied, "I am." She said to him, "Listen to the words of your servant." He said, "Go ahead. I'm listening." 
<bqverse 18>18  She said, "In the past they would always say, `Let them inquire in Abel,' and in this way they settled things. 
<bqverse 19>19  I represent the peaceful and the faithful in Israel. You are attempting to destroy an important city<a name="fnB685" href="2sa_note.htm#fn685"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> in Israel. Why should you swallow up the LORD's inheritance?"<p>

<bqverse 20>20  Joab answered, "Get serious!<a name="fnB686" href="2sa_note.htm#fn686"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> I don't want to swallow up or destroy anything! 
<bqverse 21>21  That's not the way things are. There is a man from the hill country of Ephraim named Sheba son of Bicri. He has rebelled<a name="fnB687" href="2sa_note.htm#fn687"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> against king David. Give me just this one man, and I will leave the city." The woman said to Joab, "This very minute<a name="fnB688" href="2sa_note.htm#fn688"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> his head will be thrown over the wall to you!"<p>

<bqverse 22>22  Then the woman went to all the people with her wise advice and they cut off Sheba's head and threw it out to Joab. Joab<a name="fnB689" href="2sa_note.htm#fn689"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> blew the horn, and his men<a name="fnB690" href="2sa_note.htm#fn690"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> dispersed from the city, each going to his home.<a name="fnB691" href="2sa_note.htm#fn691"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> Joab returned to the king in Jerusalem.<p>

<bqverse 23>23  Now Joab was the general of all the army of Israel. Benaiah the son of Jehoida was over the Kerethites and the Perethites. 
<bqverse 24>24  Adoniram<a name="fnB692" href="2sa_note.htm#fn692"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> was supervisor of the work crews.<a name="fnB693" href="2sa_note.htm#fn693"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the secretary. 
<bqverse 25>25  Sheva was the scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests. 
<bqverse 26>26  Ira the Jairite was David's private priest.<a name="fnB694" href="2sa_note.htm#fn694"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>The Gibeonites Demand Revenge</i>
<p><A NAME="21"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> During David's reign there was a famine for three consecutive years. So David inquired of the LORD.<a name="fnB695" href="2sa_note.htm#fn695"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> The LORD said, "It is because of Saul and his bloodstained family,<a name="fnB696" href="2sa_note.htm#fn696"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> because he murdered the Gibeonites."<p>

<bqverse 2>2 So the king summoned the Gibeonites and spoke with them. (Now the Gibeonites were not descendants of Israel; they were a remnant of the Amorites. The Israelites had made a promise to<a name="fnB697" href="2sa_note.htm#fn697"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> them, but Saul tried to kill them because of his zeal for the people of Israel and Judah.) 
<bqverse 3>3  David said to the Gibeonites, "What can I do for you, and how can I make amends so that you will bless<a name="fnB698" href="2sa_note.htm#fn698"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD's inheritance?" <p>

<bqverse 4>4  The Gibeonites said to him, "We<a name="fnB699" href="2sa_note.htm#fn699"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> have no claim to silver or gold from Saul or from his family,<a name="fnB700" href="2sa_note.htm#fn700"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> nor would we be justified in putting to death anyone in Israel." David asked,<a name="fnB701" href="2sa_note.htm#fn701"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> "What then are you asking me to do for you?" 
<bqverse 5>5  They replied to the king, "As for this man who exterminated us and who schemed against us so that we were destroyed and left without status throughout all the borders of Israel-- 
<bqverse 6>6  let seven of his male descendants be turned over to us, and we will execute<a name="fnB702" href="2sa_note.htm#fn702"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> them before the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, who was the LORD's chosen one."<a name="fnB703" href="2sa_note.htm#fn703"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> The king replied, "I will turn them over." <p>

<bqverse 7>7  The king had mercy on Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, in light of the LORD's oath that had been taken between David and Jonathan son of Saul. 
<bqverse 8>8  So the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Aiah's daughter Rizpah whom she had born to Saul, and the five sons of Saul's daughter Michal whom she had born to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite.
<bqverse 9>9  He turned them over to the Gibeonites, and they executed them on a hill before the LORD. The seven of them<a name="fnB704" href="2sa_note.htm#fn704"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> died<a name="fnB705" href="2sa_note.htm#fn705"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> together; they were put to death during harvest time--during the first days of the beginning<a name="fnB706" href="2sa_note.htm#fn706"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> of the barley harvest. <p>

<bqverse 10>10  Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock. From the beginning of the harvest until the rain fell on them,<a name="fnB707" href="2sa_note.htm#fn707"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> she did not allow the birds of the air to feed<a name="fnB708" href="2sa_note.htm#fn708"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> on them by day, nor the animals of the field by night.
<bqverse 11>11  When David was told what Rizpah daughter of Aiah, Saul's concubine, had done, 
<bqverse 12>12 he<a name="fnB709" href="2sa_note.htm#fn709"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> went and took the bones of Saul and of his son Jonathan<a name="fnB710" href="2sa_note.htm#fn710"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> from the leaders<a name="fnB711" href="2sa_note.htm#fn711"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> of Jabesh Gilead. (They had taken<a name="fnB712" href="2sa_note.htm#fn712"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> them from the plaza at Beth Shan. It was there that Philistines<a name="fnB713" href="2sa_note.htm#fn713"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> publicly exposed their corpses<a name="fnB714" href="2sa_note.htm#fn714"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> after<a name="fnB715" href="2sa_note.htm#fn715"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> they<a name="fnB716" href="2sa_note.htm#fn716"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> had killed Saul at Gilboa.) 
<bqverse 13>13  David<a name="fnB717" href="2sa_note.htm#fn717"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> brought the bones of Saul and of his son Jonathan his son from there; they also gathered up the bones of those who had been executed.<p>

<bqverse 14>14  They buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the land of Benjamin at Zela in the grave of his father Kish. After they had done everything<a name="fnB718" href="2sa_note.htm#fn718"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> that the king had commanded, God responded to their prayers<a name="fnB719" href="2sa_note.htm#fn719"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> for the land.<a name="_Toc494011950"></a></p>
<p><i>Israel Engages in Various Battles with the Philistines</i>
<p>
<bqverse 15>15  Another battle was fought between the Philistines and Israel. So David went down with his soldiers<a name="fnB720" href="2sa_note.htm#fn720"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> and fought the Philistines. David became exhausted. 
<bqverse 16>16  Now Ishbi-Benob, who was one of the descendants of Rapha,<a name="fnB721" href="2sa_note.htm#fn721"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> had a spear<a name="fnB722" href="2sa_note.htm#fn722"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> that weighed three hundred bronze shekels,<a name="fnB723" href="2sa_note.htm#fn723"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> and he was armed with a new weapon.<a name="fnB724" href="2sa_note.htm#fn724"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> He had said that he would kill David. 
<bqverse 17>17  But Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to David's aid, striking the Philistine down and killing him. Then David's men took an oath saying, "You will not go out to battle with us again! You must not extinguish the lamp of Israel!<p>

<bqverse 18>18  Later there was another battle with the Philistines, this time in Gob. On that occasion Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was one of the descendants of Rapha. 
<bqverse 19>19  Yet another battle occurred with the Philistines in Gob. On that occasion Elhanan the son of Jair<a name="fnB725" href="2sa_note.htm#fn725"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> the Bethlehemite killed the brother of Goliath the Gittite,<a name="fnB726" href="2sa_note.htm#fn726"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. 
<bqverse 20>20  Yet another battle occurred in Gath. On that occasion there was a large man<a name="fnB727" href="2sa_note.htm#fn727"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in all! He too was a descendant of Rapha. 
<bqverse 21>21  When he taunted Israel, Jonathan, the son of David's brother Shimeah, killed him. 
<bqverse 22>22  These four were the descendants of Rapha who lived in Gath; they were killed<a name="fnB728" href="2sa_note.htm#fn728"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> by David and his soldiers.<a name="fnB729" href="2sa_note.htm#fn729"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 9>9  Next in command<a name="fnB869" href="2sa_note.htm#fn869"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> was Eleazar son of Dodo,<a name="fnB870" href="2sa_note.htm#fn870"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> the son of Ahohi. He was one of the three warriors who were with David when they defied the Philistines who were assembled there for battle. When the men of Israel retreated,<a name="fnB871" href="2sa_note.htm#fn871"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  he stood his ground<a name="fnB872" href="2sa_note.htm#fn872"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> and fought the Philistines until his hand grew so tired that it<a name="fnB873" href="2sa_note.htm#fn873"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> seemed stuck to his sword. The LORD gave a great victory on that day. When the army returned to him, the only thing left to do was to plunder the corpses.<p>

<bqverse 11>11  Next in command<a name="fnB874" href="2sa_note.htm#fn874"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines assembled at Lehi,<a name="fnB875" href="2sa_note.htm#fn875"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> where there happened to be an area of a field that was full of lentils, the army retreated before the Philistines. 
<bqverse 12>12  But he made a stand in the middle of that area. He defended<a name="fnB876" href="2sa_note.htm#fn876"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> it and defeated the Philistines; the LORD gave them a great victory.<p>

<bqverse 13>13  At the time of<a name="fnB877" href="2sa_note.htm#fn877"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> the harvest three<a name="fnB878" href="2sa_note.htm#fn878"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> of the thirty leaders went down to<a name="fnB879" href="2sa_note.htm#fn879"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> David at the cave of Adullam. A band of Philistines was camped in the valley of Rephaim. 
<bqverse 14>14  David was in the stronghold at the time, while a Philistine garrison was in Bethlehem. 
<bqverse 15>15  David was thirsty and said, "How I wish someone would give me some water to drink from the cistern in Bethlehem near the gate!" 
<bqverse 16>16  So three elite warriors broke through the Philistine forces and drew some water from the cistern in Bethlehem near the gate. They carried it back to David, but he refused to drink it. He poured it out as a drink offering to the LORD 
<bqverse 17>17  and said, "O LORD, I will not do this!<a name="fnB880" href="2sa_note.htm#fn880"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> It is equivalent to the blood of the men who risked their lives by going."<a name="fnB881" href="2sa_note.htm#fn881"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> So he refused to drink it. Such were the exploits of the three elite warriors.<a name="fnB882" href="2sa_note.htm#fn882"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 18>18  Abishai son of Zeruiah, the brother of Joab, was head of the three.<a name="fnB883" href="2sa_note.htm#fn883"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> He killed three hundred men with his spear and gained fame among the three.<a name="fnB884" href="2sa_note.htm#fn884"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  From<a name="fnB885" href="2sa_note.htm#fn885"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> the three he was given honor and he became their officer, even though he was not one of the three.<p>

<bqverse 20>20  Benaiah son of Jehoida was a brave warrior<a name="fnB886" href="2sa_note.htm#fn886"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> from Kabzeel who performed great exploits. He struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab.<a name="fnB887" href="2sa_note.htm#fn887"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> He also went down and killed a lion in a cistern on a snowy day. 
<bqverse 21>21  He also killed an impressive-looking Egyptian.<a name="fnB888" href="2sa_note.htm#fn888"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> The Egyptian wielded a spear, while Benaiah attacked<a name="fnB889" href="2sa_note.htm#fn889"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> him with a club. He grabbed the spear out of the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear. 
<bqverse 22>22  Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoida, who gained fame among the three elite warriors. 
<bqverse 23>23  He received honor from<a name="fnB890" href="2sa_note.htm#fn890"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> the thirty warriors, though he was not one of the three elite warriors. David put him in charge of his bodyguard.<p>

<bqverse 24>24  Included with the thirty were the following: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem, 
<bqverse 25>25  Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,

<p><i>David Displeases the LORD by Taking a Census</i>
<p><A NAME="24"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> The LORD's anger again raged against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, "Go count Israel and Judah."<a name="fnB895" href="2sa_note.htm#fn895"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 2>2  The king told Joab, the general of his army, "Go through all the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and muster the army, so I may know the size of the army."<p>

<bqverse 3>3  Joab replied to the king, "May the LORD your God make the army a hundred times larger right before the eyes of my lord the king! But why does my master the king want to do this?"<p>

<bqverse 4>4  But the king's edict stood, despite the objections of<a name="fnB896" href="2sa_note.htm#fn896"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> Joab and the leaders of the army. So Joab and the leaders of the army left the king's presence in order to muster the Israelite army.<p>

<bqverse 5>5  They crossed the Jordan and camped at Aroer, on the south side of the city, at<a name="fnB897" href="2sa_note.htm#fn897"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> the wadi of Gad, near Jazer. 
<bqverse 6>6  Then they went on to Gilead and to the region of Tahtim Hodshi, coming to Dan Jaan and on around to Sidon. 
<bqverse 7>7  Then they went to the fortress of Tyre and all the cities of the Hivites and the Canaanites. Then they went on to the Negev of Judah, to Beersheba. 
<bqverse 8>8  They went through all the land and, after nine months and twenty days, came back to Jerusalem.<p>

<bqverse 9>9  Joab reported the number of warriors<a name="fnB898" href="2sa_note.htm#fn898"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> to the king. In Israel there were eight hundred thousand sword-wielding warriors, and in Judah there were five hundred thousand soldiers. <p>

<bqverse 10>10  David felt guilty<a name="fnB899" href="2sa_note.htm#fn899"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> after he had numbered the army. David said to the LORD, "I have sinned greatly by doing this. Now, O LORD, please remove the guilt of your servant, for I have acted very foolishly."<p>

<bqverse 11>11  When David got up the next morning, the LORD had already spoken<a name="fnB900" href="2sa_note.htm#fn900"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> to Gad the prophet, David's seer: 
<bqverse 12>12 "Go, tell David, `This is what the LORD says: I am offering you three forms of judgment. Pick one of them and I will carry it out against you.'" <p>

<bqverse 13>13  Gad went to David and told him, "Shall seven<a name="fnB901" href="2sa_note.htm#fn901"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> years of famine come upon your land? Or shall you flee for three months from your enemy with him in hot pursuit? Or shall there be three days of plague in your land? Now decide<a name="fnB902" href="2sa_note.htm#fn902"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> what should I tell the one who sent me." 
<bqverse 14>14  David said to Gad, "I am very upset! I prefer that we be attacked by the LORD, for his mercy is great; I do not want to be attacked by men!"<a name="fnB903" href="2sa_note.htm#fn903"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 15>15  So the LORD sent a plague through Israel from the morning until the completion of the appointed time. Seventy thousand men died from Dan to Beersheba. 
<bqverse 16>16  When the angel<a name="fnB904" href="2sa_note.htm#fn904"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> extended his hand to destroy Jerusalem, the LORD relented from his judgment.<a name="fnB905" href="2sa_note.htm#fn905"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> He told the angel who was killing the people, "That's enough! Stop now!"<a name="fnB906" href="2sa_note.htm#fn906"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> Now the LORD's angel was near the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.<p>

<bqverse 17>17  When he saw the angel who was destroying the people, David said to the LORD, "Look, it is I who have sinned and done this evil thing. As for these sheep--what have they done? Attack me and my family."<a name="fnB907" href="2sa_note.htm#fn907"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> <a name="_Toc494011955"></a></p>
<p><i>David Acquires a Threshing Floor and Constructs an Altar There</i>
<p>
<bqverse 18>18  So Gad went to David that day and told him, "Go up and build an altar for the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite." 
<bqverse 19>19  So David went up as Gad instructed him to do, according to the LORD's instructions. <p>

<bqverse 20>20  When Araunah looked out and saw the king and his servants approaching him, he<a name="fnB908" href="2sa_note.htm#fn908"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> went out and bowed to the king with his face<a name="fnB909" href="2sa_note.htm#fn909"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> to the ground. 
<bqverse 21>21  Araunah said, "Why has my lord the king come to his servant?" David replied, "To buy from you the threshing floor so I can build an altar for the LORD, so that the plague may be removed from the people." 
<bqverse 22>22 Araunah<b> </b>told David, "My lord the king may take whatever he wishes<a name="fnB910" href="2sa_note.htm#fn910"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> and offer it. Look! Here are oxen for burnt offerings, and threshing sledges<a name="fnB911" href="2sa_note.htm#fn911"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> and harnesses<a name="fnB912" href="2sa_note.htm#fn912"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> for wood. 
<bqverse 23>23  I, the servant of my lord<a name="fnB913" href="2sa_note.htm#fn913"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> the king, give it all to the king!" Araunah also told the king, "May the LORD your God show you favor!" 
<bqverse 24>24  But the king said to Araunah, "No, I insist on buying it from you. I will not offer to the LORD my God burnt sacrifices that cost me nothing."<p>
So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty pieces of silver.<a name="fnB914" href="2sa_note.htm#fn914"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  Then David built an altar for the LORD there and offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings. Then the LORD accepted prayers for the land, and the plague was removed from Israel.</p>
