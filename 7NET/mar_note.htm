 <b>sn</b> (1:1)  By the time Mark wrote, the word <i>gospel</i> had become a technical term referring to the preaching about Jesus Christ and God's saving power accomplished through him for all who believe (cf. Rom 1:16). <br>
 <a name="fn1" href="mar.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tc </b> (1:1) <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT>*<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek"> Q</FONT> 28 <i>et pauci</i> omit <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uiJou' qeou'</FONT>, while virtually all the rest of the witnesses have the words, so the evidence points very strongly for the authenticity of the words. Most likely, the words were omitted by accident, since the last four words of v. 1, in uncial script, would have looked like this: <FONT FACE="GREEK UNCIALS">iu_c_r_u_u_u_q_u_</FONT>. With all the successive <i>upsilons</i> an accidental deletion is likely. Further, the inclusion of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uiJou' qeou'</FONT> here finds its complement in 15:39, where the centurion claims that Jesus was <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uiJoV" qeou'</FONT>. Even though <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> is in general one of the best NT MSS, its testimony is not quite as preeminent in this situation. There are several instances in which it breaks up chains of genitives ending in <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ou</FONT> like this one (cf., e.g., Acts 28:31; Col 2:2; Heb 12:2; Rev 12:14; 15:7; 22:1), showing that there is a significantly higher possibility of accidental scribal omission in a case like this. This christological <i>inclusio</i> parallels both Matthew ("Immanuel . . . God with us" in 1:23/"I am with you" in 28:20) and John ("the Word was God" in 1:1/"My Lord and my God" in 20:28), probably reflecting nascent christological development and articulation.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:1)  The first verse of Mark's Gospel appears to function as a title: <i>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God</i>. It is not certain, however, whether Mark intended it to refer to the entire Gospel, to the ministry of John the Baptist, or through the use of the term <i>beginning</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajrchv</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">arch</FONT>) to allude to Genesis 1:1 (in the Greek Bible, LXX). The most likely option is that the statement as a whole is an allusion to Genesis 1:1 and that Mark is saying that with the "good news" of the coming of Christ, God is commencing a "new beginning." <br>
 <a name="fn2" href="mar.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:2)  Instead of "in Isaiah the prophet" the majority of MSS read "in the prophets" (A E F G H P W <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">S</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Euml;</FONT><sup>13</sup> <i>Byz Lect</i> vg<sup>ms</sup> syr<sup>h</sup> bo<sup>mss</sup> eth slav Irenaeus [Latin translation] Asterius). Except for Irenaeus (2nd century), the earliest evidence for this is thus from the late 4th century (W and Asterius). The difficulty of Irenaeus is that he wrote in Greek but has been preserved largely in Latin. His Greek remains have "in Isaiah the prophet." Only the <i>later</i> Latin translation has "in the prophets." The KJV reading is thus in harmony with the majority of <i>late</i> MSS. On the other hand, the witnesses for "in Isaiah the prophet" (either with the article before Isaiah or not) are early and geographically widespread: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> B L <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">D</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Q</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Euml;</FONT><sup>1</sup> 33 205 565 700 892 1071 1241 1243 2427 it (such as a, aur, b, c, d, f, ff<sup>2</sup>, l, q) vg syr<sup>p,pal</sup> cop geo arm Irenaeus (Greek) Origen Serapion Epiphanius Severian Cyril-Jerusalem Hesychius Victorinus-Pettau Chromatius Ambrosiaster Jerome (who has a variant of this reading) Augustine <i>et alii</i>. This evidence runs deep into the 2nd century, is widespread, and is found in the most important Alexandrian, Western, and Caesarean witnesses. The "Isaiah" reading has a better external pedigree in every way. It has the support of the earliest and best witnesses from all the texttypes that matter. It is widespread throughout the Mediterranean world, and from a very early period. <br>
 <a name="fn3" href="mar.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:2)  The opening lines of the quotation are from Exod 23:20; Mal 3:1.

 <a name="fn4" href="mar.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:3)  This call to "make his paths straight" in this context is probably an allusion to preparation through repentance.<br>

 <a name="fn8" href="mar.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:4)  <i>A baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins</i> was a call for preparation for the arrival of the Lord's salvation. To participate in this baptism was a recognition of the need for God's forgiveness with a sense that one needed to live differently as a response to it.<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="mar.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Grk</i> "And the whole Judean countryside." Mark uses the Greek conjunction <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>) at numerous places in his Gospel to begin sentences and paragraphs. This practice is due to Semitic influence and reflects in many cases the use of the Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">w </FONT>(<i>waw</i>) which is used in OT narrative, much as it is here, to carry the narrative along. Because in contemporary English style it is not acceptable to begin every sentence with "and," <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> was often left untranslated or rendered as "now," "so," "then," or "but" depending on the context. When left untranslated it has not been noted. When given an alternative translation, this is usually indicated by a note. <br>
 <a name="fn10" href="mar.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Grk</i> "they were being baptized by him." The passive construction has been rendered as active in the translation for the sake of English style.<br>
 <a name="fn11" href="mar.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:6)  John's lifestyle was in stark contrast to many of the religious leaders of Jerusalem who lived in relative ease and luxury. While his clothing and diet were indicative of someone who lived in the desert, they also depicted him in his role as God's prophet (cf. Zech 13:4); his appearance is similar to the Prophet Elijah (2 Kgs 1:8). <i>Locusts</i> <i>and wild honey</i> were a common diet in desert regions and locusts (dried insects) are listed in Lev 11:22 among the "clean" foods. <br>
 <a name="fn12" href="mar.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  <i>Grk</i> "proclaimed, saying." The participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">levgwn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">legwn</FONT>) is redundant in contemporary English and has not been translated.<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="mar.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  <i>Grk</i> "of whom I am not worthy."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:7)  The humility of John is evident in the statement <i>I am not worthy</i>. This was considered one of the least worthy tasks of a slave, and John did not consider himself worthy to do even that for the one to come, despite the fact he himself was a prophet.<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="mar.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  The term refers to the leather strap or thong used to bind a sandal. This is often viewed as a collective singular and translated as a plural, "the straps of his sandals," but it may be more emphatic to retain the singular here.<br>
 <a name="fn15" href="mar.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  <i>Grk</i> "And." Here <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>) has been translated as "now" to indicate the transition to a new topic.<br>

 <a name="fn19" href="mar.htm#fnB19"><sup>20</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:10)  The phrase <i>like a dove</i> is a descriptive comparison. The Spirit is not a dove, but descended like one in some sort of bodily representation.<br>
 <a name="fn20" href="mar.htm#fnB20"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  <i>Grk </i>"my beloved Son," or "my Son, the beloved [one]." The force of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajgaphtov"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">agaphtos</FONT>) is often "pertaining to one who is the only one of his or her class, but at the same time is particularly loved and cherished" (L&amp;N 58.53; cf. also BAGD 6 s.v. 1).<br>
 <a name="fn21" href="mar.htm#fnB21"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  Or "with you I am well pleased."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:11)  The allusions in the remarks of the text recall Ps 2:7a; Isa 42:1 and either Isa 41:8 or, less likely, Gen 22:12,16. God is marking out Jesus as his chosen one (the meaning of "[in you I take] great delight"), but it may well be that this was a private experience that only Jesus and John saw and heard (cf. John 1:32-33).<br>
 <a name="fn22" href="mar.htm#fnB22"><sup>23</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:13)  The <i>forty days</i> may allude to the experience of Moses (Exod 34:28), Elijah (1 Kgs 19:8, 15) or David and Goliath (1 Sam 17:16).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (1:17)  The kind of fishing envisioned was net--not line--fishing (cf. v. 16; cf. also BAGD 47 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajmfivblhstron,</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajmfibavllw</FONT>) which involved a circular net that had heavy weights around its perimeter. The occupation of fisherman was labor-intensive. The imagery of using a lure and a line (and waiting for the fish to strike) is thus foreign to this text. Rather, the imagery of a fisherman involved much strain, long hours, and often little results. Jesus' point may have been one or more of the following: the strenuousness of evangelism, the work ethic that it required, persistence and dedication to the task (often in spite of minimal results), the infinite value of the new "catch" (viz., people), and perhaps an eschatological theme of snatching people from judgment (cf. W. L. Lane, <i>Mark</i> [NICNT], 67). If this last motif is in view, then catching people is the opposite of catching fish: the fish would be caught, killed, cooked, and eaten; people would be caught so as to remove them from eternal destruction and to give them new life.<br>
 <a name="fn30" href="mar.htm#fnB30"><sup>31</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:18)  The expression <i>followed him</i> pictures discipleship, which means that to learn from Jesus is to follow him as the guiding priority of one's life.<br>
 <a name="fn31" href="mar.htm#fnB31"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:19)  Or "a boat." The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn tw'/ ploivw/</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">en tw ploiw</FONT>) can either refer to a generic boat, some boat (as it seems to do in Matt 4:21); or it can refer to "their" boat, implying possession. Mark assumes a certain preunderstanding on the part of his readers about the first four disciples and hence the translation "their boat" is justified (cf. also v. 20 in which the "hired men" indicates that Zebedee's family owned the boats). <br>
 <a name="fn32" href="mar.htm#fnB32"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:21)  <i>Grk</i> "And." Here <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>) has been translated as "then" to indicate the implied sequence of events within the narrative.<br>
 <a name="fn33" href="mar.htm#fnB33"><sup>34</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:21)  <i>Capernaum</i> was a town located on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee, 680 ft (204 m) below sea level. It was a major trade and economic center in the North Galilean region, and it became the hub of operations for Jesus' Galilean ministry. <br>
 <a name="fn34" href="mar.htm#fnB34"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:21)  <i>Grk</i> "he"; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn35" href="mar.htm#fnB35"><sup>36</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:21)  The<i> synagogue</i> was a place for Jewish prayer and worship, with recognized leadership (cf. Luke 8:41). Though its origin is not entirely clear, it seems to have arisen in the post-exilic community during the intertestamental period. A town could establish a synagogue if there were at least ten men. In normative Judaism of the NT period, the OT scripture was read and discussed in the synagogue by the men who were present. (See the Mishnah, <i>m. Megillah</i> 3-4; <i>m. Berakhot</i> 2.) First came the law, then the prophets, then someone was asked to speak on the texts. Jesus undoubtedly took the opportunity on this occasion to speak about his person and mission, and its relationship to Old Testament fulfillment. <br>
 <a name="fn36" href="mar.htm#fnB36"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:22)  <i>Grk</i> "They."<br>
 <a name="fn37" href="mar.htm#fnB37"><sup>38</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:22)  Jesus' teaching impressed the hearers with the directness of its claim; he taught with<i> authority</i>. A study of Jewish rabbinic interpretation shows that it was typical to cite a list of authorities to make one's point. Apparently Jesus addressed the issues in terms of his own understanding.<br>
 <a name="fn38" href="mar.htm#fnB38"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:22)  Or "their scribes." The traditional rendering of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">grammateuv"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">grammateu"</FONT>) as "scribe" does not communicate much to the modern English reader, for whom the term might mean "professional copyist," if it means anything at all. The people referred to here were recognized experts in the law of Moses and in traditional laws and regulations. Thus "expert in the law" comes closer to the meaning for the modern reader.<br>
 <a name="fn39" href="mar.htm#fnB39"><sup>40</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:23)  <i>Unclean spirit </i>refers to an evil spirit.<br>

 <a name="fn41" href="mar.htm#fnB41"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:24)  <i>Grk </i><b>"</b>What to us and to you?" This is an idiom meaning, "We have nothing to do with one another," or "Why bother us!" The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tiv hJmi'n kaiV soiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ti Jhmin kai soi</FONT>) is Semitic in origin, though it made its way into colloquial Greek (BAGD 217 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejgwv</FONT>). The equivalent Hebrew expression in the OT had two basic meanings: (1) When one person was unjustly bothering another, the injured party could say "What to me and to you?" meaning, "What have I done to you that you should do this to me?" (Judg 11:12, 2 Chr 35:21, 1 Kgs 17:18). (2) When someone was asked to get involved in a matter he felt was no business of his own, he could say to the one asking him, "What to me and to you?" meaning, "That is your business, how am I involved?" (2 Kgs 3:13, Hos 14:8). Option (1) implies hostility, while option (2) merely implies disengagement. BAGD suggests the following as glosses for this expression: <i>What have I to do with you? What have we in common? Never mind! Leave me alone! </i>Hostility between Jesus and the demons is certainly to be understood in this context, hence the translation: "Leave me alone...." For a very similar expression see Lk 8:28 and (in a different context) John 2:4.<br>
 <a name="fn42" href="mar.htm#fnB42"><sup>43</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:24)  The confession of Jesus as <i>the Holy One</i> here is significant, coming from an unclean spirit. Jesus, as the Holy One of God, who bears God's Spirit and is the expression of holiness, comes to deal with uncleanness and unholiness.<br>

It is more difficult to account for a change from "moved with compassion" to "moved with anger" than it is for a copyist to soften "moved with anger" to "moved with compassion," making the decision difficult. B. M. Metzger (<i>Textual Commentary</i>, 63) suggests that "moved with anger" could have been prompted by 1:43, "Jesus sent the man away with a very strong warning." It also could have been prompted by the man's seeming doubt about Jesus' desire to heal him (v. 40). In view of the diverse MSS supporting "moved with compassion," it is best to adopt it as the original reading.<br>

The loaves were placed on a table in the holy place of the tabernacle, on the north side opposite the lampstand (Exod 26:35). It was the duty of the priest each Sabbath to place fresh bread on the table; the loaves from the previous week were then given to Aaron and his descendants, who ate them in the holy place, because they were considered sacred (Lev 24:9).

 <b>sn</b> (3:13)  The expression <i>up the mountain</i> here may be idiomatic or generic, much like the English "he went to the hospital" (cf. 15:29), or even intentionally reminiscent of Exod 24:12 (LXX), since the genre of the Sermon on the Mount seems to be that of a new Moses giving a new law.<br>

It is possible that the Alexandrian witnesses have inserted these words to bring the text in line with Luke 6:13 (B. M. Metzger, <i>Textual Commentary</i>, 69). But the majority of the MSS that omit "whom he named apostles" here <i>also</i> omit the words "he appointed twelve" in v. 16 (A C<sup>2 </sup>D L <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Q</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Euml;</FONT><sup>1</sup> 33 2427 <i>Byz </i>lat syr bo). It is possible, given in this close range of two verses, that a scribe's eye could skip down to "he appointed twelve" in v. 16 and cause him to miss the words "whom he named apostles" in v. 14. Another factor which might increase this likelihood is the presence of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajpostolouv"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">apostolous</FONT>, "apostles") here and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajpostellh/'</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">apostellh</FONT>, "he could send") in the next verse. The text would still read sensibly if a MS omitted both "whom he named apostles" in v. 14 and "he appointed twelve" in v. 16.

It is probably Mark's intention in this structure to show that Jesus' family is to be regarded as not altogether unlike the experts in the law [scribes] in their perception of the true identity of Jesus; they are incorrect in their understanding of him as well. The tone is obviously one of sadness and the emphasis on Jesus' true family in vv. 31-35 serves to underscore the comparison between his relatives and the scribes on the one hand, and those who truly obey God on the other. <br>

 <a name="fn174" href="mar.htm#fnB174"><sup>43</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:23)  Jesus spoke two <i>parables</i> to demonstrate the absurdity of the thinking of the religious leaders who maintained that he was in league with Satan and that he actually derived his power from the devil. The first parable (vv. 23-26) teaches that if Jesus cast out demons by the ruler of the demons, then in reality Satan is fighting against himself, with the result that his kingdom has come to an end. The second parable (v. 28) about tying up a strong man proves that Jesus does not need to align himself with the devil because Jesus is more powerful. Jesus defeated Satan at his temptation (1:12-13) and by his exorcisms he clearly demonstrated himself to be stronger than the devil. The passage reveals the desperate condition of the religious leaders, who in their hatred for Jesus end up attributing the work of the Holy Spirit to Satan (a position for which they will be held accountable, 3:29-30). For an explanation of what a parable is, see the note on <i>parables</i> in 4:2.<br>
 <a name="fn175" href="mar.htm#fnB175"><sup>44</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:24)  The three conditional statements in vv. 24-26 express the logical result of the assumption that Jesus heals by Satan's power, expressed by the religious leaders.

Three things must be kept in mind: (1) the nature of the sin is to ascribe what is the obvious work of the Holy Spirit (e.g., releasing people from Satan's power) to Satan himself; (2) it is not simply a momentary doubt or sinful attitude, but is indeed a settled condition which opposes the Spirit's work, as typified by the religious leaders who opposed Jesus; and (3) a person who is concerned about it has probably never committed this sin, for those who commit it here (i.e., the religious leaders) are not in the least concerned about Jesus' warning.

In general, parables usually advance a single idea, though there may be many parts and characters in a single parable and subordinate ideas may expand the main idea further. The beauty of using the parable as a teaching device is that it draws the listener into the story, elicits an evaluation, and demands a response.<br>

Sowing would occur in late fall or early winter (October to December) in the rainy season, looking for sprouting in April or May and a June harvest. The use of seed as a figure for God's giving life has OT roots (Isa 55:10-11). The point of the parable of the sower is to illustrate the various responses to the message of the kingdom of God (cf. 4:11).<br>

Jesus seems to be explaining how current events develop old promises, since the NT consistently links the events of Jesus' ministry and message with old promises (Rom 1:1-4; Heb 1:1-2). The traditional translation of this word, "mystery," is misleading to the modern English reader because it suggests a secret which people have tried to uncover but which they have failed to understand (L&amp;N 28.77).<br>

All these miracles demonstrate Jesus' right to proclaim the kingdom message and his sovereign authority over forces, directly or indirectly, hostile to the kingdom.

The equivalent Hebrew expression in the OT had two basic meanings: (1) When one person was unjustly bothering another, the injured party could say "What to me and to you?" meaning, "What have I done to you that you should do this to me?" (Judg 11:12, 2 Chr 35:21, 1 Kgs 17:18). (2) When someone was asked to get involved in a matter he felt was no business of his own, he could say to the one asking him, "What to me and to you?" meaning, "That is your business, how am I involved?" (2 Kgs 3:13, Hos 14:8). These nuances were apparently expanded in Greek, but the basic notions of defensive hostility (option 1) and indifference or disengagement (option 2) are still present. BAGD suggests the following as glosses for this expression: <i>What have I to do with you? What have we in common? Never mind!

It is hard to know which reading is best because there are such weighty MSS on both sides (though "keep" has the stronger external testimony). What makes "keep" suspect, however, is that it appears in two different forms, suggesting independent alterations of a difficult reading. Further, scribes may have been influenced by the preceding "commandment of God" to change the text towards "keep" (B. M. Metzger, <i>Textual Commentary</i>, 81). Thus, the more difficult reading is "set up." Also, the more natural opposite of "reject" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajqei'te</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">aqeite</FONT>], literally "you set aside") is "set up."

What is interesting is that after each passion prediction, Mark records both the misunderstanding of the disciples and then Jesus' teaching on the nature of his death and what genuine discipleship is all about: (1) denying oneself (8:34-38); (2) humility and serving (9:33-37); (3) suffering, humble service and not lording it over people (10:35-45).

The reference to <i>after six days</i> in 9:2 seems to indicate that Mark had the transfiguration in mind insofar as it was a substantial prefiguring of the consummation of the kingdom (although this interpretation is not without its problems). As such, the transfiguration was a tremendous confirmation to the disciples that even though Jesus had just finished speaking of his death (8:31; 9:31; 10:33), he was nonetheless the promised Messiah and things were proceeding according to God's plan.<br>

This transformation means the righteous will share the glory of God. One recalls the way Moses shared the Lord's glory after his visit to the mountain in Exod 34. So the disciples saw Jesus <i>transfigured</i>, and they were getting a sneak preview of the great glory that Jesus would have (only his glory is more inherent to him as one who shares in the rule of the kingdom).<br>

Codex Bezae (D) and the Itala read, "Every sacrifice will be salted with salt." The majority of other MSS (A C Q Y 2427 <i>Byz </i>lat syr<sup>p,h </sup>bo<sup>pt</sup>) have both readings, "Everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be salted with salt." A very early Western scribe may have written the LXX text of Lev 2:13 ("Every sacrifice offering of yours shall be salted with salt") in the margin of his MS. The longer reading may be the result of the conflation of the Alexandrian reading "salted with fire" and the Western reading "salted with salt." The reading adopted by the text enjoys the best support and explains the other readings in the MSS tradition. <br>
 <b>sn</b> (9:49)  The statement <i>everyone will be salted with fire</i> is difficult to interpret. It may be a reference to (1) unbelievers who enter hell as punishment for rejection of Jesus, indicating that just as salt preserves so they will be preserved in their punishment in hell forever; (2) Christians who experience suffering in this world because of their attachment to Christ; (3) any person who experiences suffering in a way appropriate to their relationship to Jesus. For believers this means the suffering of purification, and for unbelievers it means hell, i.e., eternal torment. <br>
 <a name="fn498" href="mar.htm#fnB498"><sup>67</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:50)  <i>Salt</i> was used as seasoning, fertilizer, or as a preservative (BAGD 35 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">a{la"</FONT> 1). If salt ceased to be useful, it was thrown away. With this illustration Jesus warned about a disciple who ceased to follow him.<br>
 <a name="fn499" href="mar.htm#fnB499"><sup>68</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:50)  The difficulty of this saying is understanding how <i>salt </i>could lose <i>its saltiness </i>since its chemical properties cannot change. It is thus often assumed that Jesus was referring to chemically impure salt, perhaps a natural salt which, when exposed to the elements, had all the genuine salt leached out, leaving only the sediment or impurities behind. Others have suggested the background of the saying is the use of salt blocks by Arab bakers to line the floor of their ovens: under the intense heat these blocks would eventually crystallize and undergo a change in chemical composition, finally being thrown out as unserviceable. A saying in the Talmud (<i>b. Bekhorot </i>8b) attributed to R. Joshua ben Chananja (c. A.D. 90), when asked the question "When salt loses its flavor, how can it be made salty again?" is said to have replied, "By salting it with the afterbirth of a mule." He was then asked, "Then does the mule (being sterile) bear young?" to which he replied: "Can salt lose its flavor?" The point appears to be both are impossible. The saying, while admittedly late, suggests that culturally the loss of flavor by salt was regarded as an impossibility. Genuine salt can never lose its flavor. In this case the saying by Jesus here may be similar to Matt 19:24, where it is likewise impossible for the camel to go through the eye of a sewing needle.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (10:2)  The question of the Pharisees was anything but sincere; they were asking it <i>to test him</i>.

Mark's inclusion of the statement <i>And if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery</i> (v. 12) reflects more the problem of the predominantly Gentile church in Rome to which he was writing. As such it may be an interpretive and parenthetical comment by the author rather than part of the saying by Jesus, which would stop at the end of v. 11. As such it should then be placed in parentheses. Further NT passages that deal with the issue of divorce and remarriage are Matt 5:31-32; 19:1-12; Luke 16:18; 1 Cor 7.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (10:17)  <i>Mark 10:17-31. </i>The following unit, Mark 10:17-31, can be divided up into three related sections: (1) the rich man's question (vv. 17-22); (2) Jesus' teaching on riches and the kingdom of God (vv. 23-27), and (3) Peter's statement and Jesus' answer (vv. 28-31).<i> </i>They are all tied together around the larger theme of the relationship of wealth to the kingdom Jesus had been preaching. The point is that it is impossible to attain to the kingdom by means of riches. The passage as a whole is found in the section 8:27-10:52 in which Mark has been focusing on Jesus' suffering and true discipleship. In vv. 28-31 Jesus does not deny great rewards to those who follow him, both in the present age and in the age to come, but it must be thoroughly understood that suffering will be integral to the mission of the disciples and the church, for in the very next section (10:32-34) Jesus reaffirmed the truth about his coming rejection, suffering, death and resurrection. <br>

A modern equivalent, "throwing dice," was chosen here because of its association with gambling. According to L&amp;N 6.219 a term for "dice" is particularly appropriate.<br>
 <a name="fn876" href="mar.htm#fnB876"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:25)  <i>Grk</i> "It was the third hour." This time would have been approximate, and could refer to the beginning of the process, some time before Jesus was lifted on the cross.<br>
 <a name="fn877" href="mar.htm#fnB877"><sup>42</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:26)  Mention of the<i> inscription</i> is an important detail, because the inscription would normally give the reason for the execution. It shows that Jesus was executed for claiming to be a king. It was also probably written with irony from the executioners' point of view.<br>
 <a name="fn878" href="mar.htm#fnB878"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tc</b> (15:27)  Some later MSS add <b>15:28</b> "And the scripture was fulfilled that says, `He was counted with the lawless ones.'"

The addition of the verse with its quotation from Isa 53:12 probably represents a scribal assimilation from Luke 22:37. It was almost certainly not an original part of Mark's Gospel. The present translation follows the standard critical Greek texts in omitting the verse number, a procedure also followed by a number of other modern translations.<br>
 <a name="fn879" href="mar.htm#fnB879"><sup>44</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:30)  There is rich irony in the statement of those who were passing by, "<i>Save yourself and come down from the cross!</i>" In summary, they wanted Jesus to come down from the cross and save his physical life, but it was indeed his staying on the cross and giving his physical life that led to the fact that they could experience a resurrection from death to life. There is a similar kind of irony in the statement made by the chief priests and experts in the law in 15:31. <br>
 <a name="fn880" href="mar.htm#fnB880"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:31)  Or "with the scribes." See the note on the phrase "experts in the law" in 1:22. Only "chief priests" is in the nominative case; this sentence structure attempts to capture this emphasis.<br>

 <a name="fn883" href="mar.htm#fnB883"><sup>48</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:32)  Mark's wording suggests that both of the criminals <i>spoke abusively to him. </i>If so, one of them quickly changed his attitude toward Jesus (see Luke 23:40-43).<br>

 <a name="fn888" href="mar.htm#fnB888"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:34)  The repetition of the phrase "three o'clock" preserves the author's rougher, less elegant style (cf. Mt 27:45-46, Lk 23:44). Although such stylistic matters are frequently handled differently in the translation, because the issue of synoptic literary dependence is involved here, it was considered important to reflect some of the stylistic differences among the synoptics in the translation, so that the English reader can be aware of them.<br>

 <a name="fn890" href="mar.htm#fnB890"><sup>55</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:35)  Perhaps the crowd thought Jesus was <i>calling for Elijah</i> because the exclamation "my God, my God" (i.e., in Aramaic, <i>Eloi</i>, <i>Eloi</i>) sounds like the name Elijah.<br>
 <a name="fn891" href="mar.htm#fnB891"><sup>56</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:36)  <i>Sour wine </i>refers to cheap wine that was called in Latin <i>posca</i>, a cheap vinegar wine diluted heavily with water.

It could refer to the curtain separating the holy of holies from the holy place (Josephus, <i>J. W. </i>5.5.5 [5.219]), or it could refer to one at the entrance of the temple court (Josephus, <i>J. W.</i> 5.5.4 [5.212]). Many argue that the inner curtain is meant because another term, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kavlumma</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kalumma</FONT>), is also used for the outer curtain. Others see a reference to the outer curtain as more likely because of the public nature of this sign. Either way, the symbolism means that access to God has been opened up. It also pictures a judgment that includes the sacrifices.<br>
 <a name="fn894" href="mar.htm#fnB894"><sup>59</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:39)  A <i>centurion</i> was a noncommissioned officer in the Roman army or one of the auxiliary territorial armies, commanding a <i>centuria</i> of (nominally) 100 men. The responsibilities of centurions were broadly similar to modern junior officers, but there was a wide gap in social status between them and officers, and relatively few were promoted beyond the rank of senior centurion. The Roman troops stationed in Judea were auxiliaries, who would normally be rewarded with Roman citizenship after 25 years of service. Some of the centurions may have served originally in the Roman legions (regular army) and thus gained their citizenship at enlistment. Others may have inherited it, like Paul.<br>

 <a name="fn903" href="mar.htm#fnB903"><sup>68</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:43)  Asking<i> for the body of Jesus</i> was indeed a bold move on the part of Joseph of Arimathea, for it clearly and openly identified him with a man who had just been condemned and executed, namely, Jesus. His faith is exemplary, especially for someone who was a member of the council that handed Jesus over for crucifixion (cf. Luke 23:51). He did this because he sought to give Jesus an honorable burial.<br>

 <a name="fn921" href="mar.htm#fnB921"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tc</b> (16:8)  The Gospel of Mark ends at this point in some texts (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> B 304 <i>al</i>), including two of the most respected MSS (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> B). The following shorter ending is found in some MSS: "They reported briefly to those around Peter all that they had been commanded. After these things Jesus himself sent out through them, from the east to the west, the holy and imperishable preaching of eternal salvation. Amen." This shorter ending is often included with the longer ending (L <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Y</FONT> 099 0112 <i>al</i>). Most MSS include the longer ending after v. 8 (A C D K W [following a different shorter ending] <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">D Q P</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Y</FONT> 099 0112 <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Euml;</FONT><sup>13</sup> 28 33 <i>Byz al</i>); however, Jerome only knew of a few Greek MSS that had this ending. This strongly suggests that as time went on scribes added this ending, either for the richness of its material or because of the abruptness of the ending at v. 8. Internal evidence strongly suggests the secondary nature of both the short and the long endings. Their vocabulary and style are decidedly non-Markan (for further details, see B. M. Metzger, <i>Textual Commentary</i>, 102-106). Because of questions about the authenticity of these alternative endings, 16:8 is usually regarded as the last verse of the Gospel of Mark. There are three possible explanations for Mark ending at 16:8: (1) The author intentionally ended the Gospel here in an open-ended fashion; (2) the Gospel was never finished; or (3) the last leaf of the MS was lost prior to copying. This first explanation is the most likely due to several factors, including (a) the probability that the Gospel was originally written on a scroll rather than a codex (only on a codex would the last leaf get lost prior to copying); (b) the unlikelihood of the MS not being completed; and (c) the literary power of ending the Gospel so abruptly that the readers are now drawn into the story itself. That is, they must now ask, "What will I do with Jesus? If I do not accept him in his suffering, I will not see him in his glory."<br>
 <b>sn </b> (16:8) Double brackets have been placed around this passage to indicate that most likely it was not part of the original text of the Gospel of Mark. In spite of this, the passage has an important role in the history of the transmission of the text, so it has been included in the translation.<br>
