 <b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Grk</i> "Paul." The word "from" is not in the Greek text, but has been supplied to indicate the sender of the letter.<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="tit.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  Traditionally, "servant" or "bondservant." Though <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dou'lo"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">doulos</FONT>) is normally translated "servant," the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BAGD notes that "`servant' for `slave' is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times...in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished" (BAGD 205 s.v.). The most accurate translation is "bondservant" (sometimes found in the ASV for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dou'lo"</FONT>), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:1)  Undoubtedly the background for the concept of being the Lord's slave or servant is to be found in the Old Testament scriptures. For a Jew this concept did not connote drudgery, but honor and privilege. It was used of national Israel at times (Isa 43:10), but was especially associated with famous OT personalities, including such great men as Moses (Joshua 14:7), David (Ps 89:3; cf. 2 Sam 7:5, 8) and Elijah (2 Kings 10:10); all these men were "servants (or slaves) of the Lord."<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="tit.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Grk</i> "for the faith," possibly, "in accordance with the faith."<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="tit.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  <i>Grk</i> "before eternal ages."<br>
 <a name="fn4" href="tit.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  The Greek text emphasizes the contrast between vv. 2b and 3a: God promised this long ago but now has revealed it in his own time.<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="tit.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:5)  The imperfect <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajpevleipon</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">apeleipon</FONT>) is read by A C F G 088 0240 33 1175 <i>et pauci</i>, while the aorist <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajpevlipon </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">apelipon</FONT>) is found in <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT>*<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek"> </FONT>D* <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Y </FONT>81 1739 <i>et pauci.</i> The imperfect thus enjoys fairly representative evidence within the Alexandrian and Western traditions. At the same time, the reading of these witnesses could be a simple itacistic change as may be suggested by a third and fourth reading (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">katevlipon </FONT>[<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">katelipon</FONT>] in <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT><sup>2 </sup>D<sup>2 </sup><i>Byz et alii</i>; <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">katevleipon </FONT>[<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kateleipon</FONT>] in L P <i>et alii</i>). Intrinsically, it should be noted that Paul nowhere uses the imperfect of -<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">leipw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">-leipw</FONT>) verbs, though he does use the present participle on occasion. But a scribe would tend to change such forms to the aorist, to conform to Paul's normal style. As well, in this context the aorist fits nicely, while the imperfect seems a bit awkward (especially with its internal perspective). Hence, the imperfect has a slightly greater probability of being original. <br>
 <a name="fn6" href="tit.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  <i>Grk</i> "if anyone is blameless..." as a continuation of v. 5b, beginning to describe the elder's character.<br>
 <a name="fn7" href="tit.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  Or "married only once," "devoted solely to his wife." See the note on "wife" in 1 Tim 3:2; also 1 Tim 3:12; 5:9.<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="tit.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  Or "believing children." The phrase could be translated "believing children," but the parallel with 1 Tim 3:4 ("keeping his children in control") argues for the sense given in the translation.<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="tit.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:7)  The<i> overseer</i> is another term for the same official position of leadership as the "elder." This is seen in the interchange of the two terms in this passage and in Acts 20:17, 28, as well as in the parallels between these verses and 1 Tim 3:1-7.<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="tit.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  <i>Grk</i> "as God's steward."<br>
 <a name="fn11" href="tit.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  <i>Grk</i> "the faithful message in accordance with the teaching" (referring to apostolic teaching).<br>

 <a name="fn13" href="tit.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:10)  The earliest and best MSS omit <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kai</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>) after <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">polloi </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">polloi</FONT>; so <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> A C P 088 81 104 <i>et alii</i>), though the conjunction is found in several significant witnesses, chiefly of the Western and Byzantine texts (D F G I <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Y</FONT> 33 1739 1881 <i>Byz</i> lat). Although it is quite possible that some scribes omitted the word, thinking it was superfluous, it is also possible that others added the conjunction for clarification. Judging by the pedigree of the witnesses and the inconclusiveness of the internal evidence, the shorter reading is considered to be most likely original. <br>
 <a name="fn14" href="tit.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:10)  Before <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">peritomh'"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">peritomhs</FONT>), several important MSS add the article (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> C D* I 33 81 1739 <i>et alii</i>). The shorter reading is supported by fairly strong support as well, though chiefly of the Western and Byzantine texts (A D<sup>2 </sup>F G <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Y</FONT> <i>Byz</i>). Since shorter readings are generally uncharacteristic of the Byzantine text, and since such here is backed by a few decent witnesses (especially A F G), it is most probably original. Translation is not likely to be affected either way.<br>
 <b>tn</b> (1:10)  <i>Grk</i> "those of the circumcision."<br>
 <a name="fn15" href="tit.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:12)  A saying attributed to the poet Epimenides of Crete (6th century B.C.).<br>

 <a name="fn17" href="tit.htm#fnB17"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:1)  <i>Grk</i> "say what is fitting for sound teaching" (introducing the behavior called for in this chapter.).<br>

 <a name="fn19" href="tit.htm#fnB19"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:2)  <i>Temperate...in endurance. </i>See the same cluster of virtues in 1 Thess 1:3 and 1 Cor 13:13.<br>
 <a name="fn20" href="tit.htm#fnB20"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tc</b> (2:4)  The indicative (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">swfronivzousin</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">swfronizousin</FONT>) after <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{na</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jina</FONT>) is unclassical; and though it is found in Koine Greek, it is not common. Every instance of such is changed to a subjunctive in the NT MSS (always or almost always by the Byzantine scribes). Thus, it is clearly the harder reading. Such a harder reading becomes virtually certain as original when it is found in early Alexandrian witnesses, for these are prone (so it is assumed) to correct grammar (thus they would be prone to change the indicative to the subjunctive <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">swfronivzwsin</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">swfronizwsin</FONT>). In this instance, the indicative is read by <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT>* A F G H P <i>et alii</i>, a significant number of Alexandrian and Western witnesses. There can be little doubt that this is the original wording.<br>
 <b>tn</b> (2:4)  <i>Grk</i> "that they may train" (continuing the sentence of 2:3). <br>
 <a name="fn21" href="tit.htm#fnB21"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  This verb, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">swfronivzw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">swfronizw</FONT>), denotes teaching in the sense of bringing people to their senses, showing what sound thinking is.<br>

 <a name="fn30" href="tit.htm#fnB30"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:10)  Or "showing that genuine faith is productive." At issue between these two translations is the force of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajgaqhvn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">agaqhn</FONT>): is it attributive (as the text has it) or predicate (as in this note)? A number of considerations point in the direction of a predicate <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajgaqhvn</FONT> (e.g., separation from the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pivstin</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">pistin</FONT>) by the verb, the possibility that the construction is an object-complement, etc.), though is not usually seen as an option in either translations or commentaries. Cf. D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax</i>, 188-89, 312-13, for a discussion. Contextually, it makes an intriguing statement, for it suggests a synthetic or synonymous parallel: "`Slaves should be wholly subject to their masters...demonstrating that all [genuine] faith is productive, with the result [ecbatic <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{na</FONT>] that they will completely adorn the doctrine of God.' The point of the text, then, if this understanding is correct, is an exhortation to slaves to demonstrate that their faith is sincere and results in holy behavior. If taken this way, the text seems to support the idea that saving faith does not fail, but even results in good works" (Wallace, 312-13). The translation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajgaqhvn</FONT> as an attributive adjective, however, also makes good sense.<br>
 <a name="fn31" href="tit.htm#fnB31"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:10)  Or "adorn," "show the beauty of."<br>
 <a name="fn32" href="tit.htm#fnB32"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:11)  <i>Grk</i> "all men"; but <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajnqrwvpoi"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">anqrwpois</FONT>) is generic here, referring to both men and women.<br>
 <a name="fn33" href="tit.htm#fnB33"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:12)  <i>Grk</i> "training us" (as a continuation of the previous clause). Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started at the beginning of v. 12 by translating the participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">paideuvousa</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">paideuousa</FONT>) as a finite verb and supplying the pronoun "it" as subject.<br>
 <a name="fn34" href="tit.htm#fnB34"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:12)  <i>Grk</i> "ungodliness."<br>
 <a name="fn35" href="tit.htm#fnB35"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:13)  <i>Grk</i> "the blessed hope and glorious appearing."<br>
 <a name="fn36" href="tit.htm#fnB36"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:13)  The terms "God and Savior" both refer to the same person, Jesus Christ. This is one of the clearest statements in the NT concerning the deity of Christ. The construction in Greek is known as the Granville Sharp rule, named after the English philanthropist-linguist who first clearly articulated the rule in 1798. Sharp pointed out that in the construction article-noun-<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT>-noun (where <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv </FONT>[<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>] = "and"), when two nouns are singular, personal, and common (i.e., not proper names), they <i>always</i> had the same referent. Illustrations such as "the friend and brother," "the God and Father," etc. abound in the NT to prove Sharp's point. The only issue is whether terms such as "God" and "Savior" could be considered common nouns as opposed to proper names. Sharp and others who followed (such as T. F. Middleton in his masterful <i>The Doctrine of the Greek Article</i>) demonstrated that a proper name in Greek was one that could not be pluralized. Since both "God" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">qeos</FONT>) and "savior" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">swthvr</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">swthr</FONT>) were occasionally found in the plural, they did not constitute proper names, and hence, do fit Sharp's rule. Although there have been 200 years of attempts to dislodge Sharp's rule, all attempts have been futile. Sharp's rule stands vindicated after all the dust has settled. For more information on Sharp's rule see D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax,</i> 270-78, esp. 276. See also 2 Pet 1:1 and Jude 4.<br>
