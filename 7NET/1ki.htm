<p><A NAME="1"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> King David was very old;<a name="fnB0" href="1ki_note.htm#fn0"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> even when they covered him with blankets,<a name="fnB1" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> he could not get warm. 
<bqverse 2>2  His servants advised<a name="fnB2" href="1ki_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> him, "A young virgin must be found for our master, the king,<a name="fnB3" href="1ki_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> to take care of the king's needs<a name="fnB4" href="1ki_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and serve as his nurse. She can also sleep with you<a name="fnB5" href="1ki_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> and keep our master, the king, warm."<a name="fnB6" href="1ki_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  So they looked through all Israel<a name="fnB7" href="1ki_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> for a beautiful young woman and found Abishag, a Shunammite, and brought her to the king. 
<bqverse 4>4  The young woman was very beautiful; she became the king's nurse and served him, but the king did not have sex with her.<a name="fnB8" href="1ki_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 5>5  Now Adonijah son of Haggith<a name="fnB9" href="1ki_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> was promoting himself,<a name="fnB10" href="1ki_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> boasting,<a name="fnB11" href="1ki_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> "I will be king!" He managed to acquire<a name="fnB12" href="1ki_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> chariots and horsemen, as well as fifty men to serve as his royal guard.<a name="fnB13" href="1ki_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  (Now his father had never corrected<a name="fnB14" href="1ki_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> him<a name="fnB15" href="1ki_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> by saying, "Why do you do such things?" He was also very handsome and had been born right after Absalom.<a name="fnB16" href="1ki_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a>) 
<bqverse 7>7  He collaborated<a name="fnB17" href="1ki_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they supported<a name="fnB18" href="1ki_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> him.<a name="fnB19" href="1ki_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David's elite warriors<a name="fnB20" href="1ki_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> did not ally<a name="fnB21" href="1ki_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> with Adonijah. 
<bqverse 9>9  Adonijah sacrificed sheep, cattle, and fattened steers at the Stone of Zoheleth near En Rogel. He invited all his brothers, the king's sons,<a name="fnB22" href="1ki_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> as well as all the men of Judah, the king's servants. 
<bqverse 10>10  But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the elite warriors,<a name="fnB23" href="1ki_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> or his brother Solomon.<p>

<bqverse 11>11  Nathan said to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, "Has it been reported to you<a name="fnB24" href="1ki_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> that Adonijah son of Haggith has become king behind our master David's back?<a name="fnB25" href="1ki_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  Now<a name="fnB26" href="1ki_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> let me give you some advice as to how<a name="fnB27" href="1ki_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> you can save your life and your son Solomon's life. 
<bqverse 13>13  Visit<a name="fnB28" href="1ki_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> King David and say to him, `My master, O king, did you not solemnly promise<a name="fnB29" href="1ki_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> your servant, "Surely your son Solomon will be king after me; he will sit on my throne"? So why has Adonijah become king?' 
<bqverse 14>14  While<a name="fnB30" href="1ki_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> you are still there speaking to the king, I will arrive<a name="fnB31" href="1ki_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> and verify your report."<a name="fnB32" href="1ki_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 15>15  So Bathsheba visited the king in his private quarters.<a name="fnB33" href="1ki_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> (The king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was serving the king.) 
<bqverse 16>16  Bathsheba bowed down on the floor before<a name="fnB34" href="1ki_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> the king. The king said, "What do you want?" 
<bqverse 17>17  She replied to him, "My master, you swore an oath to your servant by the LORD your God, `Solomon your son will be king after me and he will sit on my throne.' 
<bqverse 18>18  But now, look, Adonijah has become king! But you,<a name="fnB35" href="1ki_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> my master the king, are not even aware of it!<a name="fnB36" href="1ki_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  He has sacrificed many cattle, steers, and sheep and has invited all the king's sons, Abiathar the priest, and Joab, the commander of the army, but he has not invited your servant Solomon. 
<bqverse 20>20  Now,<a name="fnB37" href="1ki_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> my master, O king, all Israel is watching anxiously to see who is named to succeed my master the king on the throne.<a name="fnB38" href="1ki_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  If a decision is not made,<a name="fnB39" href="1ki_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> when my master the king is buried with his ancestors,<a name="fnB40" href="1ki_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> my son Solomon and I<a name="fnB41" href="1ki_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> will be considered state criminals."<a name="fnB42" href="1ki_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 22>22  Just then,<a name="fnB43" href="1ki_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> while she was still speaking to the king, Nathan the prophet arrived. 
<bqverse 23>23  The king was told, "Nathan the prophet is here." Nathan entered and bowed before the king with his face to the floor.<a name="fnB44" href="1ki_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  Nathan said, "My master, O king, did you announce, `Adonijah will be king after me; he will sit on my throne'? 
<bqverse 25>25  For today he has gone down and sacrificed many cattle, steers, and sheep and has invited all the king's sons, the army commanders, and Abiathar the priest. At this moment<a name="fnB45" href="1ki_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> they are having a feast<a name="fnB46" href="1ki_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> in his presence, and they have declared, `Long live King Adonijah!'<a name="fnB47" href="1ki_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  But he did not invite me--your servant--or Zadok the priest, or Benaiah son of Jehoiada, or your servant Solomon. 
<bqverse 27>27  Has my master the king authorized this without informing your servants<a name="fnB48" href="1ki_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> who should succeed my master the king on his throne?"<a name="fnB49" href="1ki_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494011958"></a></p>
<p><i>David Picks Solomon as His Successor</i>
<p>
<bqverse 28>28  King David responded,<a name="fnB50" href="1ki_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> "Summon Bathsheba!"<a name="fnB51" href="1ki_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> She came and stood before the king.<a name="fnB52" href="1ki_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 29>29  The king swore an oath: "As certainly as the LORD lives (he who has rescued me<a name="fnB53" href="1ki_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> from every danger), 
<bqverse 30>30  I will keep<a name="fnB54" href="1ki_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> today the oath I swore to you by the LORD God of Israel: `Surely Solomon your son will be king after me; he will sit in my place on my throne.'" 
<bqverse 31>31  Bathsheba bowed down to the king with her face to the floor<a name="fnB55" href="1ki_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> and said, "May my master, King David, live forever!"<p>

<bqverse 32>32  King David said, "Summon Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet,<a name="fnB56" href="1ki_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> and Benaiah son of Jehoiada." They came before the king, 
<bqverse 33>33  and he<a name="fnB57" href="1ki_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> told them, "Take your master's<a name="fnB58" href="1ki_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> servants with you, put my son Solomon on my mule, and lead him down to Gihon.<a name="fnB59" href="1ki_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 34>34  There Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet will anoint<a name="fnB60" href="1ki_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> him king over Israel; then blow the trumpet and declare, `Long live King Solomon!' 
<bqverse 35>35  Then follow him up as he comes and sits on my throne. He will be king in my place; I have decreed<a name="fnB61" href="1ki_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> that he will be ruler over Israel and Judah." 
<bqverse 36>36  Benaiah son of Jehoiada responded<a name="fnB62" href="1ki_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> to the king: "So be it!<a name="fnB63" href="1ki_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> May the LORD God of my master the king confirm it!<a name="fnB64" href="1ki_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 37>37  As the LORD is with my master the king, so may he be with Solomon, and may he make him an even greater king than my master King David!"<a name="fnB65" href="1ki_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 38>38  So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites, and the Pelethites<a name="fnB66" href="1ki_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> went down, put Solomon on King David's mule, and led him to Gihon. 
<bqverse 39>39  Zadok the priest took a horn filled with oil<a name="fnB67" href="1ki_note.htm#fn67"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a> from the tent and poured it on<a name="fnB68" href="1ki_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>69</SUP></FONT></a> Solomon; the trumpet was blown and all the people declared, "Long live King Solomon!" 
<bqverse 40>40  All the people followed him up, playing flutes and celebrating so loudly they made the ground shake.<a name="fnB69" href="1ki_note.htm#fn69"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>70</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 41>41  Now Adonijah and all his guests heard the commotion just as they had finished eating.<a name="fnB70" href="1ki_note.htm#fn70"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>71</SUP></FONT></a> When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he asked, "Why is there such a noisy commotion in the city?"<a name="fnB71" href="1ki_note.htm#fn71"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>72</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 42>42  As he was still speaking, <a name="fnB72" href="1ki_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>73</SUP></FONT></a>Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. Adonijah said, "Come in, for<a name="fnB73" href="1ki_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>74</SUP></FONT></a> an important man like you must be bringing good news."<a name="fnB74" href="1ki_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>75</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 43>43  Jonathan replied<a name="fnB75" href="1ki_note.htm#fn75"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>76</SUP></FONT></a> to Adonijah: "No!<a name="fnB76" href="1ki_note.htm#fn76"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>77</SUP></FONT></a> Our master<a name="fnB77" href="1ki_note.htm#fn77"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>78</SUP></FONT></a> King David has made Solomon king. 
<bqverse 44>44  The king sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites, and the Pelethites and they put him on the king's mule. 
<bqverse 45>45  Then Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anointed<a name="fnB78" href="1ki_note.htm#fn78"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>79</SUP></FONT></a> him king in Gihon. They went up from there rejoicing, and the city is in a commotion. That is the sound you hear. 
<bqverse 46>46  Furthermore, Solomon has assumed the royal throne.<a name="fnB79" href="1ki_note.htm#fn79"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>80</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 47>47  The king's servants have even come to congratulate<a name="fnB80" href="1ki_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>81</SUP></FONT></a> our master<a name="fnB81" href="1ki_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>82</SUP></FONT></a> King David, saying, `May your God<a name="fnB82" href="1ki_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>83</SUP></FONT></a> make Solomon more famous than you and make him an even greater king than you!'<a name="fnB83" href="1ki_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>84</SUP></FONT></a> Then the king leaned<a name="fnB84" href="1ki_note.htm#fn84"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>85</SUP></FONT></a> on the bed 
<bqverse 48>48  and said<a name="fnB85" href="1ki_note.htm#fn85"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>86</SUP></FONT></a> this, `The LORD God of Israel is worthy of praise because<a name="fnB86" href="1ki_note.htm#fn86"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>87</SUP></FONT></a> today he has placed a successor on my throne and allowed me to see it.'"<a name="fnB87" href="1ki_note.htm#fn87"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>88</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 49>49  All of Adonijah's guests panicked;<a name="fnB88" href="1ki_note.htm#fn88"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>89</SUP></FONT></a> they got up and went their separate ways. 
<bqverse 50>50  Adonijah feared Solomon, so he got up and went and grabbed hold of the horns of the altar.<a name="fnB89" href="1ki_note.htm#fn89"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>90</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 51>51  Solomon was told, "Look, Adonijah fears you;<a name="fnB90" href="1ki_note.htm#fn90"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>91</SUP></FONT></a> look, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, `May King Solomon solemnly promise<a name="fnB91" href="1ki_note.htm#fn91"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>92</SUP></FONT></a> me today that he will not kill his servant with the sword.'" 
<bqverse 52>52  Solomon said, "If he is a loyal subject,<a name="fnB92" href="1ki_note.htm#fn92"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>93</SUP></FONT></a> not a hair of his head will be harmed, but if he is found to be a traitor,<a name="fnB93" href="1ki_note.htm#fn93"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>94</SUP></FONT></a> he will die." 
<bqverse 53>53  King Solomon sent men to bring him down<a name="fnB94" href="1ki_note.htm#fn94"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>95</SUP></FONT></a> from the altar. He came and bowed down to King Solomon, and Solomon told him, "Go home."<a name="fnB95" href="1ki_note.htm#fn95"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>96</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 1>1 </b> When David was close to death,<a name="fnB96" href="1ki_note.htm#fn96"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> he told<a name="fnB97" href="1ki_note.htm#fn97"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> Solomon his son:

<bqverse 8>8  "Note well, you still have to contend with Shimei son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim,<a name="fnB117" href="1ki_note.htm#fn117"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> who tried to call down upon me a horrible judgment when I went to Mahanaim.<a name="fnB118" href="1ki_note.htm#fn118"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> He came down and met me at the Jordan, and I solemnly promised<a name="fnB119" href="1ki_note.htm#fn119"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> him by the LORD, `I will not strike you down<a name="fnB120" href="1ki_note.htm#fn120"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> with the sword.'

<bqverse 10>10  Then David passed away<a name="fnB124" href="1ki_note.htm#fn124"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> and was buried in the city of David.<a name="fnB125" href="1ki_note.htm#fn125"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  David reigned over Israel forty years; he reigned in Hebron seven years, and in Jerusalem thirty-three years. <a name="_Toc494011960"></a></p>
<p><i>Solomon Secures the Throne</i>
<p>
<bqverse 12>12  Solomon sat on his father David's throne, and his royal authority<a name="fnB126" href="1ki_note.htm#fn126"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> was firmly solidified.<p>

<bqverse 13>13  Adonijah son of Haggith visited Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. She asked, "Do you come in peace?" He answered, "Yes."<a name="fnB127" href="1ki_note.htm#fn127"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  He added,<a name="fnB128" href="1ki_note.htm#fn128"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> "I have something to say to you." She replied, "Speak." 
<bqverse 15>15  He said, "You know that the kingdom<a name="fnB129" href="1ki_note.htm#fn129"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> was mine and all Israel considered me king.<a name="fnB130" href="1ki_note.htm#fn130"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> But then the kingdom was given to my brother, for the LORD decided it should be his.<a name="fnB131" href="1ki_note.htm#fn131"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  Now I'd like to ask you for just one thing. Please don't refuse me."<a name="fnB132" href="1ki_note.htm#fn132"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> She said, "Go ahead and ask."<a name="fnB133" href="1ki_note.htm#fn133"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  He said, "Please ask King Solomon if he would give me Abishag the Shunammite as a wife, for he won't refuse you."<a name="fnB134" href="1ki_note.htm#fn134"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  Bathsheba replied, "That's fine,<a name="fnB135" href="1ki_note.htm#fn135"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> I'll speak to the king on your behalf."<p>

<bqverse 19>19  So Bathsheba visited King Solomon to speak to him on Adonijah's behalf. The king got up to greet<a name="fnB136" href="1ki_note.htm#fn136"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> her, bowed to her, and then sat on his throne. He ordered a throne to be brought for the king's mother,<a name="fnB137" href="1ki_note.htm#fn137"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> and she sat at his right hand. 
<bqverse 20>20  She said, "I'd like to ask you for just one small favor.<a name="fnB138" href="1ki_note.htm#fn138"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> Please don't refuse me."<a name="fnB139" href="1ki_note.htm#fn139"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> He said,<a name="fnB140" href="1ki_note.htm#fn140"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> "Go ahead and ask, my mother, for I wouldn't refuse you." 
<bqverse 21>21  She said, "Allow Abishag the Shunammite to be given to your brother Adonijah as a wife." 
<bqverse 22>22  King Solomon answered his mother, "Why just request Abishag the Shunammite for him?<a name="fnB141" href="1ki_note.htm#fn141"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> Since he is my older brother, you should also request the kingdom for him, for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab son of Zeruiah!"<p>

<bqverse 23>23  King Solomon then swore an oath by the LORD, "May God judge me severely,<a name="fnB142" href="1ki_note.htm#fn142"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> if Adonijah does not pay for this request with his life!<a name="fnB143" href="1ki_note.htm#fn143"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  Now, as certainly as the LORD lives (he who made me secure, allowed me to sit on my father David's throne, and established a dynasty<a name="fnB144" href="1ki_note.htm#fn144"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> for me as he promised), Adonijah will be executed today!" 
<bqverse 25>25  King Solomon then sent<a name="fnB145" href="1ki_note.htm#fn145"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he killed Adonijah.<a name="fnB146" href="1ki_note.htm#fn146"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 26>26  The king then told Abiathar the priest, "Go back to your property<a name="fnB147" href="1ki_note.htm#fn147"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> in Anathoth. You deserve to die,<a name="fnB148" href="1ki_note.htm#fn148"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> but today I will not kill you because you did carry the ark of the Sovereign LORD before my father David and you suffered with my father through all his difficult times."<a name="fnB149" href="1ki_note.htm#fn149"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  Solomon dismissed Abiathar from his position as priest of the LORD,<a name="fnB150" href="1ki_note.htm#fn150"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> fulfilling the decree of judgment the LORD made in Shiloh against the family of Eli.<a name="fnB151" href="1ki_note.htm#fn151"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 28>28  When the news reached Joab (for Joab had supported<a name="fnB152" href="1ki_note.htm#fn152"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> Adonijah, but he had not supported Absalom), he<a name="fnB153" href="1ki_note.htm#fn153"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> ran to the tent of the LORD and grabbed hold of the horns of the altar.<a name="fnB154" href="1ki_note.htm#fn154"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 29>29  When King Solomon heard<a name="fnB155" href="1ki_note.htm#fn155"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> that Joab had run to the tent of the LORD and was right there beside the altar, he ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada,<a name="fnB156" href="1ki_note.htm#fn156"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> "Go, strike him down." 
<bqverse 30>30  When Benaiah arrived at the tent of the LORD, he said to him, "The king says, `Come out!'" But he replied, "No, I will die here." So Benaiah sent word to the king and reported Joab's reply.<a name="fnB157" href="1ki_note.htm#fn157"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 31>31  The king told him, "Do as he said. Strike him down and bury him. Take away from me and from my father's family<a name="fnB158" href="1ki_note.htm#fn158"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> the guilt of Joab's murderous, bloody deeds.<a name="fnB159" href="1ki_note.htm#fn159"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 32>32  May the LORD punish him for the blood he shed;<a name="fnB160" href="1ki_note.htm#fn160"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> behind my father David's back he struck down and murdered with the sword two men who were more innocent and morally upright than he<a name="fnB161" href="1ki_note.htm#fn161"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a>--Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel's army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah's army. 
<bqverse 33>33  May Joab and his descendants be perpetually guilty of their shed blood, but may the LORD give perpetual peace to David, his descendants, his family,<a name="fnB162" href="1ki_note.htm#fn162"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> and his dynasty."<a name="fnB163" href="1ki_note.htm#fn163"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 34>34  So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and executed Joab;<a name="fnB164" href="1ki_note.htm#fn164"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>69</SUP></FONT></a> he was buried at his home in the wilderness. 
<bqverse 35>35  The king appointed Benaiah son of Jehoida to take his place at the head of<a name="fnB165" href="1ki_note.htm#fn165"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>70</SUP></FONT></a> the army, and the king appointed Zadok the priest to take Abiathar's place.<a name="fnB166" href="1ki_note.htm#fn166"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>71</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 36>36  Next the king summoned<a name="fnB167" href="1ki_note.htm#fn167"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>72</SUP></FONT></a> Shimei and told him, "Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there--but you may not leave there to go anywhere!<a name="fnB168" href="1ki_note.htm#fn168"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>73</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 37>37  If you ever do leave and cross the Kidron Valley, know for sure that you will certainly die! You will be responsible for your own death."<a name="fnB169" href="1ki_note.htm#fn169"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>74</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 38>38  Shimei said to the king, "My master the king's proposal is acceptable.<a name="fnB170" href="1ki_note.htm#fn170"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>75</SUP></FONT></a> Your servant will do as you say."<a name="fnB171" href="1ki_note.htm#fn171"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>76</SUP></FONT></a> So Shimei lived in Jerusalem for a long time.<a name="fnB172" href="1ki_note.htm#fn172"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>77</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 39>39  Three years later two of Shimei's servants ran away to King Achish son of Maacah of Gath. Shimei was told, "Look, your servants are in Gath." 
<bqverse 40>40  So Shimei got up, saddled his donkey, and went to Achish at Gath to find his servants; Shimei went and brought back his servants from Gath. 
<bqverse 41>41  When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had then returned, 
<bqverse 42>42  the king summoned<a name="fnB173" href="1ki_note.htm#fn173"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>78</SUP></FONT></a> Shimei and said to him, "You will recall<a name="fnB174" href="1ki_note.htm#fn174"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>79</SUP></FONT></a> that I made you take an oath by the LORD, and I solemnly warned you, `If you ever leave and go anywhere,<a name="fnB175" href="1ki_note.htm#fn175"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>80</SUP></FONT></a> know for sure that you will certainly die.' You said to me, `The proposal is acceptable; I agree to it.'<a name="fnB176" href="1ki_note.htm#fn176"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>81</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 43>43  Why then have you broken the oath you made before the LORD and disobeyed the order I gave you?"<a name="fnB177" href="1ki_note.htm#fn177"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>82</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 44>44  Then the king said to Shimei, "You are well aware of the way you mistreated my father David.<a name="fnB178" href="1ki_note.htm#fn178"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>83</SUP></FONT></a> The LORD will punish you for what you did.<a name="fnB179" href="1ki_note.htm#fn179"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>84</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 45>45  But King Solomon will be empowered<a name="fnB180" href="1ki_note.htm#fn180"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>85</SUP></FONT></a> and David's dynasty<a name="fnB181" href="1ki_note.htm#fn181"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>86</SUP></FONT></a> will endure permanently before the LORD." 
<bqverse 46>46  The king then gave the order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada who went and executed Shimei.<a name="fnB182" href="1ki_note.htm#fn182"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>87</SUP></FONT></a><p>
So Solomon took firm control of the kingdom.<a name="fnB183" href="1ki_note.htm#fn183"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>88</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>The LORD Gives Solomon Wisdom</i>
<p><A NAME="3"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Solomon made an alliance by marriage with Pharaoh, king of Egypt; he married Pharaoh's daughter. He brought her to the City of David<a name="fnB184" href="1ki_note.htm#fn184"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> until he could finish building his residence and the temple of the LORD and the wall around Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 2>2  Now the people were offering sacrifices at the high places,<a name="fnB185" href="1ki_note.htm#fn185"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> because in those days a temple had not yet been built to honor the LORD.<a name="fnB186" href="1ki_note.htm#fn186"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  Solomon demonstrated his loyalty to the LORD by following<a name="fnB187" href="1ki_note.htm#fn187"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> the practices<a name="fnB188" href="1ki_note.htm#fn188"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> of his father David, except that he offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places.<p>

<bqverse 4>4  The king went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices, for it had the most prominent of the high places.<a name="fnB189" href="1ki_note.htm#fn189"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> Solomon would offer up<a name="fnB190" href="1ki_note.htm#fn190"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> a thousand burnt sacrifices on the altar there. 
<bqverse 5>5  One night in Gibeon the LORD appeared<a name="fnB191" href="1ki_note.htm#fn191"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> to Solomon in a dream. God said, "Tell<a name="fnB192" href="1ki_note.htm#fn192"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> me what I should give you." 
<bqverse 6>6  Solomon replied, "You demonstrated<a name="fnB193" href="1ki_note.htm#fn193"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> great loyalty to your servant, my father David, as he served<a name="fnB194" href="1ki_note.htm#fn194"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> you faithfully, properly, and sincerely.<a name="fnB195" href="1ki_note.htm#fn195"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> You have maintained this great loyalty to this day by allowing his son to sit on his throne.<a name="fnB196" href="1ki_note.htm#fn196"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  Now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king in my father David's place, even though I am only a young man and am inexperienced.<a name="fnB197" href="1ki_note.htm#fn197"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 9>9  So give your servant a discerning mind<a name="fnB200" href="1ki_note.htm#fn200"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> so he can make judicial decisions for<a name="fnB201" href="1ki_note.htm#fn201"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> your people and distinguish right from wrong.<a name="fnB202" href="1ki_note.htm#fn202"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> Otherwise<a name="fnB203" href="1ki_note.htm#fn203"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> no one is able<a name="fnB204" href="1ki_note.htm#fn204"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> to make judicial decisions for<a name="fnB205" href="1ki_note.htm#fn205"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> this great nation of yours."<a name="fnB206" href="1ki_note.htm#fn206"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  The Lord<a name="fnB207" href="1ki_note.htm#fn207"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> was pleased that Solomon made this request.<a name="fnB208" href="1ki_note.htm#fn208"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  God said to him, "Because you asked for the ability to make wise judicial decisions, and not for long life, or riches, or vengeance on your enemies,<a name="fnB209" href="1ki_note.htm#fn209"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  I<a name="fnB210" href="1ki_note.htm#fn210"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> grant your request,<a name="fnB211" href="1ki_note.htm#fn211"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> and give<a name="fnB212" href="1ki_note.htm#fn212"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> you a wise and discerning mind<a name="fnB213" href="1ki_note.htm#fn213"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> superior to that of anyone who has preceded or will succeed you.<a name="fnB214" href="1ki_note.htm#fn214"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  Furthermore, I am giving<a name="fnB215" href="1ki_note.htm#fn215"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> you what you did not request-- riches and honor so that you will be the greatest king of your generation.<a name="fnB216" href="1ki_note.htm#fn216"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  If you follow my instructions<a name="fnB217" href="1ki_note.htm#fn217"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> by obeying<a name="fnB218" href="1ki_note.htm#fn218"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> my rules and regulations, just as your father David did,<a name="fnB219" href="1ki_note.htm#fn219"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> then I will grant you long life."<a name="fnB220" href="1ki_note.htm#fn220"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  Solomon then woke up and realized it was a dream.<a name="fnB221" href="1ki_note.htm#fn221"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> He went to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the Lord's covenant, offered up burnt sacrifices, presented tokens of peace,<a name="fnB222" href="1ki_note.htm#fn222"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> and held a feast for all his servants.<a name="_Toc494011962"></a></p>
<p><i>Solomon Demonstrates His Wisdom</i>

<bqverse 16>16  Then two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him. 
<bqverse 17>17  One of the women said, "My master, this woman and I live in the same house. I had a baby while she was with me in the house. 
<bqverse 18>18  Then three days after I had my baby, this woman also had a baby. We were alone; there was no one else in the house except the two of us.<a name="fnB223" href="1ki_note.htm#fn223"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  This woman's child suffocated<a name="fnB224" href="1ki_note.htm#fn224"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> during the night when she rolled<a name="fnB225" href="1ki_note.htm#fn225"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> on top of him. 
<bqverse 20>20  She got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side, while your servant was sleeping. She put him in her arms, and put her dead son in my arms. 
<bqverse 21>21  I got up in the morning to nurse my son, and there he was,<a name="fnB226" href="1ki_note.htm#fn226"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> dead! But when I examined him carefully in the morning, I realized it was not my baby."<a name="fnB227" href="1ki_note.htm#fn227"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  The other woman said, "No! My son is alive; your son is dead!" But the first woman replied, "No, your son is dead; my son is alive." Each presented her case before the king.<a name="fnB228" href="1ki_note.htm#fn228"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 23>23  The king said, "One says, `My son is alive; your son is dead,' while the other says, `No, your son is dead; my son is alive.'" 
<bqverse 24>24  The king ordered, "Get me a sword!" So they placed a sword before the king. 
<bqverse 25>25  The king then said, "Cut the living child in two, and give half to one and half to the other! 
<bqverse 26>26  The real mother<a name="fnB229" href="1ki_note.htm#fn229"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> spoke up to the king, for her motherly instincts were aroused.<a name="fnB230" href="1ki_note.htm#fn230"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> She said, "My master, give her the living child! Whatever you do, don't kill him!"<a name="fnB231" href="1ki_note.htm#fn231"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> But the other woman said, "Neither one of us will have him! Let them cut him in two!" 
<bqverse 27>27  The king responded, "Give the first woman the living child; don't kill him. She is the mother." 
<bqverse 28>28  When all Israel heard about the judicial decision which the king had rendered, they respected<a name="fnB232" href="1ki_note.htm#fn232"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> the king, for they realized<a name="fnB233" href="1ki_note.htm#fn233"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> that he possessed supernatural wisdom<a name="fnB234" href="1ki_note.htm#fn234"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> to make judicial decisions.

<p><i>Solomon's Wealth and Fame</i>
<p>
<bqverse 20>20  The people of Judah and Israel were as innumerable as the sand on the seashore; they had plenty to eat and drink and were happy. 
<bqverse 21>21 <i>(5.1)</i><a name="fnB241" href="1ki_note.htm#fn241"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> Solomon ruled all the kingdoms from the Euphrates River<a name="fnB242" href="1ki_note.htm#fn242"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. These kingdoms paid tribute as Solomon's subjects throughout his lifetime.<a name="fnB243" href="1ki_note.htm#fn243"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  Each day Solomon's royal court consumed<a name="fnB244" href="1ki_note.htm#fn244"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> thirty cors<a name="fnB245" href="1ki_note.htm#fn245"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> of finely milled flour, sixty cors of cereal,

<bqverse 24>24  His royal court was so large because<a name="fnB247" href="1ki_note.htm#fn247"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> he ruled over all the kingdoms west of the Euphrates River from Tiphsah<a name="fnB248" href="1ki_note.htm#fn248"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> to Gaza; he was at peace with all his neighbors.<a name="fnB249" href="1ki_note.htm#fn249"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  All the people of Judah and Israel had security; everyone from Dan to Beersheba enjoyed the produce of their vines and fig trees throughout Solomon's lifetime.<a name="fnB250" href="1ki_note.htm#fn250"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 29>29  God gave Solomon wisdom and very great discernment; the breadth of his understanding<a name="fnB254" href="1ki_note.htm#fn254"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> was as infinite as the sand on the seashore.

<bqverse 31>31  He was wiser than any man, including Ethan the Ezrahite or Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. He was famous in all the neighboring nations.<a name="fnB256" href="1ki_note.htm#fn256"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Solomon Gathers Building Materials for the Temple</i>
<p><A NAME="5"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b><i>(5.15)</i><a name="fnB261" href="1ki_note.htm#fn261"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a><b> </b>King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers<a name="fnB262" href="1ki_note.htm#fn262"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> to Solomon when he heard that he had been anointed king in his father's place. (Hiram had always been an ally of David.) 
<bqverse 2>2  Solomon then sent this message to Hiram: 
<bqverse 3>3  "You know that my father David was unable to build a temple to honor the LORD<a name="fnB263" href="1ki_note.htm#fn263"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> his God, for he was busy fighting battles on all fronts while the LORD subdued his enemies.<a name="fnB264" href="1ki_note.htm#fn264"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  But now the LORD my God has made me secure on all fronts; there is no adversary or dangerous threat. 
<bqverse 5>5  So I have decided<a name="fnB265" href="1ki_note.htm#fn265"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> to build a temple to honor the LORD<a name="fnB266" href="1ki_note.htm#fn266"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> my God, as the LORD instructed my father David, `Your son, whom I will put on your throne in your place, is the one who will build a temple to honor me.'<a name="fnB267" href="1ki_note.htm#fn267"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  So now order some cedars of Lebanon to be cut for me. My servants will work with your servants. I will pay your servants whatever you say is appropriate, for you know that we have no one among us who knows how to cut down trees like the Sidonians."<p>

<bqverse 7>7  When Hiram heard Solomon's message, he was very happy. He said, "The LORD is worthy of praise today because he<a name="fnB268" href="1ki_note.htm#fn268"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> has given David a wise son to rule over this great nation." 
<bqverse 8>8  Hiram then sent this message to Solomon: "I received<a name="fnB269" href="1ki_note.htm#fn269"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> the message you sent to me. I will give you all the cedars and evergreens you need.<a name="fnB270" href="1ki_note.htm#fn270"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  My servants will bring the timber down from Lebanon to the sea. I will send it by sea in raft-like bundles to the place you designate.<a name="fnB271" href="1ki_note.htm#fn271"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> There I will separate the logs<a name="fnB272" href="1ki_note.htm#fn272"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> and you can carry them away. In exchange you will supply the food I need for my royal court."<a name="fnB273" href="1ki_note.htm#fn273"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 10>10  So Hiram supplied the cedars and evergreens Solomon needed,<a name="fnB274" href="1ki_note.htm#fn274"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  and Solomon supplied Hiram annually with twenty thousand cors<a name="fnB275" href="1ki_note.htm#fn275"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> of wheat as provision for his royal court,<a name="fnB276" href="1ki_note.htm#fn276"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> as well as twenty thousand baths<a name="fnB277" href="1ki_note.htm#fn277"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> of pure<a name="fnB278" href="1ki_note.htm#fn278"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> olive oil.<a name="fnB279" href="1ki_note.htm#fn279"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  So the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he had promised him. And Hiram and Solomon were at peace and made a treaty.<a name="fnB280" href="1ki_note.htm#fn280"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 13>13  King Solomon conscripted<a name="fnB281" href="1ki_note.htm#fn281"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> work crews<a name="fnB282" href="1ki_note.htm#fn282"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> from throughout Israel, thirty thousand men in all. 
<bqverse 14>14  He sent them to Lebanon in shifts of ten thousand men per month. They worked in Lebanon for one month, and then spent two months at home. Adoniram was supervisor of<a name="fnB283" href="1ki_note.htm#fn283"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> the work crews. 
<bqverse 15>15  Solomon also had seventy thousand common laborers<a name="fnB284" href="1ki_note.htm#fn284"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> and eighty thousand stonemasons<a name="fnB285" href="1ki_note.htm#fn285"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> in the hills, 
<bqverse 16>16  besides thirty-three hundred<a name="fnB286" href="1ki_note.htm#fn286"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> officials who supervised the workers.<a name="fnB287" href="1ki_note.htm#fn287"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  By royal order<a name="fnB288" href="1ki_note.htm#fn288"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> they supplied large valuable stones in order to build the temple's foundation with chiseled stone. 
<bqverse 18>18  Solomon's and Hiram's construction workers,<a name="fnB289" href="1ki_note.htm#fn289"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> along with men from Byblos,<a name="fnB290" href="1ki_note.htm#fn290"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> did the chiseling and prepared the wood and stones for the building of the temple.<a name="fnB291" href="1ki_note.htm#fn291"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>The Building of the Temple</i>
<p><A NAME="6"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> In the four hundred and eightieth year after the Israelites left Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, during the month Ziv<a name="fnB292" href="1ki_note.htm#fn292"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> (the second month), he began building the LORD's temple. 
<bqverse 2>2  The temple King Solomon built for the LORD was ninety feet<a name="fnB293" href="1ki_note.htm#fn293"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> long, thirty feet<a name="fnB294" href="1ki_note.htm#fn294"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> wide, and forty-five feet<a name="fnB295" href="1ki_note.htm#fn295"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> high. 
<bqverse 3>3  The porch in front of the main hall of the temple was thirty feet<a name="fnB296" href="1ki_note.htm#fn296"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> long, corresponding to the width of the temple. It was fifteen feet<a name="fnB297" href="1ki_note.htm#fn297"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> wide, extending out from the front of the temple. 
<bqverse 4>4  He made framed windows for the temple. 
<bqverse 5>5  He built an extension all around the walls of the temple's main hall and holy place and constructed side rooms in it.<a name="fnB298" href="1ki_note.htm#fn298"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  The bottom floor of the extension was seven-and-a-half feet<a name="fnB299" href="1ki_note.htm#fn299"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> wide; the middle floor nine feet<a name="fnB300" href="1ki_note.htm#fn300"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> wide, and the third floor ten-and-a-half<a name="fnB301" href="1ki_note.htm#fn301"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> feet wide. He made niches<a name="fnB302" href="1ki_note.htm#fn302"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> on the temple's outer walls so the beams would not have to be inserted into the walls.<a name="fnB303" href="1ki_note.htm#fn303"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  As the temple was being built, only stones shaped at the quarry<a name="fnB304" href="1ki_note.htm#fn304"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> were used; the sound of hammers, pickaxes, or any other iron tool was not heard at the temple while it was being built. 
<bqverse 8>8  The entrance to the bottom<a name="fnB305" href="1ki_note.htm#fn305"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> level of side rooms was on the south side of the temple; stairs went up<a name="fnB306" href="1ki_note.htm#fn306"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> to the middle floor and then on up to the third<a name="fnB307" href="1ki_note.htm#fn307"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> floor. 
<bqverse 9>9  He finished building the temple<a name="fnB308" href="1ki_note.htm#fn308"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> and covered it<a name="fnB309" href="1ki_note.htm#fn309"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> with rafters<a name="fnB310" href="1ki_note.htm#fn310"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> and boards made of cedar.<a name="fnB311" href="1ki_note.htm#fn311"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  He built an extension all around the temple; it was seven-and-a-half feet high<a name="fnB312" href="1ki_note.htm#fn312"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> and it was attached to the temple by cedar beams.<p>

<bqverse 11>11 <a name="fnB313" href="1ki_note.htm#fn313"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> The LORD said<a name="fnB314" href="1ki_note.htm#fn314"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> to Solomon: 
<bqverse 12>12  "As for this temple you are building, if you follow<a name="fnB315" href="1ki_note.htm#fn315"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> my rules, observe<a name="fnB316" href="1ki_note.htm#fn316"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> my regulations, and obey all my commandments,<a name="fnB317" href="1ki_note.htm#fn317"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> I will fulfill through you the promise I made to your father David.<a name="fnB318" href="1ki_note.htm#fn318"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  I will live among the Israelites and will not abandon my people Israel."<p>

<bqverse 14>14  So Solomon finished building the temple.<a name="fnB319" href="1ki_note.htm#fn319"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  He constructed the walls inside the temple with cedar planks; he paneled the inside with wood from the floor of the temple to the rafters<a name="fnB320" href="1ki_note.htm#fn320"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> of the ceiling. He covered the temple floor with boards made from the wood of evergreens. 
<bqverse 16>16  Thirty feet in from the rear of the temple he built a wall as a partition for an inner sanctuary that would be the most holy place.<a name="fnB321" href="1ki_note.htm#fn321"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> He paneled the wall with cedar planks from the floor to the rafters.<a name="fnB322" href="1ki_note.htm#fn322"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  The main hall in front of the inner sanctuary was sixty feet long.<a name="fnB323" href="1ki_note.htm#fn323"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  The inside of the temple was all cedar and was adorned with carvings of round ornaments and of flowers in bloom. Everything was cedar; no stones were visible.<a name="fnB324" href="1ki_note.htm#fn324"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 19>19  He prepared the inner sanctuary inside the temple so that the ark of the covenant of the LORD might be placed there. 
<bqverse 20>20  The inner sanctuary was thirty feet<a name="fnB325" href="1ki_note.htm#fn325"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> long, thirty feet wide, and thirty feet high. He plated it with gold,<a name="fnB326" href="1ki_note.htm#fn326"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> as well as the cedar altar.<a name="fnB327" href="1ki_note.htm#fn327"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  Solomon plated the inside of the temple with gold.<a name="fnB328" href="1ki_note.htm#fn328"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> He hung golden chains in front of the inner sanctuary and plated the inner sanctuary<a name="fnB329" href="1ki_note.htm#fn329"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> with gold. 
<bqverse 22>22  He plated the entire inside of the temple with gold, as well as the altar inside the inner sanctuary.<a name="fnB330" href="1ki_note.htm#fn330"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 23>23  In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubs of olive wood; each stood fifteen feet<a name="fnB331" href="1ki_note.htm#fn331"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> high. 
<bqverse 24>24  Each of the first cherub's wings was seven-and-a-half feet long; its entire wingspan was fifteen feet.<a name="fnB332" href="1ki_note.htm#fn332"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  The second cherub also had a wingspan of fifteen feet; it was identical to the first in measurements and shape.<a name="fnB333" href="1ki_note.htm#fn333"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  Each cherub stood fifteen feet high.<a name="fnB334" href="1ki_note.htm#fn334"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  He put the cherubs in the inner sanctuary of the temple.<a name="fnB335" href="1ki_note.htm#fn335"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> Their wings were spread out. One of the first cherub's wings touched one wall and one of the other cherub's wings touched the opposite wall.

<bqverse 28>28  He plated the cherubs with gold.<p>

<bqverse 29>29  On all the walls around the temple, inside and out,<a name="fnB337" href="1ki_note.htm#fn337"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> he carved<a name="fnB338" href="1ki_note.htm#fn338"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> cherubs, palm trees, and flowers in bloom. 
<bqverse 30>30  He plated the floor of the temple with gold, inside and out.<a name="fnB339" href="1ki_note.htm#fn339"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 31>31  He made doors of olive wood at the entrance to the inner sanctuary; the pillar on each doorpost was five-sided.<a name="fnB340" href="1ki_note.htm#fn340"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 32>32  On the two doors made of olive wood he carved<a name="fnB341" href="1ki_note.htm#fn341"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> cherubs, palm trees, and flowers in bloom, and he plated them with gold.<a name="fnB342" href="1ki_note.htm#fn342"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> He plated the cherubs and the palm trees with hammered gold.<a name="fnB343" href="1ki_note.htm#fn343"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 33>33  In the same way he made doorposts of olive wood for the entrance to the main hall, only with four sided pillars.<a name="fnB344" href="1ki_note.htm#fn344"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 34>34  He also made<a name="fnB345" href="1ki_note.htm#fn345"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> two doors out of wood from evergreens; each door had two folding leaves.<a name="fnB346" href="1ki_note.htm#fn346"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 35>35  He carved cherubs, palm trees, and flowers in bloom and plated them with gold, leveled out over the carvings. 
<bqverse 36>36  He built the inner courtyard with three rows of chiseled stones and a row of cedar beams.<p>

<bqverse 37>37  In the month Ziv<a name="fnB347" href="1ki_note.htm#fn347"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> of the fourth year of Solomon's reign<a name="fnB348" href="1ki_note.htm#fn348"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> the foundation was laid for the LORD's temple. 
<bqverse 38>38  In the eleventh year, in the month Bul<a name="fnB349" href="1ki_note.htm#fn349"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> (the eighth month) the temple was completed in accordance with all its specifications and blueprints.

<p><i>Solomon Commissions Hiram to Supply the Temple</i>
<p>
<bqverse 13>13  King Solomon sent for Hiram<a name="fnB378" href="1ki_note.htm#fn378"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> of Tyre. 
<bqverse 14>14  He was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali,<a name="fnB379" href="1ki_note.htm#fn379"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> and his father was a craftsmen in bronze from Tyre. He had the skill and know-how<a name="fnB380" href="1ki_note.htm#fn380"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> to make all kinds of works of bronze. He reported to King Solomon and did all the work he was assigned.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  He fashioned two bronze pillars; each pillar was twenty-seven feet<a name="fnB381" href="1ki_note.htm#fn381"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> high and eighteen feet<a name="fnB382" href="1ki_note.htm#fn382"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> in circumference. 
<bqverse 16>16  He made two bronze tops for the pillars; each was seven-and-a-half feet high.<a name="fnB383" href="1ki_note.htm#fn383"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  The latticework on the tops of the pillars was adorned with ornamental wreaths and chains; the top of each pillar had seven groupings of ornaments.<a name="fnB384" href="1ki_note.htm#fn384"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  When he made the pillars, there were two rows of pomegranate-shaped ornaments around the latticework covering the top of each pillar.<a name="fnB385" href="1ki_note.htm#fn385"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  The tops of the two pillars in the porch were shaped like lilies and were six feet high.<a name="fnB386" href="1ki_note.htm#fn386"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  On the top of each pillar, right above the bulge beside the latticework, there were two hundred pomegranate-shaped ornaments arranged in rows all the way around.<a name="fnB387" href="1ki_note.htm#fn387"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  He set up the pillars on the porch in front of the main hall. He erected one pillar on the right<a name="fnB388" href="1ki_note.htm#fn388"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> side and called it Jakin;<a name="fnB389" href="1ki_note.htm#fn389"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> he erected the other pillar on the left<a name="fnB390" href="1ki_note.htm#fn390"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> side and called it Boaz.<a name="fnB391" href="1ki_note.htm#fn391"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  The tops of the pillars were shaped like lilies. So the construction of the pillars was completed.<p>

<bqverse 23>23  He also made the big bronze basin called "The Sea."<a name="fnB392" href="1ki_note.htm#fn392"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> It measured fifteen feet<a name="fnB393" href="1ki_note.htm#fn393"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> from rim to rim, was circular in shape, and stood seven-and-a-half feet<a name="fnB394" href="1ki_note.htm#fn394"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> high. Its circumference was forty-five feet.<a name="fnB395" href="1ki_note.htm#fn395"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  Under the rim all the way around it<a name="fnB396" href="1ki_note.htm#fn396"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> were round ornaments<a name="fnB397" href="1ki_note.htm#fn397"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> arranged in settings fifteen feet long.<a name="fnB398" href="1ki_note.htm#fn398"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> The ornaments were in two rows and had been cast with "The Sea."<a name="fnB399" href="1ki_note.htm#fn399"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  "The Sea" stood on top of twelve bulls. Three faced northward, three westward, three southward, and three eastward. "The Sea" was placed on top of them, and they all faced outward.<a name="fnB400" href="1ki_note.htm#fn400"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  It was four fingers thick and its rim was like that of a cup shaped like a lily blossom. It could hold about twelve thousand gallons.<a name="fnB401" href="1ki_note.htm#fn401"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 27>27  He also made ten bronze movable stands. Each stand was six feet<a name="fnB402" href="1ki_note.htm#fn402"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> long, six feet<a name="fnB403" href="1ki_note.htm#fn403"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> wide, and four-and-a-half feet<a name="fnB404" href="1ki_note.htm#fn404"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> high. 
<bqverse 28>28  The stands were constructed with frames between the joints. 
<bqverse 29>29  On these frames and joints were ornamental lions, bulls, and cherubs. Under the lions and bulls were decorative wreaths.<a name="fnB405" href="1ki_note.htm#fn405"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 30>30  Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles and four supports. Under the basin the supports were fashioned on each side with wreaths.<a name="fnB406" href="1ki_note.htm#fn406"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 31>31  Inside the stand was a round opening that was a foot-and-a-half deep; it had a support that was two and one-quarter feet long.<a name="fnB407" href="1ki_note.htm#fn407"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> On the edge of the opening were carvings in square frames.<a name="fnB408" href="1ki_note.htm#fn408"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 32>32  The four wheels were under the frames and the crossbars of the axles were connected to the stand. Each wheel was two and one-quarter feet<a name="fnB409" href="1ki_note.htm#fn409"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> high. 
<bqverse 33>33  The wheels were constructed like chariot wheels; their crossbars, rims, spokes, and hubs were made of cast metal. 
<bqverse 34>34  Each stand had four supports, one per side projecting out from the stand.<a name="fnB410" href="1ki_note.htm#fn410"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 35>35  On top of each stand was a round opening three-quarters of a foot deep;<a name="fnB411" href="1ki_note.htm#fn411"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> there were also supports and frames on top of the stands. 
<bqverse 36>36  He engraved ornamental cherubs, lions, and palm trees on the plates of the supports and frames wherever there was room,<a name="fnB412" href="1ki_note.htm#fn412"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> with wreaths<a name="fnB413" href="1ki_note.htm#fn413"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> all around. 
<bqverse 37>37  He made the ten stands in this way. All of them were cast in one mold and were identical in measurements and shape.<p>

<bqverse 38>38  He also made ten bronze basins, each of which could hold about two hundred forty gallons.<a name="fnB414" href="1ki_note.htm#fn414"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> Each basin was six feet in diameter;<a name="fnB415" href="1ki_note.htm#fn415"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> there was one basin for each stand. 
<bqverse 39>39  He put five basins on the south side of the temple and five on the north side. He put "The Sea" on the south side, in the southeast corner. <p>

<bqverse 40>40  Hiram also made basins, shovels, and bowls. He<a name="fnB416" href="1ki_note.htm#fn416"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a> finished all the work on the LORD's temple he had been assigned by King Solomon.<a name="fnB417" href="1ki_note.htm#fn417"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 41>41  He made<a name="fnB418" href="1ki_note.htm#fn418"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a> the two pillars, the two bowl shaped tops of the pillars, the latticework for the bowl shaped tops of the two pillars, 
<bqverse 42>42  the four hundred pomegranate-shaped ornaments for the latticework of the two pillars (each latticework had two rows of these ornaments at the bowl-shaped top of the pillar), 
<bqverse 43>43  the ten movable stands with their ten basins, 
<bqverse 44>44  the big bronze basin called "The Sea" with its twelve bulls underneath,<a name="fnB419" href="1ki_note.htm#fn419"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>69</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 45>45  and the pots, shovels, and bowls. All these items King Solomon assigned Hiram to make for the LORD's temple<a name="fnB420" href="1ki_note.htm#fn420"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>70</SUP></FONT></a> were made from polished bronze. 
<bqverse 46>46  The king had them cast in earth foundries<a name="fnB421" href="1ki_note.htm#fn421"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>71</SUP></FONT></a> in the region of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan. 
<bqverse 47>47  Solomon left all these items unweighed; there were so many of them they did not weigh the bronze.<a name="fnB422" href="1ki_note.htm#fn422"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>72</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 48>48  Solomon also made all these items for the LORD's temple: the gold altar, the gold table on which was kept the bread offered to God,<a name="fnB423" href="1ki_note.htm#fn423"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>73</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 49>49  the pure gold lampstands at the entrance to the inner sanctuary (five on the right and five on the left), the gold flower-shaped ornaments, lamps, and tongs, 
<bqverse 50>50  the pure gold bowls, trimming shears, basins, pans, and censers, and the gold door sockets for the inner sanctuary (the most holy place) and for the doors of the main hall of the temple. 
<bqverse 51>51  When King Solomon was finished constructing the LORD's temple, he<a name="fnB424" href="1ki_note.htm#fn424"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>74</SUP></FONT></a> put the holy items that belonged to his father David (the silver, gold, and other articles) in the treasuries of the LORD's temple.

<bqverse 6>6  The priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its assigned<a name="fnB432" href="1ki_note.htm#fn432"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, in the most holy place under the wings of the cherubs. 
<bqverse 7>7  The cherubs' wings extended over the place where the ark sat; the cherubs overshadowed the ark and its poles.<a name="fnB433" href="1ki_note.htm#fn433"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  The poles were so long their ends were visible from the holy place in front of the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen from beyond that point.<a name="fnB434" href="1ki_note.htm#fn434"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> They have remained there to this very day. 
<bqverse 9>9  There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets Moses had placed there in Horeb.<a name="fnB435" href="1ki_note.htm#fn435"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> It was there that<a name="fnB436" href="1ki_note.htm#fn436"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD made an agreement with the Israelites after he brought them out of the land of Egypt. 
<bqverse 10>10  Once the priests left the holy place, a cloud filled the LORD's temple. 
<bqverse 11>11  The priests could not carry out their duties<a name="fnB437" href="1ki_note.htm#fn437"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> because of the cloud; the LORD's glory filled his temple.<a name="fnB438" href="1ki_note.htm#fn438"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 12>12  Then Solomon said, "The LORD has said that he lives in thick darkness. 
<bqverse 13>13  O LORD,<a name="fnB439" href="1ki_note.htm#fn439"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> truly I have built a lofty temple for you, a place where you can live permanently." 
<bqverse 14>14  Then the king turned around<a name="fnB440" href="1ki_note.htm#fn440"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> and pronounced a blessing over the whole Israelite assembly as they stood there.<a name="fnB441" href="1ki_note.htm#fn441"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  He said, "The LORD God of Israel is worthy of praise because he has fulfilled<a name="fnB442" href="1ki_note.htm#fn442"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> what he promised<a name="fnB443" href="1ki_note.htm#fn443"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> my father David.

<bqverse 17>17  Now my father David had a strong desire<a name="fnB446" href="1ki_note.htm#fn446"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> to build a temple to honor the LORD God of Israel.<a name="fnB447" href="1ki_note.htm#fn447"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  The LORD told my father David, `It is right for you to have a strong desire to build a temple to honor me.<a name="fnB448" href="1ki_note.htm#fn448"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  But you will not build the temple; your very own son will build the temple for my honor.'<a name="fnB449" href="1ki_note.htm#fn449"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  The LORD has kept the promise he made.<a name="fnB450" href="1ki_note.htm#fn450"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> I have taken my father David's place and have occupied the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised.

<bqverse 21>21  and set up in it a place for the ark containing the covenant the LORD made with our ancestors<a name="fnB452" href="1ki_note.htm#fn452"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> when he brought them out of the land of Egypt."<a name="_Toc494011970"></a></p>
<p><i>Solomon Prays for Israel</i>

<bqverse 22>22  Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the entire assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward the sky.<a name="fnB453" href="1ki_note.htm#fn453"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>The LORD Gives Solomon a Promise and a Warning</i>
<p><A NAME="9"><b>

<bqverse 2>2  the LORD appeared to Solomon a second time, in the same way he had appeared to him at Gibeon.<a name="fnB546" href="1ki_note.htm#fn546"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  The LORD said to him, "I have answered<a name="fnB547" href="1ki_note.htm#fn547"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> your prayer and your request for help that you made to me.

<p><i>Foreign Affairs and Building Projects</i>
<p>
<bqverse 10>10  After twenty years, during which Solomon built the LORD's temple and the royal palace,<a name="fnB563" href="1ki_note.htm#fn563"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  King Solomon gave King Hiram of Tyre twenty cities in the region of Galilee, because Hiram had supplied Solomon with cedars, evergreens, and all the gold he wanted. 
<bqverse 12>12  When Hiram went out from Tyre to inspect the cities Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them.<a name="fnB564" href="1ki_note.htm#fn564"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  Hiram asked,<a name="fnB565" href="1ki_note.htm#fn565"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> "Why did you give me these cities, my friend<a name="fnB566" href="1ki_note.htm#fn566"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a>?" He called that area the region of Cabul, a name which it has retained to this day.<a name="fnB567" href="1ki_note.htm#fn567"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  Hiram had sent to the king one hundred twenty units<a name="fnB568" href="1ki_note.htm#fn568"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> of gold.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  Here are the details concerning the work crews<a name="fnB569" href="1ki_note.htm#fn569"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> King Solomon conscripted<a name="fnB570" href="1ki_note.htm#fn570"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> to build the LORD's temple, his palace, the terrace, the wall of Jerusalem, and the cities of<a name="fnB571" href="1ki_note.htm#fn571"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. 
<bqverse 16>16  (Pharaoh, king of Egypt, had attacked and captured Gezer. He burned it and killed the Canaanites who lived in the city. He gave it as a wedding present to his daughter, who had married Solomon.) 
<bqverse 17>17  Solomon built up Gezer, lower Beth Horon, 
<bqverse 18>18  Baalath, Tadmor in the wilderness,<a name="fnB572" href="1ki_note.htm#fn572"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  all the storage cities that belonged to him,<a name="fnB573" href="1ki_note.htm#fn573"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> and the cities where chariots and horses were kept.<a name="fnB574" href="1ki_note.htm#fn574"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> He built whatever he wanted in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and throughout his entire kingdom.<a name="fnB575" href="1ki_note.htm#fn575"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  Now several non-Israelite peoples were left in the land after the conquest of Joshua, including the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.<a name="fnB576" href="1ki_note.htm#fn576"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  Their descendants remained in the land (the Israelites were unable to wipe them out). Solomon conscripted them for his work crews, and they continue in that role to this very day.<a name="fnB577" href="1ki_note.htm#fn577"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  Solomon did not assign Israelites to these work crews;<a name="fnB578" href="1ki_note.htm#fn578"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> the Israelites served as his soldiers, attendants, officers, charioteers, and commanders of his chariot forces.<a name="fnB579" href="1ki_note.htm#fn579"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23  These men were also in charge of Solomon's work projects; there were a total of five hundred fifty men who supervised the workers.<a name="fnB580" href="1ki_note.htm#fn580"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  Solomon built the terrace as soon as Pharaoh's daughter moved up from the city of David<a name="fnB581" href="1ki_note.htm#fn581"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> to the palace Solomon built for her.<a name="fnB582" href="1ki_note.htm#fn582"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 25>25  Three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and tokens of peace on the altar he had built for the LORD, burning incense along with them before the LORD. He made the temple his official worship place.<a name="fnB583" href="1ki_note.htm#fn583"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 26>26  King Solomon also built ships in Ezion Geber, which is located near Elath in the land of Edom, on the shore of the Red Sea. 
<bqverse 27>27  Hiram sent his fleet and some of his sailors, who were well acquainted with the sea, to serve with Solomon's men.<a name="fnB584" href="1ki_note.htm#fn584"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  They sailed<a name="fnB585" href="1ki_note.htm#fn585"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> to Ophir, took from there four hundred twenty units<a name="fnB586" href="1ki_note.htm#fn586"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> of gold, and then brought them to King Solomon.

<p><i>Solomon's Wealth</i>

<bqverse 16>16  King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred measures<a name="fnB615" href="1ki_note.htm#fn615"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> of gold were used for each shield.

<bqverse 18>18  The king made a large throne decorated with ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. 
<bqverse 19>19  There were six steps leading up to the throne, and the back of it was rounded on top. The throne had two armrests with a statue of a lion standing on each side.<a name="fnB618" href="1ki_note.htm#fn618"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 21>21  All of King Solomon's cups were made of gold, and all the household items in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were made of pure gold.

<bqverse 8>8  He built high places for all his foreign wives so they could burn incense and make sacrifices to their gods.<a name="fnB653" href="1ki_note.htm#fn653"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 9>9  The LORD was angry with Solomon because he had shifted his allegiance<a name="fnB654" href="1ki_note.htm#fn654"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> away from the LORD, the  God of Israel, who had appeared to him on two occasions<a name="fnB655" href="1ki_note.htm#fn655"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  and had warned him about this very thing so that he would not follow other gods.<a name="fnB656" href="1ki_note.htm#fn656"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> But he did not obey<a name="fnB657" href="1ki_note.htm#fn657"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD's command. 
<bqverse 11>11  So the LORD said to Solomon, "Because you insist on doing these things and have not kept the covenantal rules I gave you,<a name="fnB658" href="1ki_note.htm#fn658"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> I will surely tear the kingdom away from you and give it to your servant. 
<bqverse 12>12  However, for your father David's sake I will not do this while you are alive. I will tear it away from your son's hand instead. 
<bqverse 13>13  But I will not tear away the entire kingdom; I will leave<a name="fnB659" href="1ki_note.htm#fn659"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> your son one tribe for my servant David's sake and for the sake of my chosen city Jerusalem."<p>

<bqverse 14>14  The LORD brought<a name="fnB660" href="1ki_note.htm#fn660"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> against Solomon an enemy, Hadad the Edomite, a descendant of the Edomite king. 
<bqverse 15>15  During David's campaign against Edom,<a name="fnB661" href="1ki_note.htm#fn661"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> Joab, the commander of the army, while on a mission to bury the dead, killed every male in Edom. 
<bqverse 16>16  For six months Joab and the entire Israelite army<a name="fnB662" href="1ki_note.htm#fn662"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> stayed there until they had exterminated every male in Edom.<a name="fnB663" href="1ki_note.htm#fn663"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  Hadad,<a name="fnB664" href="1ki_note.htm#fn664"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> who was only a small boy at the time, escaped with some of his father's Edomite servants and headed for Egypt.<a name="fnB665" href="1ki_note.htm#fn665"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  They went from Midian to Paran; they took some men from Paran and went to Egypt. Pharaoh, king of Egypt, supplied him with a house and food and even assigned him some land.<a name="fnB666" href="1ki_note.htm#fn666"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  Pharaoh liked Hadad so well<a name="fnB667" href="1ki_note.htm#fn667"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> he gave him his sister-in-law (Queen Tahpenes' sister) as a wife.<a name="fnB668" href="1ki_note.htm#fn668"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  Tahpenes' sister gave<a name="fnB669" href="1ki_note.htm#fn669"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> him a son named Genubath. Tahpenes raised<a name="fnB670" href="1ki_note.htm#fn670"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> him in Pharaoh's palace; Genubath grew up in Pharaoh's palace among Pharaoh's sons. 
<bqverse 21>21  While in Egypt Hadad heard that David had passed away<a name="fnB671" href="1ki_note.htm#fn671"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> and that Joab, the commander of the army, was dead. So Hadad asked Pharaoh, "Give me permission to leave<a name="fnB672" href="1ki_note.htm#fn672"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> so I can return to my homeland." 
<bqverse 22>22  Pharaoh said to him, "What do you lack here that makes you want to go to your homeland?"<a name="fnB673" href="1ki_note.htm#fn673"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> Hadad replied,<a name="fnB674" href="1ki_note.htm#fn674"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> "Nothing, but please give me permission to leave."<a name="fnB675" href="1ki_note.htm#fn675"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 23>23  God also brought against Solomon<a name="fnB676" href="1ki_note.htm#fn676"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> another enemy, Rezon son of Eliada who had run away from his master, King Hadadezer of Zobah. 
<bqverse 24>24  He gathered some men and organized a raiding band.<a name="fnB677" href="1ki_note.htm#fn677"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> When David tried to kill them,<a name="fnB678" href="1ki_note.htm#fn678"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> they went to Damascus, where they settled down and gained control of the city. 
<bqverse 25>25  He was Israel's enemy throughout Solomon's reign and, like Hadad, caused trouble. He loathed<a name="fnB679" href="1ki_note.htm#fn679"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> Israel and ruled over Syria.<p>

<bqverse 26>26  Jeroboam son of Nebat, one of Solomon's servants, rebelled against<a name="fnB680" href="1ki_note.htm#fn680"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> the king. He was an Ephraimite<a name="fnB681" href="1ki_note.htm#fn681"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> from Zeredah whose mother was a widow named Zeruah. 
<bqverse 27>27  This is what prompted him to rebel against the king.<a name="fnB682" href="1ki_note.htm#fn682"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> Solomon built a terrace and he closed up a gap in the wall of the city of his father David.<a name="fnB683" href="1ki_note.htm#fn683"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  Jeroboam was a talented man;<a name="fnB684" href="1ki_note.htm#fn684"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> when Solomon saw that the young man was an accomplished worker, he made him the leader of the work crew from the tribe<a name="fnB685" href="1ki_note.htm#fn685"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> of Joseph. 
<bqverse 29>29  At that time, when Jeroboam had left Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met him on the road; the two of them were alone in the open country. Ahijah<a name="fnB686" href="1ki_note.htm#fn686"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> was wearing a brand new robe, 
<bqverse 30>30  and he grabbed the robe<a name="fnB687" href="1ki_note.htm#fn687"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> and tore it into twelve pieces. 
<bqverse 31>31  Then he told Jeroboam, "Take ten pieces, for this is what the LORD God of Israel says: `Look, I am about to tear the kingdom from Solomon's hand and I will give ten tribes to you. 
<bqverse 32>32  He will retain one tribe, for my servant David's sake and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel. 
<bqverse 33>33  I am taking the kingdom from him<a name="fnB688" href="1ki_note.htm#fn688"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> because they have<a name="fnB689" href="1ki_note.htm#fn689"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> abandoned me and worshiped the Sidonian goddess Astarte, the Moabite god Chemosh, and the Ammonite god Milcom. They have not followed my instructions<a name="fnB690" href="1ki_note.htm#fn690"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> by doing what I approve and obeying my rules and regulations, like Solomon's father David did.<a name="fnB691" href="1ki_note.htm#fn691"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 34>34  I will not take the whole kingdom from his hand. I will allow him to be ruler for the rest of his life for the sake of my chosen servant David who kept my commandments and rules. 
<bqverse 35>35  I will take the kingdom from the hand of his son and give ten tribes to you.<a name="fnB692" href="1ki_note.htm#fn692"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 36>36  I will leave<a name="fnB693" href="1ki_note.htm#fn693"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> his son one tribe so my servant David's dynasty may continue to serve me<a name="fnB694" href="1ki_note.htm#fn694"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> in Jerusalem, the city I have chosen as my home.<a name="fnB695" href="1ki_note.htm#fn695"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 37>37  I will select<a name="fnB696" href="1ki_note.htm#fn696"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> you; you will rule over all you desire to have and you will be king over Israel. 
<bqverse 38>38  You must obey<a name="fnB697" href="1ki_note.htm#fn697"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> all I command you to do, follow my instructions,<a name="fnB698" href="1ki_note.htm#fn698"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> do what I approve,<a name="fnB699" href="1ki_note.htm#fn699"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> and keep my rules and commandments, like my servant David did. Then I will be with you and establish for you a lasting dynasty, as I did for David;<a name="fnB700" href="1ki_note.htm#fn700"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> I will give you Israel. 
<bqverse 39>39  I will humiliate David's descendants because of this,<a name="fnB701" href="1ki_note.htm#fn701"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a> but not forever."<a name="fnB702" href="1ki_note.htm#fn702"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 40>40  Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but Jeroboam escaped to Egypt and found refuge with King Shishak of Egypt.<a name="fnB703" href="1ki_note.htm#fn703"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a> He stayed in Egypt until Solomon died.<a name="_Toc494011977"></a></p>
<p><i>Solomon's Reign Ends</i>
<p>
<bqverse 41>41  The rest of the events of Solomon's reign, including all his accomplishments and his wise decisions, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of Solomon.<a name="fnB704" href="1ki_note.htm#fn704"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>69</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 42>42  Solomon ruled over all Israel from Jerusalem for forty years. 
<bqverse 43>43  Then Solomon passed away<a name="fnB705" href="1ki_note.htm#fn705"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>70</SUP></FONT></a> and was buried in the city of his father David.<a name="fnB706" href="1ki_note.htm#fn706"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>71</SUP></FONT></a> His son Rehoboam replaced him as king.<a name="fnB707" href="1ki_note.htm#fn707"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>72</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqchapter 12>
<a name="_Toc494011978"></a></p>
<p><i>Rehoboam Loses His Kingdom</i>
<p><A NAME="12"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Rehoboam traveled to Shechem, for all Israel had gathered in<a name="fnB708" href="1ki_note.htm#fn708"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> Shechem to make Rehoboam<a name="fnB709" href="1ki_note.htm#fn709"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> king. 
<bqverse 2>2 <a name="fnB710" href="1ki_note.htm#fn710"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard the news, he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon and had been living ever since.<a name="fnB711" href="1ki_note.htm#fn711"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  They sent for him,<a name="fnB712" href="1ki_note.htm#fn712"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and Jeroboam and the whole Israelite assembly came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying, 
<bqverse 4>4  "Your father made us work too hard.<a name="fnB713" href="1ki_note.htm#fn713"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> Now if you lighten the demands he made and don't make us work as hard, we will serve you."<a name="fnB714" href="1ki_note.htm#fn714"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  He said to them, "Go away for three days, then return to me." So the people went away.<p>

<bqverse 6>6  King Rehoboam consulted with the older advisers who had served<a name="fnB715" href="1ki_note.htm#fn715"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> his father Solomon when he had been alive. He asked them,<a name="fnB716" href="1ki_note.htm#fn716"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> "How do you advise me to answer these people?" 
<bqverse 7>7  They said to him, "Today if you show a willingness to help these people and grant their request, they will be your servants from this time forward."<a name="fnB717" href="1ki_note.htm#fn717"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  But Rehoboam rejected their advice and consulted the young advisers who served him, with whom he had grown up.<a name="fnB718" href="1ki_note.htm#fn718"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  He asked them, "How do you advise me<a name="fnB719" href="1ki_note.htm#fn719"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> to respond to these people who said to me, `Lessen the demands your father placed on us'?"<a name="fnB720" href="1ki_note.htm#fn720"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  The young advisers with whom Rehoboam<a name="fnB721" href="1ki_note.htm#fn721"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> had grown up said to him, "Say this to these people who say to you, `Your father made us work hard, but now lighten our burden.'<a name="fnB722" href="1ki_note.htm#fn722"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> Say this to them: `I am a lot tougher than my father.<a name="fnB723" href="1ki_note.htm#fn723"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  My father imposed heavy demands on you; I will make them even heavier.<a name="fnB724" href="1ki_note.htm#fn724"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> My father punished you with regular whips; I will punish you with whips that really sting your flesh.'"<a name="fnB725" href="1ki_note.htm#fn725"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 12>12  Jeroboam and all the people reported<a name="fnB726" href="1ki_note.htm#fn726"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> to Rehoboam on the third day, just as the king had ordered when he said, "Return to me on the third day." 
<bqverse 13>13  The king responded to the people harshly. He rejected the advice of the older men, 
<bqverse 14>14  and followed<a name="fnB727" href="1ki_note.htm#fn727"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> the advice of the younger ones. He said, "My father imposed heavy demands on you; I will make them even heavier.<a name="fnB728" href="1ki_note.htm#fn728"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> My father punished you with regular whips; I will punish you with whips that really sting your flesh."<a name="fnB729" href="1ki_note.htm#fn729"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  The king refused to listen to the people, because the LORD was instigating this turn of events<a name="fnB730" href="1ki_note.htm#fn730"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> so that he might bring to pass the prophetic announcement he had made<a name="fnB731" href="1ki_note.htm#fn731"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.<p>

<bqverse 16>16  When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, the people answered the king, "We have no portion in David, no share in the son of Jesse.<a name="fnB732" href="1ki_note.htm#fn732"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> Return to your homes, O Israel!<a name="fnB733" href="1ki_note.htm#fn733"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> Now, look after your own dynasty, O David!"<a name="fnB734" href="1ki_note.htm#fn734"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> So Israel returned to their homes.<a name="fnB735" href="1ki_note.htm#fn735"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  (Rehoboam continued to rule over the Israelites who lived in the cities of Judah.) 
<bqverse 18>18  King Rehoboam sent Adoniram,<a name="fnB736" href="1ki_note.htm#fn736"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> the supervisor of the work crews,<a name="fnB737" href="1ki_note.htm#fn737"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> out after them, but all Israel stoned him to death. King Rehoboam managed to jump into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 19>19  So Israel has been in rebellion against the Davidic dynasty to this very day. 
<bqverse 20>20  When all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they summoned him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. No one except the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the Davidic dynasty.<a name="fnB738" href="1ki_note.htm#fn738"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 21>21  When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he summoned one hundred eighty thousand skilled warriors from all of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin<a name="fnB739" href="1ki_note.htm#fn739"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> to attack Israel and restore the kingdom to Rehoboam son of Solomon. 
<bqverse 22>22  But God told Shemaiah the prophet,<a name="fnB740" href="1ki_note.htm#fn740"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23  "Say this to King Rehoboam son of Solomon of Judah, and to all Judah and Benjamin, as well as the rest of the people, 
<bqverse 24>24  `The LORD says this: "Do not attack and make war with your brothers, the Israelites. Each of you go home, for I have caused this to happen."'"<a name="fnB741" href="1ki_note.htm#fn741"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> They obeyed the LORD and went home as the LORD had ordered them to do.<a name="fnB742" href="1ki_note.htm#fn742"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494011979"></a></p>
<p><i>Jeroboam Makes Golden Calves</i>
<p>
<bqverse 25>25 <a name="fnB743" href="1ki_note.htm#fn743"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> Jeroboam built up Shechem in the Ephraimite hill country and lived there. From there he went out and built up Penuel. 
<bqverse 26>26  Jeroboam then thought to himself:<a name="fnB744" href="1ki_note.htm#fn744"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> "Now the Davidic dynasty could regain the kingdom.<a name="fnB745" href="1ki_note.htm#fn745"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  If these people go up to offer sacrifices in the LORD's temple in Jerusalem, their loyalty could shift to their former master,<a name="fnB746" href="1ki_note.htm#fn746"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> King Rehoboam of Judah. They might kill me and return to King Rehoboam of Judah." 
<bqverse 28>28  After the king had consulted with his advisers,<a name="fnB747" href="1ki_note.htm#fn747"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> he made two golden calves. Then he said to the people,<a name="fnB748" href="1ki_note.htm#fn748"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> "It is too much trouble for you to go up to Jerusalem. Look, Israel, here are your gods who brought you up from the land of Egypt." 
<bqverse 29>29  He put one in Bethel and the other in Dan.

<p><i>A Prophet from Judah Visits Bethel</i>
<p>
<bqverse 33>33  On the fifteenth day of the eighth month (a date he had arbitrarily chosen)<a name="fnB755" href="1ki_note.htm#fn755"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> he offered sacrifices on the altar he had made in Bethel. He inaugurated a festival for the Israelites and went up to the altar to offer sacrifices. 
<bqchapter 13><A NAME="13"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Just then<a name="fnB756" href="1ki_note.htm#fn756"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> a prophet<a name="fnB757" href="1ki_note.htm#fn757"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> from Judah, sent by the LORD, arrived in Bethel,<a name="fnB758" href="1ki_note.htm#fn758"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> as Jeroboam was standing near the altar ready to offer a sacrifice. 
<bqverse 2>2  With the authority of the LORD<a name="fnB759" href="1ki_note.htm#fn759"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> he cried out against the altar, "O altar, altar! This is what the LORD says, `Look, a son named Josiah will be born to the Davidic dynasty. He will sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who offer sacrifices on you. Human bones will be burned on you.'"<a name="fnB760" href="1ki_note.htm#fn760"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  That day he also announced<a name="fnB761" href="1ki_note.htm#fn761"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> a sign, "This is the sign the LORD has predetermined:<a name="fnB762" href="1ki_note.htm#fn762"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> The altar will be split open and the ashes<a name="fnB763" href="1ki_note.htm#fn763"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> on it will fall to the ground."<a name="fnB764" href="1ki_note.htm#fn764"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  When the king heard what the prophet<a name="fnB765" href="1ki_note.htm#fn765"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> cried out against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam, standing at the altar, extended his hand<a name="fnB766" href="1ki_note.htm#fn766"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> and ordered,<a name="fnB767" href="1ki_note.htm#fn767"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> "Seize him!" The hand he had extended shriveled up<a name="fnB768" href="1ki_note.htm#fn768"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> and he could not pull it back. 
<bqverse 5>5  The altar split open and the ashes<a name="fnB769" href="1ki_note.htm#fn769"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> fell from the altar to the ground,<a name="fnB770" href="1ki_note.htm#fn770"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> in fulfillment of the sign the prophet had announced with the LORD's authority.<a name="fnB771" href="1ki_note.htm#fn771"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  The king pled with<a name="fnB772" href="1ki_note.htm#fn772"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> the prophet,<a name="fnB773" href="1ki_note.htm#fn773"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> "Seek the favor of<a name="fnB774" href="1ki_note.htm#fn774"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD your God and pray for me, so my hand may be restored." So the prophet sought the LORD's favor<a name="fnB775" href="1ki_note.htm#fn775"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> and the king's hand was restored to its former condition.<a name="fnB776" href="1ki_note.htm#fn776"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  The king then said to the prophet, "Come home with me and have something to eat. I'd like to give a present." 
<bqverse 8>8  But the prophet said to the king, "Even if you were to give me half your possessions,<a name="fnB777" href="1ki_note.htm#fn777"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> I could not go with you and eat and drink<a name="fnB778" href="1ki_note.htm#fn778"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> in this place. 
<bqverse 9>9  For the LORD gave me strict orders,<a name="fnB779" href="1ki_note.htm#fn779"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> `Do not eat or drink<a name="fnB780" href="1ki_note.htm#fn780"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> there and do not go home the way you came.'" 
<bqverse 10>10  So he started back on another road; he did not travel back on the same road he had taken to Bethel.<p>

<bqverse 11>11  Now there was an old prophet living in Bethel. When his sons came home, they told their father<a name="fnB781" href="1ki_note.htm#fn781"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> everything the prophet<a name="fnB782" href="1ki_note.htm#fn782"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> had done in Bethel that day and all the words he had spoken to the king.<a name="fnB783" href="1ki_note.htm#fn783"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  Their father asked them, "Which road did he take?" His sons showed him<a name="fnB784" href="1ki_note.htm#fn784"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> the road the prophet<a name="fnB785" href="1ki_note.htm#fn785"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> from Judah had taken. 
<bqverse 13>13  He then told his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me." When they had saddled the donkey for him, he mounted it 
<bqverse 14>14  and took off after the prophet,<a name="fnB786" href="1ki_note.htm#fn786"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> whom he found sitting under an oak tree. He asked him, "Are you the prophet<a name="fnB787" href="1ki_note.htm#fn787"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> from Judah?" He answered, "Yes, I am." 
<bqverse 15>15  He then said to him, "Come home with me and eat something." 
<bqverse 16>16  But he replied, "I can't go back with you<a name="fnB788" href="1ki_note.htm#fn788"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> or eat and drink<a name="fnB789" href="1ki_note.htm#fn789"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> with you in this place. 
<bqverse 17>17  For the LORD gave me strict orders,<a name="fnB790" href="1ki_note.htm#fn790"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> `Do not eat or drink<a name="fnB791" href="1ki_note.htm#fn791"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> there; do not go back the way you came.'" 
<bqverse 18>18  The old prophet then said,<a name="fnB792" href="1ki_note.htm#fn792"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> "I too am a prophet like you. An angel told me with the LORD's authority,<a name="fnB793" href="1ki_note.htm#fn793"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> `Bring him back with you to your house so he can eat and drink.'"<a name="fnB794" href="1ki_note.htm#fn794"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> But he was lying to him.<a name="fnB795" href="1ki_note.htm#fn795"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  So the prophet went back with him and ate and drank in his house.<a name="fnB796" href="1ki_note.htm#fn796"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 20>20  While they were sitting at the table, the LORD spoke through the old prophet<a name="fnB797" href="1ki_note.htm#fn797"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  and he cried out to the prophet from Judah, "This is what the LORD says, `You<a name="fnB798" href="1ki_note.htm#fn798"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> have rebelled against the LORD<a name="fnB799" href="1ki_note.htm#fn799"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> and have not obeyed the command which the LORD your God gave you. 
<bqverse 22>22  You went back and ate and drank in this place, even though he said to you, "Do not eat or drink there."<a name="fnB800" href="1ki_note.htm#fn800"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> Therefore<a name="fnB801" href="1ki_note.htm#fn801"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> your corpse will not be buried in your ancestral tomb.'"<a name="fnB802" href="1ki_note.htm#fn802"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 23>23  When the prophet from Judah finished his meal,<a name="fnB803" href="1ki_note.htm#fn803"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> the old prophet saddled his visitor's donkey for him.<a name="fnB804" href="1ki_note.htm#fn804"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  As the prophet from Judah was traveling, a lion attacked him on the road and killed him.<a name="fnB805" href="1ki_note.htm#fn805"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> His corpse was lying on the road, and the donkey and the lion just stood there beside it.<a name="fnB806" href="1ki_note.htm#fn806"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  Some men came by<a name="fnB807" href="1ki_note.htm#fn807"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> and saw the corpse lying in the road with the lion standing beside it.<a name="fnB808" href="1ki_note.htm#fn808"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> They went and reported what they had seen<a name="fnB809" href="1ki_note.htm#fn809"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> in the city where the old prophet lived. 
<bqverse 26>26  When the old prophet who had invited him to his house heard the news,<a name="fnB810" href="1ki_note.htm#fn810"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> he said, "It is the prophet<a name="fnB811" href="1ki_note.htm#fn811"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> who rebelled against the LORD.<a name="fnB812" href="1ki_note.htm#fn812"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> The LORD delivered him over to the lion and it ripped him up<a name="fnB813" href="1ki_note.htm#fn813"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> and killed him, just as the LORD warned him."<a name="fnB814" href="1ki_note.htm#fn814"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  He told his sons, "Saddle my donkey," and they did so.<a name="fnB815" href="1ki_note.htm#fn815"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  He went and found the corpse lying in the road with the donkey and the lion standing beside it;<a name="fnB816" href="1ki_note.htm#fn816"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> the lion had neither eaten the corpse nor attacked the donkey. 
<bqverse 29>29  The old prophet<a name="fnB817" href="1ki_note.htm#fn817"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> picked up the corpse of the prophet,<a name="fnB818" href="1ki_note.htm#fn818"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> put it on the donkey, and brought it back. The old prophet then entered the city to mourn him and to bury him. 
<bqverse 30>30  He put the corpse into his own tomb, and they<a name="fnB819" href="1ki_note.htm#fn819"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> mourned over him, saying, "Ah, my brother!" 
<bqverse 31>31  After he buried him, he said to his sons, "When I die, bury me in the tomb where the prophet<a name="fnB820" href="1ki_note.htm#fn820"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a> is buried; put my bones right beside his bones, 
<bqverse 32>32  for the prophecy he announced with the LORD's authority<a name="fnB821" href="1ki_note.htm#fn821"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> against the altar in Bethel and against all the temples on the high places in the cities of the north<a name="fnB822" href="1ki_note.htm#fn822"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a> will certainly be fulfilled."<a name="_Toc494011981"></a></p>
<p><i>A Prophet Announces the End of Jeroboam's Dynasty</i>
<p>
<bqverse 33>33  After this happened, Jeroboam still did not change his evil ways;<a name="fnB823" href="1ki_note.htm#fn823"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>69</SUP></FONT></a> he continued to appoint common people<a name="fnB824" href="1ki_note.htm#fn824"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>70</SUP></FONT></a> as priests at the high places. Anyone who wanted the job he consecrated as a priest.<a name="fnB825" href="1ki_note.htm#fn825"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>71</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 34>34  This sin caused Jeroboam's dynasty<a name="fnB826" href="1ki_note.htm#fn826"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>72</SUP></FONT></a> to come to an end and to be destroyed from the face of the earth. <p>

<bqchapter 14><A NAME="14"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b><a name="fnB827" href="1ki_note.htm#fn827"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> At that time Jeroboam's son Abijah became sick. 
<bqverse 2>2  Jeroboam told his wife, "Disguise<a name="fnB828" href="1ki_note.htm#fn828"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> yourself so that people cannot recognize you are Jeroboam's wife.

<bqverse 3>3  Take<a name="fnB830" href="1ki_note.htm#fn830"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> ten loaves of bread, some small cakes, and a container of honey and visit him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy." <p>

<bqverse 4>4  Jeroboam's wife did as she was told. She went to Shiloh and visited Ahijah.<a name="fnB831" href="1ki_note.htm#fn831"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> Now Ahijah could not see; he had lost his eyesight in his old age.<a name="fnB832" href="1ki_note.htm#fn832"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  But the LORD had told Ahijah, "Look, Jeroboam's wife is coming to find out from you what will happen to her son, for he is sick. Tell her so-and-so.<a name="fnB833" href="1ki_note.htm#fn833"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> When she comes, she will be in a disguise." 
<bqverse 6>6  When Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps as she came through the door, he said, "Come on in, wife of Jeroboam! Why are you pretending to be someone else? I have been commissioned to give you bad news.<a name="fnB834" href="1ki_note.htm#fn834"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  Go, tell Jeroboam, `This is what the LORD God of Israel says: "I raised you up<a name="fnB835" href="1ki_note.htm#fn835"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> from among the people and made you ruler over my people Israel. 
<bqverse 8>8  I tore the kingdom away from the Davidic dynasty and gave it to you.

<bqverse 9>9  You have sinned more than all who came before you. You went and angered me by making other gods, formed out of metal; you have completely disregarded me.<a name="fnB837" href="1ki_note.htm#fn837"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  So I am ready to bring disaster<a name="fnB838" href="1ki_note.htm#fn838"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> on the dynasty<a name="fnB839" href="1ki_note.htm#fn839"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> of Jeroboam.

<bqverse 11>11  Dogs will eat the ones<a name="fnB842" href="1ki_note.htm#fn842"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> who die in the city, and the birds of the sky will eat the ones who die in the country."' Indeed the LORD has announced it.<p>

<bqverse 12>12  "As for you, get up and go home. When you set foot in the city, the boy will die. 
<bqverse 13>13  All Israel will mourn him and bury him. He is the only one in Jeroboam's family<a name="fnB843" href="1ki_note.htm#fn843"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> who will receive a decent burial, for he is the only one in whom the LORD God of Israel found anything good. 
<bqverse 14>14  The LORD will raise up a king over Israel who will cut off Jeroboam's dynasty.<a name="fnB844" href="1ki_note.htm#fn844"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> It is ready to happen!<a name="fnB845" href="1ki_note.htm#fn845"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  The LORD will attack Israel, making it like a reed that sways in the water.<a name="fnB846" href="1ki_note.htm#fn846"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> He will remove Israel from this good land he gave to their ancestors<a name="fnB847" href="1ki_note.htm#fn847"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> and scatter them beyond the Euphrates River,<a name="fnB848" href="1ki_note.htm#fn848"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> because they angered the LORD by making Asherah poles.<a name="fnB849" href="1ki_note.htm#fn849"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  He will hand Israel over to their enemies<a name="fnB850" href="1ki_note.htm#fn850"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> because of the sins which Jeroboam committed and which he made Israel commit."<p>

<bqverse 17>17  So Jeroboam's wife got up and went back to<a name="fnB851" href="1ki_note.htm#fn851"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> Tirzah. As she crossed the threshold of the house, the boy died. 
<bqverse 18>18  All Israel buried him and mourned for him, just as the LORD had predicted<a name="fnB852" href="1ki_note.htm#fn852"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> through his servant the prophet Ahijah.<a name="_Toc494011982"></a></p>
<p><i>Jeroboam's Reign Ends</i>

<bqverse 19>19  The rest of the events of Jeroboam's reign, including the details of his battles and rule, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.<a name="fnB853" href="1ki_note.htm#fn853"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  Jeroboam ruled for twenty-two years; then he passed away.<a name="fnB854" href="1ki_note.htm#fn854"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> His son Nadab replaced him as king.<a name="_Toc494011983"></a></p>
<p><i>Rehoboam's Reign over Judah </i>
<p>
<bqverse 21>21  Now Rehoboam son of Solomon ruled in Judah.

<bqverse 22>22  Judah did evil before<a name="fnB857" href="1ki_note.htm#fn857"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD.

<bqverse 23>23  They even built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree.

<bqverse 25>25  In King Rehoboam's fifth year, King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 26>26  He took away the treasures of the LORD's temple and of the royal palace; he took everything, including all the golden shields that Solomon had made. 
<bqverse 27>27  King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned them to the officers of the royal guard<a name="fnB861" href="1ki_note.htm#fn861"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> who protected the entrance to the royal palace. 
<bqverse 28>28  Whenever the king visited the LORD's temple, the royal guard carried them and then brought them back to the guardroom.<p>

<p><i>Abijah's Reign over Judah</i>
<p><A NAME="15"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam son of Nebat, Abijah<a name="fnB865" href="1ki_note.htm#fn865"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> became king over Judah. 
<bqverse 2>2  He ruled for three years in Jerusalem. His mother was Maacah, the daughter of Abishalom.<a name="fnB866" href="1ki_note.htm#fn866"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Asa's Reign over Judah</i>
<p>
<bqverse 9>9  In the twentieth year of Jeroboam's reign over Israel, Asa became the king of Judah. 
<bqverse 10>10  He ruled for forty-one years in Jerusalem. His grandmother<a name="fnB880" href="1ki_note.htm#fn880"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> was Maacah daughter of Abishalom. 
<bqverse 11>11 Asa did what the LORD approved<a name="fnB881" href="1ki_note.htm#fn881"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> like his ancestor<a name="fnB882" href="1ki_note.htm#fn882"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> David had done. 
<bqverse 12>12  He removed the male cultic prostitutes from the land and got rid of all the disgusting idols<a name="fnB883" href="1ki_note.htm#fn883"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> his ancestors<a name="fnB884" href="1ki_note.htm#fn884"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> had made. 
<bqverse 13>13  He also removed Maacah his grandmother<a name="fnB885" href="1ki_note.htm#fn885"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> from her position as queen because she had made a loathsome Asherah pole. Asa cut down her Asherah pole and burned it in the Kidron Valley. 
<bqverse 14>14  The high places were not eliminated, yet Asa was wholeheartedly devoted to the LORD throughout his lifetime.<a name="fnB886" href="1ki_note.htm#fn886"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  He brought the holy items that he and his father had made into the LORD's temple, including the silver, gold, and other articles.<a name="fnB887" href="1ki_note.htm#fn887"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 16>16  Now Asa and King Baasha of Israel were continually at war with each other.<a name="fnB888" href="1ki_note.htm#fn888"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  King Baasha of Israel attacked Judah and established Ramah as a military outpost to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the land of King Asa of Judah.<a name="fnB889" href="1ki_note.htm#fn889"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  Asa took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the LORD's temple and of the royal palace and handed it to his servants. He then told them to deliver it<a name="fnB890" href="1ki_note.htm#fn890"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> to Ben Hadad son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, ruler in Damascus, along with this message: 
<bqverse 19>19  "I want to make a treaty with you, like the one our fathers made.<a name="fnB891" href="1ki_note.htm#fn891"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> See, I have sent you silver and gold as a present.

<bqverse 20>20  Ben Hadad accepted King Asa's offer and ordered his army commanders to attack the cities of Israel.<a name="fnB893" href="1ki_note.htm#fn893"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> They conquered<a name="fnB894" href="1ki_note.htm#fn894"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maacah, and all the territory of Naphtali, including the region of Kinnereth.<a name="fnB895" href="1ki_note.htm#fn895"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  When Baasha heard the news, he stopped fortifying<a name="fnB896" href="1ki_note.htm#fn896"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> Ramah and settled down in Tirzah. 
<bqverse 22>22  King Asa ordered all the men of Judah (no exemptions were granted) to carry away the stones and wood that Baasha had used to build Ramah.<a name="fnB897" href="1ki_note.htm#fn897"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> King Asa used the materials to build up<a name="fnB898" href="1ki_note.htm#fn898"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> Geba (in Benjamin) and Mizpah.<p>

<bqverse 24>24  Asa passed away<a name="fnB901" href="1ki_note.htm#fn901"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> and was buried with his ancestors in the city of his ancestor David. His son Jehoshaphat replaced him as king.<a name="_Toc494011986"></a></p>
<p><i>Nadab's Reign over Israel</i>
<p>
<bqverse 25>25  In the second year of Asa's reign over Judah, Jeroboam's son Nadab became the king of Israel; he ruled Israel for two years. 
<bqverse 26>26  He did evil before<a name="fnB902" href="1ki_note.htm#fn902"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD. He followed in his father's footsteps and encouraged Israel to sin.<a name="fnB903" href="1ki_note.htm#fn903"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 27>27  Baasha son of Ahijah, from the tribe of Issachar, conspired against Nadab<a name="fnB904" href="1ki_note.htm#fn904"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> and assassinated him in Gibbethon, which was in Philistine territory. This happened while Nadab and all the Israelite army were besieging Gibbethon. 
<bqverse 28>28  Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa's reign over Judah and replaced him as king. 
<bqverse 29>29  When he became king, he executed Jeroboam's entire family. He wiped out everyone who breathed,<a name="fnB905" href="1ki_note.htm#fn905"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> just as the LORD had predicted<a name="fnB906" href="1ki_note.htm#fn906"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> through his servant Ahijah the Shilonite. 
<bqverse 30>30  This happened because of the sins which Jeroboam committed and which he made Israel commit. These sins angered the LORD God of Israel.<a name="fnB907" href="1ki_note.htm#fn907"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 31>31  The rest of the events of Nadab's reign, including all his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.<a name="fnB908" href="1ki_note.htm#fn908"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 32>32  Asa and King Nadab of Israel were continually at war with each other.<a name="_Toc494011987"></a></p>
<p><i>Baasha's Reign over Israel</i>
<p>
<bqverse 33>33  In the third year of Asa's reign over Judah, Baasha son of Ahijah became king over all Israel in Tirzah; he ruled for twenty-four years. 
<bqverse 34>34  He did evil before<a name="fnB909" href="1ki_note.htm#fn909"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD; he followed in Jeroboam's footsteps and encouraged Israel to sin.<a name="fnB910" href="1ki_note.htm#fn910"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqchapter 16><A NAME="16"><b>

<p><i>Elah's Reign over Israel</i>
<p>
<bqverse 8>8  In the twenty-sixth year of King Asa's reign over Judah, Baasha's son Elah became king over Israel; he ruled in Tirzah for two years. 
<bqverse 9>9  His servant Zimri, a commander of half of his chariot force, conspired against him. While Elah was drinking heavily<a name="fnB922" href="1ki_note.htm#fn922"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> at the house of Arza, who supervised the palace in Tirzah, 
<bqverse 10>10  Zimri came in and struck him dead. (This happened in the twenty-seventh year of Asa's reign over Judah.) Zimri replaced Elah as king.<a name="fnB923" href="1ki_note.htm#fn923"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  When he became king and occupied the throne, he killed Baasha's entire family. He did not spare any male belonging to him; he killed his relatives and his friends.<a name="fnB924" href="1ki_note.htm#fn924"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 12>12  Zimri destroyed Baasha's entire family, just as the LORD had predicted to Baasha<a name="fnB925" href="1ki_note.htm#fn925"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> through Jehu the prophet. 
<bqverse 13>13  This happened because of all the sins which Baasha and his son Elah committed and which they made Israel commit. They angered the LORD God of Israel with their worthless idols.<a name="fnB926" href="1ki_note.htm#fn926"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<p><i>Zimri's Reign over Israel</i>
<p>
<bqverse 15>15  In the twenty-seventh year of Asa's reign over Judah, Zimri became king over Israel; he ruled for seven days in Tirzah. Zimri's revolt took place while the army was deployed<a name="fnB928" href="1ki_note.htm#fn928"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> in Gibbethon, which was in Philistine territory. 
<bqverse 16>16  While deployed there, the army received this report:<a name="fnB929" href="1ki_note.htm#fn929"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> "Zimri has conspired against the king and assassinated him."<a name="fnB930" href="1ki_note.htm#fn930"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> So all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that very day in the camp. 
<bqverse 17>17  Omri and all Israel went up from Gibbethon and besieged Tirzah. 
<bqverse 18>18  When Zimri saw that the city was captured, he went into the fortified area of the royal palace. He set the palace on fire and died in the flames.<a name="fnB931" href="1ki_note.htm#fn931"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  This happened because of the sins he committed.

<p><i>Omri's Reign over Israel</i>
<p>
<bqverse 21>21  At that time the people of Israel were divided in their loyalties. Half the people supported Tibni son of Ginath and wanted to make him king; the other half supported Omri. 
<bqverse 22>22  Omri's supporters were stronger than those who supported Tibni son of Ginath. Tibni died; Omri became king.<p>

<bqverse 23>23  In the thirty-first year of Asa's reign over Judah, Omri became king over Israel. He ruled for twelve years, six of them in Tirzah. 
<bqverse 24>24  He purchased the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two units<a name="fnB935" href="1ki_note.htm#fn935"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> of silver. He launched a construction project there<a name="fnB936" href="1ki_note.htm#fn936"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> and named the city he built after Shemer, the former owner of the hill of Samaria. 
<bqverse 25>25  Omri did more evil before<a name="fnB937" href="1ki_note.htm#fn937"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD than all who were before him. 
<bqverse 26>26  He followed in the footsteps of Jeroboam son of Nebat and encouraged Israel to sin;<a name="fnB938" href="1ki_note.htm#fn938"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> they angered the LORD God of Israel with their worthless idols.<a name="fnB939" href="1ki_note.htm#fn939"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<p><i>Ahab Promotes Idolatry</i>
<p>
<bqverse 29>29  In the thirty-eighth year of Asa's reign over Judah, Omri's son Ahab became king over Israel. Ahab son of Omri ruled over Israel for twenty-two years in Samaria. 
<bqverse 30>30  Ahab son of Omri did more evil before<a name="fnB943" href="1ki_note.htm#fn943"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD than all who were before him. 
<bqverse 31>31  As if following in the sinful footsteps of Jeroboam son of Nebat were not bad enough, he married Jezebel the daughter of King Ethbaal of the Sidonians. Then he worshiped and bowed to Baal.<a name="fnB944" href="1ki_note.htm#fn944"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 32>32  He set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal he had built in Samaria.

<bqverse 3>3  "Leave here and travel eastward. Hide out in the Kerith Valley near the Jordan. 
<bqverse 4>4  Drink from the stream; I have already told<a name="fnB954" href="1ki_note.htm#fn954"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> the ravens to bring you food<a name="fnB955" href="1ki_note.htm#fn955"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> there." 
<bqverse 5>5  So he did<a name="fnB956" href="1ki_note.htm#fn956"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> as the LORD told him; he went and lived in the Kerith Valley near the Jordan. 
<bqverse 6>6  The ravens would bring him bread and meat each morning and evening, and he would drink from the stream.<p>

<bqverse 7>7  After a while,<a name="fnB957" href="1ki_note.htm#fn957"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> the stream dried up because there had been no rain in the land. 
<bqverse 8>8  The LORD told him,<a name="fnB958" href="1ki_note.htm#fn958"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  "Get up, go to Zarephath in Sidonian territory, and live there. I have already told<a name="fnB959" href="1ki_note.htm#fn959"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> a widow who lives there to provide for you." 
<bqverse 10>10  So he got up and went to Zarephath. When he went through the city gate, there was a widow gathering wood. He called out to her, "Please give me a cup<a name="fnB960" href="1ki_note.htm#fn960"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> of water, so I can take a drink." 
<bqverse 11>11  As she went to get it, he called out to her, "Please bring me a piece of bread."<a name="fnB961" href="1ki_note.htm#fn961"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  She said, "As certainly as the LORD your God lives, I have no food, except for a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. Right now I am gathering a couple of sticks for a fire. Then I'm going home to make one final meal for my son and myself. After we have eaten that, we will die of starvation."<a name="fnB962" href="1ki_note.htm#fn962"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  Elijah said to her, "Don't be afraid. Go and do as you planned.<a name="fnB963" href="1ki_note.htm#fn963"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> But first make a small cake for me and bring it to me; then make something for yourself and your son. 
<bqverse 14>14  For this is what the LORD God of Israel says, `The jar of flour will not be empty and the jug of oil will not run out until the day the LORD makes it rain on the surface of the ground.'" 
<bqverse 15>15  She went and did as Elijah told her; there was always enough food for Elijah and for her and her family.<a name="fnB964" href="1ki_note.htm#fn964"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  The jar of flour was never empty and the jug of oil never ran out, just as the LORD had promised<a name="fnB965" href="1ki_note.htm#fn965"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> through Elijah.<p>

<bqverse 17>17  After this<a name="fnB966" href="1ki_note.htm#fn966"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> the son of the woman who owned the house got sick. His illness was so severe he could no longer breathe. 
<bqverse 18>18  She asked Elijah, "Why, prophet, have you come<a name="fnB967" href="1ki_note.htm#fn967"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> to me to confront me with<a name="fnB968" href="1ki_note.htm#fn968"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> my sin and kill my son?" 
<bqverse 19>19  He said to her, "Hand me your son." He took him from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him down on his bed. 
<bqverse 20>20  Then he called out to the LORD, "O LORD, my God, are you also bringing disaster on this widow I am staying with by killing her son?" 
<bqverse 21>21  He stretched out over the boy three times and called out to the LORD, "O LORD, my God, please let this boy's breath return to him." 
<bqverse 22>22  The LORD answered Elijah's prayer; the boy's breath returned to him and he lived. 
<bqverse 23>23  Elijah took the boy, brought him down from the upper room to the house, and handed him to his mother. Elijah then said, "See, your son is alive!" 
<bqverse 24>24  The woman said to Elijah, "Now I know that you are a prophet and that the LORD really does speak through you."<a name="fnB969" href="1ki_note.htm#fn969"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Elijah Meets the King's Servant</i>
<p><A NAME="18"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Some time later, in the third year of the famine, the LORD told Elijah,<a name="fnB970" href="1ki_note.htm#fn970"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> "Go, make an appearance before Ahab, so I may send rain on the surface of the ground." 
<bqverse 2>2  So Elijah went to make an appearance before Ahab.<p>
Now the famine was severe in Samaria. 
<bqverse 3>3  So Ahab summoned Obadiah, who supervised the palace. (Now Obadiah was a very loyal follower of the LORD.<a name="fnB971" href="1ki_note.htm#fn971"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  When Jezebel was killing<a name="fnB972" href="1ki_note.htm#fn972"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD's prophets, Obadiah took one hundred prophets and hid them in two caves in two groups of fifty. He also brought them food and water.) 
<bqverse 5>5  Ahab told Obadiah, "Go through the land to all the springs and valleys. Maybe we can find some grazing areas<a name="fnB973" href="1ki_note.htm#fn973"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> so we can keep the horses and mules alive and not have to kill<a name="fnB974" href="1ki_note.htm#fn974"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> some of the animals." 
<bqverse 6>6  They divided up the land between them; Ahab went<a name="fnB975" href="1ki_note.htm#fn975"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> one way and Obadiah went the other.<p>

<bqverse 7>7  As Obadiah was traveling along, Elijah met him.<a name="fnB976" href="1ki_note.htm#fn976"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> When he recognized him, he fell facedown to the ground and said, "Is it really you, my master, Elijah?" 
<bqverse 8>8  He replied, "Yes,<a name="fnB977" href="1ki_note.htm#fn977"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> go and say to your master, `Elijah is back.'"<a name="fnB978" href="1ki_note.htm#fn978"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  Obadiah<a name="fnB979" href="1ki_note.htm#fn979"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> said, "What sin have I committed that you are ready to hand your servant over to Ahab for execution?<a name="fnB980" href="1ki_note.htm#fn980"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  As certainly as the LORD your God lives, my master has sent to every nation and kingdom in an effort to find you. When they say, `He's not here,' he makes them<a name="fnB981" href="1ki_note.htm#fn981"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> swear an oath that they could not find you. 
<bqverse 11>11  Now you say, `Go and say to your master, "Elijah is back."`<a name="fnB982" href="1ki_note.htm#fn982"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  But when I leave you, the LORD's spirit will carry you away so I can't find you.<a name="fnB983" href="1ki_note.htm#fn983"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> If I go tell Ahab I've seen you, he won't be able to find you and he will kill me.<a name="fnB984" href="1ki_note.htm#fn984"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> That would not be fair,<a name="fnB985" href="1ki_note.htm#fn985"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> because your servant has been a loyal follower of<a name="fnB986" href="1ki_note.htm#fn986"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD from my youth. 
<bqverse 13>13  Certainly my master is aware of what I did<a name="fnB987" href="1ki_note.htm#fn987"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> when Jezebel was killing the LORD's prophets. I hid one hundred of the LORD's prophets in two caves in two groups of fifty and I brought them food and water. 
<bqverse 14>14  Now you say, `Go and say to your master, "Elijah is back,"`<a name="fnB988" href="1ki_note.htm#fn988"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> but he will kill me." 
<bqverse 15>15  But Elijah said, "As certainly as the sovereign LORD<a name="fnB989" href="1ki_note.htm#fn989"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> lives (whom I serve),<a name="fnB990" href="1ki_note.htm#fn990"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> I will make an appearance before him today." <a name="_Toc494011994"></a></p>
<p><i>Elijah Confronts Baal's Prophets</i>
<p>
<bqverse 16>16  When Obadiah went and informed Ahab, the king went to meet Elijah.<a name="fnB991" href="1ki_note.htm#fn991"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  When Ahab saw Elijah, he<a name="fnB992" href="1ki_note.htm#fn992"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> said to him, "Is it really you, the one who brings disaster<a name="fnB993" href="1ki_note.htm#fn993"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> on Israel?" 
<bqverse 18>18  Elijah<a name="fnB994" href="1ki_note.htm#fn994"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> replied, "I have not brought disaster<a name="fnB995" href="1ki_note.htm#fn995"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> on Israel. But you and your father's dynasty have, by abandoning the LORD's commandments and following the Baals. 
<bqverse 19>19  Now send out messengers<a name="fnB996" href="1ki_note.htm#fn996"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> and assemble all Israel before me at Mount Carmel, as well as the four hundred fifty prophets of Baal and four hundred prophets of Asherah whom Jezebel supports.<a name="fnB997" href="1ki_note.htm#fn997"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 20>20  Ahab sent messengers to all the Israelites and had the prophets assemble at Mount Carmel. 
<bqverse 21>21  Elijah approached all the people and said, "How long are you going to be paralyzed by indecision?<a name="fnB998" href="1ki_note.htm#fn998"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> If the LORD is the true God,<a name="fnB999" href="1ki_note.htm#fn999"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> then follow him, but if Baal is, follow him!" But the people did not say a word. 
<bqverse 22>22  Elijah said to them:<a name="fnB1000" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1000"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> "I am the only prophet of the LORD who is left, but the prophets of Baal number four hundred fifty. 
<bqverse 23>23  Let them bring us two bulls. Let them choose one of the bulls for themselves, cut it up into pieces, and place it on the wood. But they must not set it on fire. I will do the same to the other bull and place it on the wood. But I will not set it on fire. 
<bqverse 24>24  Then you<a name="fnB1001" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1001"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> will invoke the name of your god, and I will invoke the name of the LORD. The god who responds with fire will demonstrate that he is the true God."<a name="fnB1002" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1002"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> All the people responded, "This will be a fair test."<a name="fnB1003" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1003"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 25>25  Elijah told the prophets of Baal, "Choose one of the bulls for yourselves and go first, for you are the majority. Invoke the name of your god, but do not light a fire."<a name="fnB1004" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1004"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  So they took a bull, as he had suggested,<a name="fnB1005" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1005"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> and prepared it. They invoked the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, "Baal, answer us." But there was no sound and no answer. They jumped<a name="fnB1006" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1006"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> around on the altar they had made.<a name="fnB1007" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1007"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  At noon Elijah mocked them, "Yell louder. After all, he is a god; he may be deep in thought, or perhaps he stepped out for a moment or has taken a trip. Perhaps he is sleeping and needs to be awakened."<a name="fnB1008" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1008"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  So they yelled louder and, in accordance with their prescribed ritual,<a name="fnB1009" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1009"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> mutilated themselves with swords and spears until their bodies were covered with blood.<a name="fnB1010" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1010"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 29>29  Throughout the afternoon they were in an ecstatic frenzy,<a name="fnB1011" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1011"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> but there was no sound, no answer, and no response.<a name="fnB1012" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1012"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 30>30  Elijah then told all the people, "Approach me." So all the people approached him. He repaired the altar of the LORD that had been torn down.<a name="fnB1013" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1013"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 31>31  Then Elijah took twelve stones, corresponding to the number of tribes that descended from Jacob, to whom the LORD had said, "Israel will be your new<a name="fnB1014" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1014"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> name."<a name="fnB1015" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1015"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 32>32  With the stones he constructed an altar for the LORD.<a name="fnB1016" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1016"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> Around the altar he made a trench large enough to contain two seahs<a name="fnB1017" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1017"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> of seed. 
<bqverse 33>33  He arranged the wood, cut up the bull, and placed it on the wood. 
<bqverse 34>34  Then he said, "Fill four water jars and pour the water on the offering and the wood." When they had done so,<a name="fnB1018" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1018"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> he said, "Do it again." So they did it again. Then he said, "Do it a third time." So they did it a third time. 
<bqverse 35>35  The water flowed down all sides of the altar and filled the trench. 
<bqverse 36>36  When it was time for the evening offering,<a name="fnB1019" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1019"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> Elijah the prophet approached the altar<a name="fnB1020" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1020"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> and prayed: "O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, prove<a name="fnB1021" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1021"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command. 
<bqverse 37>37  Answer me, O LORD, answer me, so these people will know that you, O LORD, are the true God<a name="fnB1022" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1022"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> and that you are winning back their allegiance.<a name="fnB1023" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1023"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 38>38  Then fire from the LORD fell from the sky.<a name="fnB1024" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1024"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> It consumed the offering, the wood, the stones, and the dirt, and licked up the water in the trench. 
<bqverse 39>39  When all the people saw this, they fell face down to the ground and said, "The LORD is the true God!<a name="fnB1025" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1025"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> The LORD is the true God!" 
<bqverse 40>40  Elijah told them, "Seize the prophets of Baal! Don't let even one of them escape!" So they seized them, and Elijah led them down to the Kishon Valley and executed<a name="fnB1026" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1026"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> them there.<p>

<bqverse 41>41  Then Elijah told Ahab, "Go on up and eat and drink, for the sound of a heavy rainstorm can be heard."<a name="fnB1027" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1027"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 42>42  So Ahab went on up to eat and drink, while Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel. He bent down toward the ground and put his face between his knees. 
<bqverse 43>43  He told his servant, "Go on up and look in the direction of the sea." So he went on up, looked, and reported, "There is nothing."<a name="fnB1028" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1028"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> Seven times Elijah sent him to look.<a name="fnB1029" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1029"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 44>44  The seventh time the servant<a name="fnB1030" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1030"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> said, "Look, a small cloud, the size of the palm of a man's hand, is rising up from the sea." Elijah<a name="fnB1031" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1031"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> then said, "Go and tell Ahab, `Hitch up the chariots and go down, so that the rain won't overtake you.'"<a name="fnB1032" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1032"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 45>45  Meanwhile the sky was covered with dark clouds, the wind blew, and there was a heavy rainstorm. Ahab rode toward<a name="fnB1033" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1033"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> Jezreel. 
<bqverse 46>46  Now the LORD energized Elijah with power;<a name="fnB1034" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1034"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> he tucked his robe into his belt<a name="fnB1035" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1035"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a> and ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel.

<a name="_Toc494011995"></a></p>
<p><i>Elijah Runs for His Life</i>
<p><A NAME="19"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, including a detailed account of how he killed all the prophets with the sword. 
<bqverse 2>2  Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah with this warning,<a name="fnB1036" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1036"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> "May the gods judge me severely<a name="fnB1037" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1037"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> if by this time tomorrow I do not take your life as you did theirs."<a name="fnB1038" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1038"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 3>3  Elijah was afraid,<a name="fnB1039" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1039"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> so he got up and fled for his life to Beersheba in Judah. He left his servant there, 
<bqverse 4>4  while he went a day's journey into the desert. He went and sat down under a shrub<a name="fnB1040" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1040"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and asked the LORD to take his life:<a name="fnB1041" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1041"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> "I've had enough! Now, O LORD, take my life. After all, I'm no better than my ancestors."<a name="fnB1042" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1042"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  He stretched out<a name="fnB1043" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1043"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> and fell asleep under the shrub. All of a sudden an angelic messenger<a name="fnB1044" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1044"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> touched him and said, "Get up and eat." 
<bqverse 6>6  He looked and right there by his head was a cake baking on hot coals and a jug of water. He ate and drank and then slept some more.<a name="fnB1045" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1045"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  The LORD's angelic messenger came back again, touched him, and said, "Get up and eat, for otherwise you won't be able to make the journey."<a name="fnB1046" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1046"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  So he got up and ate and drank. That meal gave him the strength to travel forty days and forty nights until he reached the mountain of God in Horeb.<p>

<bqverse 9>9  He went into a cave there and spent the night. All of a sudden the LORD spoke to him, "Why are you here, Elijah?" 
<bqverse 10>10  He answered, "I have been absolutely loyal<a name="fnB1047" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1047"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> to the LORD, the sovereign God,<a name="fnB1048" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1048"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> even though the Israelites have abandoned the agreement they made with you,<a name="fnB1049" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1049"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left and now they want to take my life."<a name="fnB1050" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1050"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  The LORD<a name="fnB1051" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1051"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> said, "Go out and stand on the mountain before the LORD. Look, the LORD is ready to pass by."<p>
A very powerful wind went before the LORD, digging into the mountain and causing landslides,<a name="fnB1052" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1052"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> but the LORD was not in the wind. After the windstorm there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake. 
<bqverse 12>12  After the earthquake, there was a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. After the fire, there was a soft whisper.<a name="fnB1053" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1053"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  When Elijah heard it, he covered his face with his robe and went out and stood at the entrance to the cave. All of a sudden<a name="fnB1054" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1054"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> a voice asked him, "Why are you here, Elijah?" 
<bqverse 14>14  He answered, "I have been absolutely loyal<a name="fnB1055" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1055"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> to the LORD, the sovereign God,<a name="fnB1056" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1056"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> even though the Israelites have abandoned the agreement they made with you,<a name="fnB1057" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1057"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left and now they want to take my life."<a name="fnB1058" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1058"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  The LORD said to him, "Go back the way you came and then head for the Desert of Damascus. Go and anoint Hazael king over Syria. 
<bqverse 16>16  You must anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to take your place as prophet. 
<bqverse 17>17  Jehu will kill anyone who escapes Hazael's sword, and Elisha will kill anyone who escapes Jehu's sword. 
<bqverse 18>18  I still have left in Israel seven thousand followers who have not bowed their knees to Baal or kissed the images of him.<a name="fnB1059" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1059"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 19>19  Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve pairs of oxen; he was near the twelfth pair. Elijah passed by him and threw his robe over him. 
<bqverse 20>20  He left the oxen, ran after Elijah, and said, "Please let me kiss my father and mother goodbye, then I will follow you." Elijah<a name="fnB1060" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1060"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> said to him, "Go back! Indeed, what have I done to you?" 
<bqverse 21>21  Elisha<a name="fnB1061" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1061"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> went back and took his pair of oxen and slaughtered them. He cooked the meat over a fire that he made by burning the harness and yoke.<a name="fnB1062" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1062"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> He gave the people meat and they ate. Then he got up and followed Elijah and became his assistant.

<p><i>Ben Hadad Invades Israel</i>
<p><A NAME="20"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Now King Ben Hadad of Syria assembled all his army, along with thirty-two other kings with their horses and chariots. He marched against Samaria and besieged and attacked it.<a name="fnB1063" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1063"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  He sent messengers to King Ahab of Israel, who was in the city.<a name="fnB1064" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1064"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  He said to him, "This is what Ben Hadad says, `Your silver and your gold are mine, as well as the best of your wives and sons.'" 
<bqverse 4>4  The king of Israel replied, "It is just as you say, my master, O king. I and all I own belong to you."<p>

<bqverse 5>5  The messengers came again and said, "This is what Ben Hadad says, `I sent this message to you, "You must give me your silver, gold, wives, and sons." 
<bqverse 6>6  But now at this time tomorrow I will send my servants to you and they will search through your palace and your servants' houses. They will carry away all your valuables."<a name="fnB1065" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1065"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  The king of Israel summoned all the leaders<a name="fnB1066" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1066"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> of the land and said, "Notice how this man is looking for trouble.<a name="fnB1067" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1067"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> Indeed, he demanded my wives, sons, silver, and gold, and I did not resist him." 
<bqverse 8>8  All the leaders and people said to him, "Do not give in or agree to his demands."<a name="fnB1068" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1068"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  So he said to the messengers of Ben Hadad, "Say this to my master, the king, `I will give you everything you demanded at first from your servant, but I am unable to agree to this latest demand.'"<a name="fnB1069" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1069"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> So the messengers went back and gave their report.<p>

<bqverse 10>10  Ben Hadad sent another message to him, "May the gods judge me severely<a name="fnB1070" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1070"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> if there is enough dirt left in Samaria for my soldiers to scoop up in their hands."<a name="fnB1071" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1071"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  The king of Israel replied, "Tell him the one who puts on his battle gear should not boast like one who is taking it off."<a name="fnB1072" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1072"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  When Ben Hadad received this reply,<a name="fnB1073" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1073"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> he and the other kings were drinking in their quarters.<a name="fnB1074" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1074"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> He ordered his servants, "Get ready to attack!" So they got ready to attack the city.<a name="_Toc494011997"></a></p>
<p><i>The LORD Delivers Israel</i>
<p>
<bqverse 13>13  Now a prophet visited King Ahab of Israel and said, "This is what the LORD says, `Do you see this huge army?<a name="fnB1075" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1075"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> Look, I am going to hand it over to you this very day. Then you will know that I am the LORD.'" 
<bqverse 14>14  Ahab asked, "By whom will this be accomplished?"<a name="fnB1076" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1076"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> He answered, "This is what the LORD says, `By the servants of the district governors.'" Ahab<a name="fnB1077" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1077"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> asked, "Who will launch the attack?" He answered, "You will."<p>

<bqverse 15>15  So Ahab<a name="fnB1078" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1078"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> assembled the 232 servants of the district governors. After that he assembled all the Israelite army, numbering seven thousand.<a name="fnB1079" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1079"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  They marched out at noon, while Ben Hadad and the thirty-two kings allied with him were drinking heavily<a name="fnB1080" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1080"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> in their quarters.<a name="fnB1081" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1081"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  The servants of the district governors led the march. When Ben Hadad sent messengers, they reported back to him, "Men are marching out of Samaria." 
<bqverse 18>18  He ordered, "Whether they come in peace or to do battle, take them alive."<a name="fnB1082" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1082"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  They marched out of the city with the servants of the district governors in the lead and the army behind them. 
<bqverse 20>20  Each one struck down an enemy soldier;<a name="fnB1083" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1083"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> the Syrians fled and Israel chased them. King Ben Hadad of Syria escaped on horseback with some horsemen. 
<bqverse 21>21  Then the king of Israel marched out and struck down the horses and chariots; he thoroughly defeated<a name="fnB1084" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1084"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> Syria.<a name="_Toc494011998"></a></p>
<p><i>The LORD Gives Israel Another Victory</i>
<p>
<bqverse 22>22  The prophet<a name="fnB1085" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1085"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> visited the king of Israel and instructed him, "Go, fortify your defenses.<a name="fnB1086" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1086"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> Determine<a name="fnB1087" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1087"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> what you must do, for in the spring<a name="fnB1088" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1088"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> the king of Syria will attack<a name="fnB1089" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1089"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> you." 
<bqverse 23>23  Now the advisers<a name="fnB1090" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1090"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> of the king of Syria said to him: "Their God is a god of the mountains. That's why they overpowered us. But if we fight them in the plains, we will certainly overpower them. 
<bqverse 24>24  So do this: Dismiss the kings from their command, and replace them with military commanders. 
<bqverse 25>25  Muster an army like the one you lost, with the same number of horses and chariots.<a name="fnB1091" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1091"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> Then we will fight them in the plains; we will certainly overpower them." He approved their plan and did as they advised.<a name="fnB1092" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1092"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 26>26  In the spring<a name="fnB1093" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1093"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> Ben Hadad mustered the Syrian army<a name="fnB1094" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1094"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> and marched to Aphek to fight Israel.<a name="fnB1095" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1095"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  When the Israelites had mustered and had received their supplies, they marched out to face them in battle. When the Israelites deployed opposite them, they were like two small flocks<a name="fnB1096" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1096"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> of goats, but the Syrians filled the land. 
<bqverse 28>28  The prophet<a name="fnB1097" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1097"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> visited the king of Israel and said, "This is what the LORD says: `Because the Syrians said, "The LORD is a god of the mountains and not a god of the valleys," I will hand over to you this entire huge army.<a name="fnB1098" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1098"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> Then you will know that I am the LORD.'"<p>

<bqverse 29>29  The armies were deployed opposite each other for seven days. On the seventh day the battle began, and the Israelites killed one hundred thousand Syrian foot soldiers in one day. 
<bqverse 30>30  The remaining twenty-seven thousand ran to Aphek and went into the city, but the wall fell on them.<a name="fnB1099" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1099"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> Now Ben Hadad ran into the city and hid in an inner room.<a name="fnB1100" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1100"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 31>31  His advisers<a name="fnB1101" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1101"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> said to him, "Look, we have heard that the kings of the Israelite dynasty are kind.<a name="fnB1102" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1102"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> Allow us to put sackcloth around our waists and ropes on our heads<a name="fnB1103" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1103"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> and surrender<a name="fnB1104" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1104"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> to the king of Israel. Maybe he will spare our lives." 
<bqverse 32>32  So they put sackcloth around their waists and ropes on their heads and went to the king of Israel. They said, "Your servant<a name="fnB1105" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1105"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> Ben Hadad says, `Please let me live!'" Ahab<a name="fnB1106" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1106"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> replied, "Is he still alive? He is my brother."<a name="fnB1107" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 33>33  The men took this as a good omen and quickly accepted his offer, saying, "Ben Hadad is your brother." Ahab<a name="fnB1108" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1108"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> then said, "Go, get him." So Ben Hadad came out to him, and Ahab pulled him up into his chariot. 
<bqverse 34>34  Ben Hadad<a name="fnB1109" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1109"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> said, "I will return the cities my father took from your father. You may set up markets<a name="fnB1110" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> in Damascus, just as my father did in Samaria." Ahab then said, "I want to make a treaty with you before I dismiss you."<a name="fnB1111" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> So he made a treaty with him and then dismissed him.<a name="_Toc494011999"></a></p>
<p><i>A Prophet Denounces Ahab's Actions</i>
<p>
<bqverse 35>35  One of the members of the prophetic guild, speaking with divine authority, ordered his companion, "Wound me!"<a name="fnB1112" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1112"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> But the man refused to wound him. 
<bqverse 36>36  So the prophet<a name="fnB1113" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1113"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> said to him, "Because you have disobeyed the LORD, as soon as you leave me a lion will kill you." When he left him, a lion attacked and killed him. 
<bqverse 37>37  He found another man and said, "Wound me!" So the man wounded him severely.<a name="fnB1114" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1114"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 38>38  The prophet then went and stood by the road, waiting for the king. He also disguised himself by putting a bandage down over his eyes. 
<bqverse 39>39  When the king passed by, he called out to the king, "Your servant went out into the heat<a name="fnB1115" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1115"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> of the battle, and then a man turned aside and brought me a prisoner.<a name="fnB1116" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1116"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> He told me, `Guard this prisoner.

<bqverse 40>40  Well, it just so happened that while your servant was doing this and that, he disappeared."

<bqverse 41>41  The prophet<a name="fnB1121" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1121"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> quickly removed the bandage from his eyes and the king of Israel recognized he was one of the prophets. 
<bqverse 42>42  The prophet<a name="fnB1122" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1122"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> then said to him, "This is what the LORD says, `Because you released a man I had determined should die, you will pay with your life and your people will suffer instead of his people.'"<a name="fnB1123" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1123"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 43>43  The king of Israel went home to Samaria bitter and angry.

<bqverse 2>2  Ahab said to Naboth, "Give me your vineyard so I can make a vegetable garden out of it, for it is adjacent to my palace.

<bqverse 11>11  The men of the<a name="fnB1141" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1141"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> city, the leaders<a name="fnB1142" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1142"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> and the nobles who lived there,<a name="fnB1143" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1143"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> followed the written orders Jezebel had sent them.<a name="fnB1144" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1144"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  They observed a time of fasting and put Naboth in front of the people. 
<bqverse 13>13  The two villains arrived and sat opposite him. Then the villains testified against Naboth right before the people, saying, "Naboth cursed God and the king." So they dragged him<a name="fnB1145" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1145"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> outside the city and stoned him to death.<a name="fnB1146" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1146"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  Then they reported to Jezebel, "Naboth has been stoned to death."<a name="fnB1147" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1147"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 15>15  When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she<a name="fnB1148" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1148"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> said to Ahab, "Get up, take possession of the vineyard Naboth the Jezreelite refused to sell you for silver, for Naboth is no longer alive; he's dead." 
<bqverse 16>16  When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead,<a name="fnB1149" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1149"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> he got up and went down to take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.<p>

<bqverse 17>17  The LORD told Elijah the Tishbite:<a name="fnB1150" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1150"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  "Get up, go down and meet King Ahab of Israel who lives in Samaria. He is at the vineyard of Naboth; he has gone down there to take possession of it. 
<bqverse 19>19  Say to him, `This is what the LORD says: "Haven't you committed murder and taken possession of the property of the deceased?"' Then say to him, `This is what the LORD says: "In the spot where dogs licked up Naboth's blood they will also lick up your blood--yes, yours!"'"<p>

<bqverse 20>20  When Elijah arrived, Ahab said to him,<a name="fnB1151" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1151"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> "So, you have found me, my enemy!" Elijah<a name="fnB1152" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1152"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> replied, "I have found you, because you are committed<a name="fnB1153" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1153"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> to doing evil before<a name="fnB1154" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1154"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD. 
<bqverse 21>21  The LORD says,<a name="fnB1155" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1155"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> `Look, I am ready to bring disaster<a name="fnB1156" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1156"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> on you. I will destroy you<a name="fnB1157" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1157"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> and cut off every last male belonging to Ahab in Israel, including even the weak and incapacitated.<a name="fnB1158" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1158"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  I will make your dynasty<a name="fnB1159" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1159"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> like those of Jeroboam son of Nebat and Baasha son of Ahijah because you angered me and made Israel sin.'<a name="fnB1160" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1160"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23  The LORD says this about Jezebel, `Dogs will devour Jezebel by the outer wall<a name="fnB1161" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1161"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> of Jezreel.' 
<bqverse 24>24  As for Ahab's family, dogs will eat the ones<a name="fnB1162" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1162"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> who die in the city, and the birds of the sky will eat the ones who die in the country." 
<bqverse 25>25  (There had never been anyone like Ahab, who was firmly committed<a name="fnB1163" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1163"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> to doing evil before<a name="fnB1164" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1164"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD, urged on by his wife Jezebel.<a name="fnB1165" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1165"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  He was so wicked he worshiped the disgusting idols,<a name="fnB1166" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1166"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> just like the Amorites<a name="fnB1167" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1167"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> whom the LORD had driven out from before the Israelites.)<p>

<bqverse 27>27  When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and fasted. He slept in sackcloth and walked around dejected. 
<bqverse 28>28  The LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite,<a name="fnB1168" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1168"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 29>29  "Have you noticed how Ahab shows remorse<a name="fnB1169" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1169"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> before me? Because he shows remorse before me, I will not bring disaster on his dynasty during his lifetime, but during the reign of his son."<a name="fnB1170" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1170"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Ahab Dies in Battle</i>
<p><A NAME="22"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> There was no war between Syria and Israel for three years.<a name="fnB1171" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1171"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  In the third year King Jehoshaphat of Judah came down to visit<a name="fnB1172" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1172"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> the king of Israel. 
<bqverse 3>3  The king of Israel said to his servants, "Surely you recognize that Ramoth Gilead belongs to us, though we are hesitant to reclaim it from the king of Syria."<a name="fnB1173" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1173"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  Then he said to Jehoshaphat, "Will you go with me to attack Ramoth Gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, "I will support you; my army and horses are at your disposal."<a name="fnB1174" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1174"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  Then Jehoshaphat added,<a name="fnB1175" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1175"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> "First seek an oracle from the LORD."<a name="fnB1176" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1176"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  So the king of Israel assembled about four hundred prophets and asked them, "Should I attack Ramoth Gilead or not?"<a name="fnB1177" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1177"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> They said, "Attack! The sovereign one<a name="fnB1178" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1178"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> will hand it over to the king." 
<bqverse 7>7  But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there not a prophet of the LORD still here, that we may ask him?" 
<bqverse 8>8  The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, "There is still one man through whom we can seek the LORD's will.<a name="fnB1179" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1179"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> But I despise<a name="fnB1180" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1180"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> him because he does not prophesy prosperity for me, but disaster. His name is Micaiah son of Imlah.<a name="fnB1181" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1181"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> Jehoshaphat said, "The king should not say such things." 
<bqverse 9>9  The king of Israel summoned an official and said, "Quickly bring Micaiah son of Imlah." <p>

<bqverse 10>10  Now the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah were sitting on their respective thrones,<a name="fnB1182" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1182"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> dressed in their robes, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria. All the prophets were prophesying before them. 
<bqverse 11>11  Zedekiah son of Kenaanah made iron horns and said, "This is what the LORD says, `With these you will gore Syria until they are destroyed.'" 
<bqverse 12>12  All the prophets were prophesying the same, saying, "Attack Ramoth Gilead! You will succeed; the LORD will hand it over to the king." 
<bqverse 13>13  Now the messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, "Look, the prophets are in complete agreement that the king will succeed.<a name="fnB1183" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1183"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> Your words must agree with theirs; you must predict success."<a name="fnB1184" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1184"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  But Micaiah said, "As certainly as the LORD lives, I will say what the LORD tells me to say."<p>

<bqverse 15>15  When he came before the king, the king asked him, "Micaiah, should we attack Ramoth Gilead or not?" He answered him, "Attack! You will succeed; the LORD will hand it over to the king."<a name="fnB1185" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1185"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  The king said to him, "How many times must I make you solemnly promise in<a name="fnB1186" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1186"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> the name of the LORD to tell me only the truth?" 
<bqverse 17>17  Micaiah<a name="fnB1187" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1187"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> said, "I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains like sheep that have no shepherd. Then the LORD said, `They have no master. They should go home in peace.'" 
<bqverse 18>18  The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you he does not prophesy prosperity for me, but disaster?" 
<bqverse 19>19  Micaiah<a name="fnB1188" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1188"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> said, "That being the case, hear the word of the LORD. I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, with all the heavenly assembly standing on his right and on his left. 
<bqverse 20>20  The LORD said, `Who will deceive Ahab, so he will attack Ramoth Gilead and die<a name="fnB1189" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1189"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> there?' One said this and another that. 
<bqverse 21>21  Then a spirit<a name="fnB1190" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1190"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> stepped forward and stood before the LORD. He said, `I will deceive him.' The LORD asked him, `How?' 
<bqverse 22>22  He replied, `I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.' The LORD<a name="fnB1191" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1191"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> said, `Deceive and overpower him.<a name="fnB1192" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1192"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> Go out and do as you have proposed.' 
<bqverse 23>23  So now, look, the LORD has placed a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours; but the LORD has decreed disaster for you." 
<bqverse 24>24  Zedekiah son of Kenaanah approached, hit Micaiah on the jaw, and said, "Which way did the LORD's spirit go when he went from me to speak to you?" 
<bqverse 25>25  Micaiah replied, "Look, you will see in the day when you go into an inner room to hide." 
<bqverse 26>26  Then the king of Israel said, "Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the city official and Joash the king's son. 
<bqverse 27>27  Say, `This is what the king says, "Put this man in prison. Give him only a little bread and water<a name="fnB1193" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1193"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> until I safely return."'"<a name="fnB1194" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1194"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  Micaiah said, "If you really do safely return, then the LORD has not spoken through me." Then he added, "Take note,<a name="fnB1195" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1195"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> all you people."<p>

<bqverse 29>29  The king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah attacked Ramoth Gilead. 
<bqverse 30>30  The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and then enter<a name="fnB1196" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1196"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> into the battle; but you wear your robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and then entered into the battle. 
<bqverse 31>31  Now the king of Syria had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, "Do not fight common soldiers or high-ranking officers;<a name="fnB1197" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1197"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> fight only the king of Israel." 
<bqverse 32>32  When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, "He must be the king of Israel." So they turned and attacked him, but Jehoshaphat cried out. 
<bqverse 33>33  When the chariot commanders realized he was not the king of Israel, they turned away from him. 
<bqverse 34>34  Now an archer shot an arrow at random,<a name="fnB1198" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1198"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> and it struck the king of Israel between the plates of his armor. The king<a name="fnB1199" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1199"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> ordered his charioteer, "Turn around and take me from the battle line,<a name="fnB1200" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1200"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> because I'm wounded." 
<bqverse 35>35  While the battle raged throughout the day, the king stood propped up in his chariot opposite the Syrians. He died in the evening; the blood from the wound ran down into the bottom of the chariot. 
<bqverse 36>36  As the sun was setting, a cry went through the camp, "Each one should return to his city and to his homeland." 
<bqverse 37>37  So the king died and was taken to Samaria, where they buried him.<a name="fnB1201" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1201"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 38>38  They washed off the chariot at the pool of Samaria; dogs licked his blood (this was where the prostitutes bathed),<a name="fnB1202" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1202"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> just as the LORD had said would happen.<a name="fnB1203" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1203"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 39>39  The rest of the events of Ahab's reign, including a record of his accomplishments and how he built a luxurious palace and various cities, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.<a name="fnB1204" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1204"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 40>40  Ahab passed away.<a name="fnB1205" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1205"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> His son Ahaziah replaced him as king.<a name="_Toc494012002"></a></p>
<p><i>Jehoshaphat's Reign over Judah</i>
<p>
<bqverse 41>41  In the fourth year of King Ahab's reign over Israel, Asa's son Jehoshaphat became king over Judah. 
<bqverse 42>42  Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king and he reigned for twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi. 
<bqverse 43>43  He followed in his father Asa's footsteps and was careful to do what the LORD approved.<a name="fnB1206" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1206"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a><i>(22.44)</i><a name="fnB1207" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1207"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> However, the high places were not eliminated; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense on the high places. 
<bqverse 44>44 <i>(22.45)</i>Jehoshaphat was also at peace with the king of Israel.<p>

<bqverse 45>45  The rest of the events of Jehoshaphat's reign, including his successes and military exploits, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah.<a name="fnB1208" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1208"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 46>46  He removed from the land any male cultic prostitutes who had managed to survive the reign of his father Asa.<a name="fnB1209" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1209"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 47>47  There was no king in Edom at this time; a governor ruled. 
<bqverse 48>48  Jehoshaphat built a fleet of large ships<a name="fnB1210" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1210"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> to travel to Ophir for gold, but they never made the voyage because they were shipwrecked in Ezion Geber. 
<bqverse 49>49  Then Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, "Let my sailors join yours in the fleet,"<a name="fnB1211" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1211"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> but Jehoshaphat refused.<p>

<bqverse 50>50  Jehoshaphat passed away<a name="fnB1212" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1212"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> and was buried with his ancestors in the city of his ancestor<a name="fnB1213" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1213"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> David. His son Jehoram replaced him as king.<a name="_Toc494012003"></a></p>
<p><i>Ahaziah's Reign over Israel</i>
<p>
<bqverse 51>51  In the seventeenth year of King Jehoshaphat's reign over Judah, Ahab's son Ahaziah became king over Israel in Samaria. He ruled for two years over Israel. 
<bqverse 52>52  He did evil before<a name="fnB1214" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1214"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD and followed in the footsteps<a name="fnB1215" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1215"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> of his father and mother; like Jeroboam son of Nebat, he encouraged Israel to sin.<a name="fnB1216" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1216"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 53>53  He worshiped and bowed down to Baal,<a name="fnB1217" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1217"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> angering the LORD God of Israel just as his father had done.<a name="fnB1218" href="1ki_note.htm#fn1218"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a></p>
