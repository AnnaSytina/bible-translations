 <b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Heb</i> "And he (the LORD) called (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ar&#180;q=Y]w~</FONT>) to Moses and the LORD spoke (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rB@d^y+w~</FONT>) to him from the tent of meeting." The MT assumes "LORD" in the first clause but places it in the second clause (after "spoke"). This seems awkward. The Syriac version places "LORD" in the first clause (right after "called").<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:1)  The best explanation for the MT of Lev 1:1 arises from its function as a transition from Exod 40 to Lev 1. The first clause, "And he (the LORD) called to Moses," links v. 1 back to Exod 40:35, "But Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it and the glory of the LORD had filled the tabernacle" (cf. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 134). Exod 40:36-38 is a parenthetical explanation of the ongoing function of the cloud in leading the people through the wilderness. Since Moses could not enter the tent of meeting, the LORD "called" to him "from" the tent of meeting.<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="lev.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:1)  The second clause of v. 1, "and the LORD spoke to him from the tent of meeting, saying," introduces the following discourse. This is a standard introductory formula (see, e.g., Exod 20:1; 25:1; 31:1; etc.). The combination of the first and second clauses is, therefore, "bulky" because of the way they happen to be juxtaposed in this transitional verse (Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 8). The first clause of v. 1 connects the book back to the end of the Book of Exodus while the second looks forward the ritual legislation that follows in Lev 1:2ff. There are two "Tents of Meeting": the one that stood outside the camp (see, e.g., Exod 33:7) and the one that stood in the midst of the camp (Exod 40:2; Num 2:2ff) and served as the LORD's residence until the construction of the temple in the days of Solomon (Exod 27:21; 29:4; 1 Kgs 8:4; 2 Chr 5:5, etc.; cf. 2 Sam 7:6). Exod 40:35 uses both "tabernacle" and "tent of meeting" to refer to the same tent: "Moses could not enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle." It is clear that "tent of meeting" in Lev 1:1 refers to the "tabernacle." The latter term refers to the tent as a "residence," while the former refers to it as a divinely appointed place of "meeting" between God and man (see <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:873-77 and 2:1130-34). This corresponds to the change in terms in Exod 40:35, where "tent of meeting" is used when referring to Moses' inability to enter the tent, but "tabernacle" when referring to the LORD taking up residence there in the form of the glory cloud. The quotation introduced here extends from Lev 1:2 through 3:17, and encompasses the burnt, grain, and peace offering regulations. Compare the notes on Lev 4:1; 5:14; and 6:1 [5:20 HT] below.<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="lev.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  "When" here translates the MT's<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> yK!</FONT> ("if; when"), which regularly introduces main clauses in legislative contexts (see, e.g., Lev 2:1, 4; 4:2, etc.) in contrast to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;a! </FONT>"if," which usually introduces subordinate sections (see, e.g., Lev 1:3, 10, 14; 2:5, 7, 14; 4:3, 13, etc.; cf. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK! </FONT>in Exod 21:2 and 7 as opposed to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;a! </FONT>in vv. 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 11).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:2)  Lev 1:1-2 serves as a heading for Lev 1-3 (i.e., the basic regulations regarding the presentation of the burnt, grain, and peace offerings) and, at the same time, leads directly into the section on "burnt offerings" in Lev 1:3. In turn, Lev 1:3-17 divides into three subsections, all introduced by <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;a! </FONT>"if" (Lev 1:3-9, 10-13, and 14-17, respectively). Similar patterns are discernible throughout Lev 1:2-6:7 [5:26 HT].<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="lev.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  Literally, "a man, human being" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;d*a*</FONT>), which in this case refers to any person among "mankind," male or female, since women could also bring such offerings (see, e.g., Lev 12:6-8; 15:29-30; cf. <i>HALOT</i> 14).<br>
 <a name="fn4" href="lev.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  The verb "presents" is cognate to the noun "offering" in v. 2 and throughout the book of Leviticus (both from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">brq</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">qrB</FONT>]). One could translate the verb "offers," but this becomes awkward and, in fact, inaccurate in some passages. For example, in Lev. 9:9 this verb is used for the presenting or giving of the blood to Aaron so that he could offer it to the LORD. The blood is certainly not being "offered" as an offering to Aaron there.<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="lev.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  The whole clause reads more literally, "A human being [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;d&#180;a*</FONT>], if he brings from among you an offering to the LORD."<br>
 <a name="fn6" href="lev.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  The shift to the second person plural verb here corresponds to the previous second person plural pronoun "among <i>you</i>." It is distinct from the regular pattern of third person singular verbs throughout the rest of Lev 1-3. This too labels Lev 1:1-2 as an introduction to all of Lev 1-3, not just the burnt offering regulations in Lev 1 (Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 146; cf. note 3 above).<br>
 <a name="fn7" href="lev.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  <i>Heb</i> "from the domesticated animal, from the herd, and from the flock."<br>
 <b>sn </b> (1:2) It is clear from the subsequent division between animals from the "herd" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rq*B*</FONT> in Lev 1:3-9) and the "flock" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/aX)</FONT> in Lev 1:10-13), that the term for "domesticated animal" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*h@B=</FONT>) is a general term meant to introduce the category of pastoral quadrupeds. The stronger disjunctive accent over <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*h@B= </FONT>in the MT as well as the lack of a <i>vav </i>between it and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rq*B* </FONT>also suggest <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*h@B= </FONT>is an overall category that includes both "herd" and "flock" quadrupeds. The bird category (Lev 1:14-17) is not included in this introduction because bird offerings were, by and large, concessions to the poor (cf., e.g., Lev 5:7-10; 12:8; 14:21-32) and, therefore, not considered to be one of the primary categories of animal offerings.<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="lev.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:3)  The burnt offering (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hl*u)</FONT>) was basically a "a gift of a soothing aroma to the LORD" (vv. 9, 13, 17). It could serve as a votive or freewill offering (e.g., Lev 22:18-20), an accompaniment of prayer and supplication (e.g., 1 Sam 7:9-10), part of the regular daily, weekly, monthly, and festival cultic pattern (e.g., Num 28-29), or to make atonement either alone (e.g., Lev 1:4; 16:24) or in combination with the grain offering (e.g., Lev 14:20) or sin offering (e.g., Lev 5:7; 9:7). See <i>NIDOTTE</i> 4:996-1022.<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="lev.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  The NIV correctly has "it" in the text, referring to the acceptance of the animal (cf. e.g., RSV, NEB, NASB), but "he" in the margin, referring to the acceptance of the offerer (cf. NRSV, JB). The reference to a "flawless male" in the first half of this verse suggests that the issue here is the acceptability of the animal to make atonement <i>on behalf of </i>the offerer (Lev 1:4).<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="lev.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:4)  "To make atonement" is the standard translation of the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rP#K!</FONT>.<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> </FONT>The English word derives from a combination of "at" plus Middle English "one[ment]," referring primarily to reconciliation or reparation that is made in order to accomplish reconciliation. The primary meaning of the Hebrew verb, however, is "to wipe [something off (or, on)]" (see esp. the goal of the sin offering, Lev 4, "to purge" the tabernacle from impurities), but in some cases it refers metaphorically to "wiping away" anything that might stand in the way of good relations by bringing a gift (see, e.g., Gen 32:20 [21 HT], "to appease; to pacify" as an illustration of this). The translation "make atonement" has been retained here because, ultimately, the goal of either purging or appeasing was to maintain a proper relationship between the LORD (who dwelt in the tabernacle) and Israelites in whose midst the tabernacle was pitched (see <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:689-710 for a full discussion of the Hebrew word meaning "to make atonement" and its theological significance).<br>
 <a name="fn11" href="lev.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Heb</i> "Then he"; the referent (the offerer) has been specified in the translation for clarity. The LXX has "they" rather than "he," suggesting that the priests, not the offerer, were to slaughter the bull (cf. the notes on vv. 6a and 9a).<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="lev.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Heb</i> "the son of the herd."<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="lev.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  "Splash" or "dash" is better than "sprinkle," which is the common English translation of this verb (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qr~z&#180;</FONT>; see, e.g., NIV). "Sprinkle" is not strong enough (contrast <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hz&#180;n&#180;</FONT>, which does indeed mean "to sprinkle" or "to splatter"; cf. Lev 4:6).<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="lev.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  <i>Heb</i> "Then he"; the referent (the offerer) has been specified in the translation for clarity. The LXX and the Samaritan Pentateuch have "they" rather than "he" in both halves of this verse, suggesting that the priests not the offerer were to skin and cut the carcass of the bull into pieces (cf. the notes on vv. 5a and 9a).<br>
 <a name="fn15" href="lev.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:7)  A few Hebrew MSS, the Samaritan Pentateuch, LXX, Syriac, and <i>Tg. Onq. </i>have plural "priests" here (cf. 1:5, 8) rather than the MT singular "priest." The MS evidence for the plural is strong and has been followed here, but it is possible that one should read "priest" meaning (1) Aaron, the (high) priest, or (2) the officiating priest, as in Lev 1:9 (cf. 6:10 [3 HT], etc.), and consider "the sons of Aaron" to be a textual corruption caused by conflation with Lev 1:5, 8 (cf. the remarks in Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 13).<br>
 <a name="fn16" href="lev.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:8)  A few Hebrew MSS, the Samaritan Pentateuch, LXX, Syriac, and <i>Tg.

Once again, the MT assigns the preparation of the offering (here the entrails and legs) to the offerer because it did not bring him into direct contact with the altar, but reserves the actual placing on the altar for the officiating priest (cf. the notes on vv. 5a and 6a).<br>
 <a name="fn19" href="lev.htm#fnB19"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  <i>Heb</i> "toward the altar," but the so-called locative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">h</FONT> attached to the word for "altar" can indicate the place where something is or happens (GKC &#167;90.<i>d</i> and &#167;118.<i>g</i>; cf. also Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 161). This is a standard way of expressing "on/at the altar" with the verb "to offer up in smoke" (Hiphil of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rfq</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">qfr</FONT>; cf. also Exod 29:13, 18, 25; Lev 1:9, 13, 15, 17; 2:2, etc.).<br>
 <a name="fn20" href="lev.htm#fnB20"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:9)  A few Hebrew MSS and possibly the Leningrad B19a MS itself (the basis of the <i>BHS</i> Hebrew text of the MT), under an apparent erasure, plus the Samaritan Pentateuch, LXX, Syriac, and <i>Tg. Ps.-J.</i> suggest that Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aWh</FONT> (rendered "it is") should be added here as in vv. 13 and 17. Whether or not the text should be changed, the meaning is the same as in vv. 13 and 17, so it has been included in the translation here.<br>
 <a name="fn21" href="lev.htm#fnB21"><sup>22</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:9)  The standard English translation of "gift" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hV#a!</FONT>) is "an offering [made] by fire." It is based on a supposed etymological relationship to the Hebrew word for "fire" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">va@</FONT>) and is still maintained in many versions (e.g., NIV, RSV, NRSV; Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 7-8). For various reasons, including the fact that some offerings referred to by this term are not burned on the altar (see, e.g., Lev 24:9), it is probably better to understand the term to mean "gift" (Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 22) or "food gift" ("food offering" in NEB and TEV; Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 161-162).

 <a name="fn27" href="lev.htm#fnB27"><sup>28</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:15)  The action here seems to involve both a twisting action, breaking the neck of the bird and severing its vertebrae, as well as pinching or nipping the skin to severe the head from the main body.<br>

 <a name="fn30" href="lev.htm#fnB30"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:16)  This translation ("set aside its entrails by [cutting off] its tail wing") is based on Milgrom's discussion in <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB],<i> </i>169-171, although he translates, "remove its crissum by its feathers." Others possibilities include "its crop with its contents" (<i>Targum Onqelos</i>, NIV, NRSV; Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i>, 23) or "its crop with its feathers" (LXX, NASB, RSV; "crop" refers to the enlarged part of a bird's gullet that serves a pouch for the preliminary maceration of food).<br>
 <a name="fn31" href="lev.htm#fnB31"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:16)  The pronoun "them" here is feminine singular in Hebrew and refers collectively to the entrails and tail wing which have been removed.<br>

Num 15:1-10), thus completing the food "gift" to the LORD. It made atonement (see the note on Lev 1:4) along with the burnt offering (e.g., Lev 14:20) or alone as a sin offering for the poor (Lev 5:11-13).<br>
 <a name="fn34" href="lev.htm#fnB34"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:1)  The Hebrew term for "choice wheat flour" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tl#s)</FONT>) is often translated "fine flour," but it refers specifically to wheat as opposed to barley (Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 10). Moreover, the translation "flour" might be problematic, since the Hebrew term may designate the "grits" rather than the more finely ground "flour" (see Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 179 as opposed Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 10 and Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 30).<br>

It was probably intended to call to mind (i.e., memorialize) before the LORD the reason for the presentation of the particular offering (see the remarks in <i>NIDOTTE</i> 1:335-39).<br>

The LXX seems to suggest adding a <i>vav</i> ("and") and pointing the verb as a consecutive perfect, which yields "and you shall break it in pieces" (cf. the <i>BHS</i> textual note; Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 26 prefers the LXX).<br>

 <a name="fn50" href="lev.htm#fnB50"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tc</b> (2:8)  There are several person, gender, and voice verb problems in this verse. First, the MT has "And you shall bring the grain offering," but the LXX and Qumran have "he" rather than "you" (Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 185). Second, the MT has "which shall be made" (i.e., the 3rd person masc. Niphal passive verb which, in fact, does not agree with its fem. subject, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hj*n+m! </FONT>"grain offering"), while the LXX has "which he shall make" (3rd person Qal), thus agreeing with the LXX 3rd person verb at the beginning of the verse (see above). Third, the MT has a 3rd person <i>vav</i> consecutive verb "and he shall present it to the priest," which agrees with the LXX but is not internally consistent with the 2nd person verb at the beginning of the verse in the MT. The <i>BHS</i> editors conjecture that the latter might be repointed to an imperative verb yielding "present it to the priest." This would require no change of consonants and corresponds to the person of the first verb in the MT. This solution has been tentatively accepted here (cf. also Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 26-27), even though it neither resolves the gender problem of the second verb nor fits the general grammatical pattern of the chapter in the MT.<br>

Theoretically, it could describe one, two, or three different ways of preparing first ripe grain offerings (Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 27). The translation here takes it as a description of only one kind of prepared grain. This is suggested by the fact that v. 16 uses only one term "crushed bits" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">cr\G\</FONT>) to refer back to the grain as it is prepared in v. 14 (a more technical translation is "groats," Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 178, 194).<br>

This was illustrated by the fact that the fat parts of the animal were consumed on the altar of the LORD but the meat was consumed by the worshipers in a meal before God. This is the only kind of offering in which common worshipers partook of the meat of the animal. When there was a series of offerings that includes a peace offering (see, e.g., Lev 9:8-21, sin offerings, burnt offerings, and afterward the peace offerings in vv. 18-21), the peace offering was always offered last because it expressed the fact that all was well between God and his worshiper(s). There were various kinds of peace offerings, depending on the worship intended on the specific occasion. The "thank offering" expressed thanksgiving (e.g., Lev 7:11-15; 22:29-30), the "votive offering" fulfilled a vow (e.g., Lev 7:16-18; 22:21-25), and the "freewill offering" was offered as an expression of devotion and praise to God (e.g., Lev 7:16-18; 22:21-25). The so-called "ordination offering" was also a kind of peace offering that was used to consecrate the priests at their ordination (e.g., Exod 29:19-34; Lev 7:37; 8:22-32).

 <a name="fn77" href="lev.htm#fnB77"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:2)  <i>Heb</i> "And a person, when he sins in straying."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (4:2)  The English translation of "by straying" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hg&#180;g&#180;v=B!</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">B!vg~g~h</FONT>] literally, "in going astray; in making an error") varies greatly, but almost all suggest that this term refers to sins that were committed by mistake or done not knowing that the particular act was sinful (Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 228-229). See, e.g., LXX "involuntarily"; <i>Tg. Onq. </i>"by neglect"; KJV "through ignorance"; RSV, NJPS "unwittingly"; NIV, NASB, NRSV "unintentionally"; NAB, NEB "inadvertently"; etc. However, we know from Num 15:27-31 that committing a sin "by straying" is the opposite of committing a sin "defiantly" (i.e., <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*r&#180; dy~B=</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">B=y~d r*m*h</FONT>] "with a raised hand," v. 30). In the latter case the person, as it were, raises his fist in presumptuous defiance against the LORD. Thus, he "blasphemes" the LORD and has "despised" his word, for which he should be "cut off from among his people" (Num 15:30-31). One could not bring an offering for such a sin. The expression here in Lev 4:2 combines "by straying" with the preposition "from" which fits naturally with "straying" (i.e., "straying from" the LORD's commandments). For sins committed "by straying" from the commandments (Lev 4 throughout) or other types of transgressions (Lev 5:1-6) there was indeed forgiveness available through the sin offering. See <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:94-95.<br>
 <a name="fn78" href="lev.htm#fnB78"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:2)  The "when" clause (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> in Hebrew) breaks off here before its resolution, thus creating an open ended introduction to the following subsections, which are introduced by "if" (Heb. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;a! </FONT>vv. 3, 13, 27, 32).

 <a name="fn81" href="lev.htm#fnB81"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:3)  The word for "sin offering" (sometimes translated "purification offering") is the same as the word for "sin" earlier in the verse. One can tell which rendering is intended only by the context. The primary purpose of the "sin offering" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">taF*j^</FONT>) was to "purge" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rP#K! </FONT>"to make atonement," see 4:20, 26, 31, 35, and the notes on Lev 1:4 and esp. Lev 16:20, 33) the sanctuary or its furniture in order to cleanse it from any impurities and/or (re)consecrate it for holy purposes (see, e.g., Lev 8:15; 16:19). By making this atonement the impurities of the person or community were cleansed and the people became clean. See <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:93-103.<br>

 <a name="fn141" href="lev.htm#fnB141"><sup>8</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:2)  Lev 5:2-3 are parallel laws of uncleanness (contracted from animals and people, respectively), and both seem to assume that the contraction of uncleanness was originally unknown to the person (vv. 2 and 3) but became known to him or her at a later time (v. 3; i.e., "has come to know" in v. 3 is to be assumed for v. 2 as well). Uncleanness itself did not make a person "guilty" unless he or she failed to handle it according to the normal purification regulations (see, e.g., "wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean till evening," Lev 15:5 NIV; cf. Lev 11:39-40; 15:5-12, 16-24; Num 19, etc.). The problem here in Lev. 5:2-3 is that, because the person had not been aware of his or her uncleanness, he or she had incurred guilt for not carrying out these regular procedures, and it would now be too late for that. Thus, the unclean person needs to bring a sin offering to atone for the contamination caused by his or her neglect of the purity regulations. <br>

The sin offering deals with violations of "any of the commandments," whereas the guilt offering focuses specifically on violations of regulations regarding "holy things" (i.e., things that have been consecrated to the LORD; see the full discussion in Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 320-327). <br>

It was closely associated with reconsecration of the LORD's sacred things or his sacred people (see, e.g., Lev 14:12-18; Num 6:11b-12). Moreover, there was usually an associated reparation made for the trespass, including restitution of that which was violated plus one fifth of its value as a fine (Lev 5:16; 6:5 [5:24 HT]).

Another possibility is that it refers to a situation where a person suspects that he violated something although he does not recollect it.

First, the verb "presented" appears to be in the perfect rather than the infinitive (but see GKC &#167;53l), the latter being normal in such temporal expressions. Second, the active verb form appears to be used as a passive plural ("they were presented"). However, if it is translated active and singular then Moses would the subject: "on the day he [Moses] offered them [Aaron and his sons]."<br>

 <a name="fn284" href="lev.htm#fnB284"><sup>49</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:37)  The inclusion of the "ordination offering" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ya!WLm!</FONT>; the term apparently comes from the notion of "filling [of the hand]," cf. Lev 8:33) here anticipates Lev 8. It is a kind of peace offering, as the regulations in Lev 8:22-32 will show (cf. Exod 29:19-34). In the context of the ordination ritual for the priests it fit into the sequence of offerings as a peace offering would: sin offering (Lev 8:14-17), burnt and grain offering (Lev 8:18-21), and finally peace (i.e., ordination) offering (Lev 8:22-32). Moreover, in this case, Moses received the breast of the ordination offering as his due since he was the presiding priest over the sacrificial procedures (Lev 8:29; cf. Lev 7:30-31), while Aaron and his sons ate the portions that would have been consumed by the common worshipers in a regular peace offering procedure (Exod 29:31-34; cf. Lev 7:15-18). For a general introduction to the peace offering see the note on Lev 3:1.<br>

It had twelve stones attached to it (representing the twelve tribes of Israel), and a pocket in which the Urim and Thummim were kept (see following).<br>
 <a name="fn296" href="lev.htm#fnB296"><sup>12</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:8)  The <i>Urim and Thummim</i> were two small objects used in the casting of lots to discern the will of God (see Exod 28:30; Num 27:21; Deut 33:8; 1 Sam 14:41 in the LXX and 28:6; Ezra 2:63 and Neh 7:65). It appears that by casting them one could obtain a yes or no answer, or no answer at all (1 Sam 28:6; Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 111-112).

This was a particularly important article of high priestly clothing in that it served as the main emblem indicating Aaron's acceptable representation of Israel before the LORD (Exod 28:38).<br>
 <a name="fn299" href="lev.htm#fnB299"><sup>15</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:10)  The expression "and consecrated it" refers to the effect of the anointing earlier in the verse (cf.

"To consecrate" means "to make holy" or "make sacred"; i.e., put something into the category of holy/sacred as opposed to common/profane (see Lev 10:10 below).

 <b>sn </b> (8:13) Notice that the priestly garments of Aaron's sons are quite limited compared to those of Aaron himself, the high priest (cf. vv. 7-9 above). The terms for "tunic" and "sash" are the same but not the headgear (cf. Exod 28:40; 29:8-9; 39:27-29).<br>
 <a name="fn302" href="lev.htm#fnB302"><sup>18</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:14)  See Lev 4:3-12 above for the sin offering of the priests. In this case, however, the blood manipulation is different because Moses, not Aaron (and his sons), is functioning as the priest. On the one hand, Aaron and his sons are, in a sense, treated as if they were commoners so that the blood manipulation took place at the burnt offering altar in the court of the tabernacle (see v. 15 below), not at the incense altar inside the tabernacle tent itself (contrast Lev 4:5-7 and compare 4:30). On the other hand, since it was a sin offering for the priests, therefore, the priests themselves could not eat its flesh (Lev 4:11-12; 6:30 [23 HT]), which was the normal priestly practice for sin offerings of commoners (Lev 6:26[19], 29[22]).<br>
 <a name="fn303" href="lev.htm#fnB303"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:15)  Contrary to some English translations (e.g., NASB, NIV), Aaron (<i>not</i> Moses) most likely slaughtered the bull, possibly with the help of his sons, although the verb is singular, not plural. Moses then performed the ritual procedures that involved direct contact with the altar. Compare the pattern in Lev 1:5-9, where the offerer does the slaughtering and the priests perform the procedures that involve direct contact with the altar. In Lev 8 Moses is functioning as the priest in order to consecrate the priesthood. The explicit reintroduction of the name of Moses as the subject of the next verb seems to reinforce this understanding of the passage (cf. also vv. 19 and 23 below).<br>

 <b>sn </b> (8:33) It is apparent that the term for "ordination offering" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ya!L%m!</FONT>; cf.

Some derive the terminology from the procedure in Lev 8:27-28, but the term for "hands" there is actually "palms." It seems more likely that it derives from the notion of putting the priestly responsibilities (or possibly its associated prebends) under their control (i.e., "filling their hands" with authority; see Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 538-539). The command "to keep the charge of the LORD" in v. 35 and the expression "by the hand of Moses" (i.e., under the authoritative hand of Moses, v. 36) may also support this interpretation.<br>

Many commentaries follow the LXX here (e.g., Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 578 and Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 118), but others argue that, as on the Day of Atonement (Lev 16), the offerings of the priests also effected the people, even though there was still the need to have special offerings made on behalf of the people as reflected in the second half of the verse (e.g., Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 56).<br>

See the notes on Lev 8:14-15.<br>

The distinction between this verb and "presented" in v. 9 above (see the note there) is that in v. 9 Aaron's sons held the bowl while Aaron manipulated some of the blood at the altar, while here in v. 12 they simply handed the bowl to him so he could splash all the blood around on the altar (Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 581).<br>

 <a name="fn349" href="lev.htm#fnB349"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:16)  The term "standard regulation" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">fP*v=m!</FONT>) here refers to the set of regulations for burnt offering goats in Lev 1:10-13.<br>
 <a name="fn350" href="lev.htm#fnB350"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:17)  The latter part of the verse ("in addition to the morning burnt offering") refers to the complex of morning (and evening) burnt and grain offerings that was the daily regulation for the tabernacle from the time of its erection (Exod 40:29). The regulations for it were appended to the end of the section of priestly consecration regulations in Exod 29 (see Exod 29:38-40) precisely because they were to be maintained throughout the priestly consecration period and beyond (Lev 8:33-36). Thus, the morning burnt and grain offerings would already have been placed on the altar before the inaugural burnt and grain offerings referred to here.<br>

 <a name="fn355" href="lev.htm#fnB355"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:24) <i>Heb</i> "from to the faces of the LORD." The rendering here is based on the use of "my faces" and "your faces" referring to the very "presence" of the LORD in Exod 33:14-15. <br>

Many translations and commentaries render here "shouted for joy" or "shouted joyfully," but the fact the people "feel on their faces" immediately afterward suggests that they were frightened as, for example, in Exod 19:16b; 20:18-21.<br>
 <a name="fn357" href="lev.htm#fnB357"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:1)  Although it has been used elsewhere in this translation as an English variation from the ubiquitous use of <i>vav </i>in Hebrew, in this instance "then" as a rendering for <i>vav </i>is intended to show that the Nadab and Abihu catastrophe took place on the inauguration day described in Lev 9. The tragic incident in Lev 10 happened in close temporal connection to the LORD's fire that consumed the offerings at the end of Lev 9. Thus, for example, the "sin offering" male goat referred to in Lev 10:16-19 is the very one referred to in Lev 9:15.<br>
 <a name="fn358" href="lev.htm#fnB358"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:1)  The expression "strange fire" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hr&#180;z&#180; va@</FONT>) seems imprecise and has been interpreted numerous ways (see the helpful summary in Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC] 132-133). The infraction may have involved any of the following or a combination thereof: (1) using coals from someplace other than the burnt offering altar (i.e., "unauthorized coals" according to Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 598; cf. Lev 16:12 and cf. "unauthorized person" <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rz&#180; vya! </FONT>in Num 16:40 [17:5 HT], NASB "layman"), (2) using the wrong kind of incense (cf. the Exod 30:9 regulation against "strange incense" <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hr&#180;z&#180; tr#f)q= </FONT>on the incense altar and the possible connection to Exod 30:34-38), (3) performing an incense offering at an unprescribed time (Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 59), or (4) entering the Holy of Holies at an inappropriate time (Lev 16:1-2).<br>

 <a name="fn360" href="lev.htm#fnB360"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:3)  The Niphal verb of the Hebrew root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vdq</FONT> can mean either "to be treated as holy" (so here, e.g., BDB 873, LXX, NASB, and NEB) or "to show oneself holy" (so here, e.g., <i>HALOT</i> 1073 [b], NIV, NRSV; Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 595, 601-603; and Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 133-134). The latter rendering seems more likely here since, in the immediate context, the LORD himself had indeed shown himself to be holy by the way he responded to the illegitimate incense offering of Nadab and Abihu. They had not treated the LORD as holy, so the LORD acted on his own behalf to show that he was indeed holy. <br>
 <a name="fn361" href="lev.htm#fnB361"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:3)  In this context the Niphal of the Hebrew root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dbk</FONT> can mean "to be honored" (e.g., NASB and NIV here), "be glorified" (NRSV here), or "glorify oneself, show one's glory" (e.g., specifically in this verse <i>HALOT</i> 455 [b]; Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 595, 603-604; and Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 126, 134). Comparing this clause with the previous one (see the note above), the point may be that when the LORD shows himself to be holy as he has done in 10:1-2, this results in him being honored (i.e., reverenced, feared, treated with respect) among the people. This suggests the passive rendering. It is possible, however, that one should use the reflexive rendering here as in the previous clause. If so, the passage means that the LORD showed both his holiness and his glory in one outbreak against Nadab and Abihu. <br>
 <a name="fn362" href="lev.htm#fnB362"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tc</b> (10:6)  The Samaritan Pentateuch has "you must not" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aO</FONT>) rather than the MT's "do not" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la^</FONT>; cf. the following negative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aO</FONT> in the MT).<br>

 <a name="fn365" href="lev.htm#fnB365"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:9)  The Hebrew grammar here suggests that the last portion of v. 9 (literally, "a perpetual statute for your generations") functions as both a conclusion to v. 9 and an introduction to vv. 10-11. It is a pivot clause, as it were. Thus, it was a "perpetual statute" to not drink alcoholic beverages when ministering in the tabernacle, but it was also a "perpetual statue" to distinguish between holy and profane and unclean and clean (v. 10) as well as to teach the children Israel all such statutes (v. 11).<br>

 <a name="fn367" href="lev.htm#fnB367"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:10)  The two pairs of categories in this verse refer to: (1) the <i>status</i> of a person, place, thing, or time--"holy" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vd\q)</FONT>) versus "common" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lj)</FONT>); as opposed to (2) the <i>condition</i> of a person, place, or thing--"unclean" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">am@f*</FONT>) versus "clean" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rohf*</FONT>). Someone or something could gain "holy" <i>status</i> by being "consecrated" (i.e., made holy; e.g., the Hebrew Piel <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vD}q! </FONT>in Lev 8:15, 30), and to treat someone or something that was holy as if it were "common" would be to "profane" that person or thing (the Hebrew Piel <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lL@h!</FONT>, e.g., in Lev 19:29 and 22:15). Similarly, on another level, someone or something could be in a "clean" <i>condition</i>, but one could "defile" (the Hebrew Piel <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aM@f!</FONT>, e.g.,<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> </FONT>in Gen 34:5 and Num 6:9) that person or thing and thereby make it "unclean." To "purify" (the Hebrew Piel <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rh@f!</FONT>, e.g., in Lev 16:19 and Num 8:6, 15) that unclean person or thing would be to make it "clean" once again. With regard to the animals (Lev 11), some were by nature "unclean," so they could never be eaten, but others were by nature "clean" and, therefore, edible (Lev 11:2, 46-47). The meat of clean animals could become inedible by too long of a delay in eating it, in which case the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lWGP! </FONT>"foul, spoiled" is used to describe it (Lev 7:18; 19:7; cf. also Ezek 4:14 and Isa 65:4), not the term for "unclean" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rohf*</FONT>).

Based on Lev 15:2-3, one could argue that the Hebrew word for "flesh" here (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rc*B*</FONT>) is euphemistic for the male genital member and therefore translate "the foreskin of his member" (see, e.g., Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 748).<br>

 <a name="fn432" href="lev.htm#fnB432"><sup>8</sup></a><b>sn</b> (12:4)  The initial seven days after the birth of a son were days of blood <i>impurity</i> for the woman as if she was on her menstrual period. Her impurity was contagious during this period, so no one should touch her or even furniture on which she has sat or reclined (Lev 15:19-23), lest they too become impure. Even her husband would become impure for seven days if he had sexual relations with her during this time (Lev 15:24; cf. 18:19). The next thirty-three days were either "days of purification, purifying" or "days of purity," depending on how one understands the abstract noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hr&#180;h(f) </FONT>"purification; purity" in this context. During this time the woman could not touch anything holy or enter the sanctuary, but she was no longer contagious like she had been during the first seven days. She could engage in normal everyday life, including sexual intercourse, without fear of contaminating anyone else (Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 73-74; cf. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 749-750). Thus, in a sense, the thirty-three days were a time of blood "purity" as compared to the previous seven days, but they were also a time of blood "purification" (or "purifying") as compared to the time after the thirty-three days, when the blood atonement had been made and she was pronounced "clean" by the priest (see vv. 6-8 below). In other words, the thirty-three day period was a time of "blood" (flow), but this was "pure blood," as opposed to the blood of the first seven days.<br>

 <a name="fn434" href="lev.htm#fnB434"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:5)  For clarification of the translation here, see the notes on vv. 2-4 above. <br>
 <b>sn</b> (12:5)  The doubling of the time after the birth of a female child is puzzling (see the remarks in Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 750-751 and Wenham, <i>Leviticus</i> NICOT, 188). Some have argued, for example, that it derives from the relative status of the sexes, or a supposed longer blood flow for the birth of a woman, or even to compensate for the future menstrual periods of the female just born. Perhaps there is a better explanation. First, a male child <i>must</i> be circumcised on the eighth day, so the impurity of the mother could not last beyond the first seven days lest it interfere with the circumcision rite. A female child, of course, was not circumcised, so the impurity of the mother could not interfere and the length of the impure time could be extended further. Second, it would be natural to expect that the increased severity of the blood flow after childbirth, as compared to that of a woman's menstrual period, would call for a longer period of impurity than the normal seven days of the menstrual period impurity (compare Lev 15:19 with 15:25-30). Third, this suggests that the fourteen day impurity period for the female child would have been more appropriate, and the impurity period for the birth of a male child had to be shortened. Fourth, not only the principle of multiples of seven but also multiples of forty applies to this reckoning. Since the woman's blood discharge after bearing a child continues for more than seven days, her discharge keeps her from contact with sacred things for a longer period of time in order to avoid contaminating the tabernacle (note Lev 15:31). This ended up totaling forty days for the birth of a male child (seven plus thirty-three) and a corresponding doubling of the second set of days for the woman (fourteen plus sixty-six). See <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:368-70. The fact that the offerings were the same for either a male or a female infant (vv. 6-8) suggests that the other differences in the regulations are not due to the notion that a male child had greater intrinsic value than a female child (Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 169). <br>

The purpose of sin offering "atonement," in particular, was to purge impurities from the tabernacle (see Lev 15:31 and 16:5-19, 29-34), whether they were caused by physical uncleannesses or sins and iniquities. In this case, the woman has not "sinned" morally by having a child. Even Mary brought such offerings for bearing Jesus (Luke 2:22-24). She certainly did not "sin" in giving birth to our savior. Note that the result of bringing this "sin offering" was "she will be clean," not "she will be forgiven" (cf. Lev 4:20, 26, 31, 35; 5:10, 13). The impurity of the blood flow has caused the need for this "sin offering," not some moral or relational infringement of the law (contrast Lev 4:2, "When a person sins by straying from any of the commandments of the LORD"). <br>

 <a name="fn447" href="lev.htm#fnB447"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:2)  It is sometimes difficult to know how to render some of the terms for disease or symptoms of disease in this chapter. Most modern English versions render the Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta@c= </FONT>"swelling" (from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">acn</FONT> "to lift up"), which has been retained here (see the explanation in Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 189). Some have argued that "<i>deeper</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qm)u*</FONT>) than the skin of his body" in v. 3 means that "this sore was lower than the surrounding skin" (Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 773), in which case "swelling" would be an inappropriate translation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta@c= </FONT>in v. 2. Similarly, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta@c= </FONT>also occurs in v. 19, and then v. 20 raises the issue of whether or not it appears to be "lower (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lp*v*</FONT>) than the skin" (cf. also 14:37 for a mark on the wall of a house), which may mean that the sore sinks below the surface of the skin rather than protruding above it as a swelling (Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 76-77). Thus, one could translate here, for example, "discoloration" (Milgrom and II <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta@c= </FONT>"spot, blemish on the skin" in <i>HALOT</i> 1301 [b]) or "local inflammation, boil, mole" (Levine). However, one could interpret "lower" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lp*v*</FONT>) as "deeper" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qm)u*</FONT>; i.e., visibly extending below the surface of the skin into the deeper layers as suggested by Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 188, 192). "Swelling" often extends deeply below the surface of the skin, it is certainly a common symptom of skin diseases, and the alternation of these two terms (i.e., "deeper" and "lower") in vv. 25-26 below shows that they both refer to the same phenomenon (see also the note on v. 20 below).<br>

 <b>sn </b> (13:2) Although the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tu^r&#180;x* </FONT>rendered here "diseased" is translated in many English versions as "leprosy," it does not refer to Hanson's disease, which is the modern technical understanding of the term "leprosy" (<i>HALOT</i> 1057 [a]). There has been much discussion of the proper meaning of the term and the disease(s) to which it may refer (see, e.g., Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 774-776, 816-826; Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 187-189 and the literature cited by them). The further description of the actual condition in the text suggests that the regulations are concerned with any kind of infectious diseases that are observable on the surface of the skin and, in addition to that, penetrate below the surface of the skin (vv. 3-4) or spread further across the surface of the skin (vv. 5-8). It is true that, in the OT, the term "disease" is often associated specifically with white "scaly" skin diseases that resemble the wasting away of the skin after death (see Milgrom who, in fact, translates "scale disease"; cf., e.g., Exod 4:6-7 and Num 12:9-12, esp. v. 12), but here it appears to be a broader term for any skin disease that penetrates deep or spreads far on the body. Scaly skin diseases would be included in this category, but also other types. Thus, a "swelling," "scab," or "bright spot" on the skin might be a symptom of disease, but not necessarily so. In this sense, "diseased" is a technical term. The term "infection" can apply to any "mark" on the skin whether it belongs to the category of "disease" or not (compare and contrast v. 3, where the "infection" is not "diseased," with v. 4, where the "infection" is found to be "diseased"). <br>
 <a name="fn452" href="lev.htm#fnB452"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:2)  The alternative rendering, "it shall be reported to Aaron the priest..." may be better in light of the parallel use of the same expression in Lev 14:2, where the priest had to go outside the camp in order to inspect the person who had been diseased. Since the rendering "he shall be brought to Aaron the priest..." might confuse matter there, this expression should be rendered "it shall be reported..." both here in 13:2 (cf. also v. 9) and in 14:2. See, however, the further note on 14:2 below, where it is argued that the diseased person would still need to "be brought" to the priest even if this happened outside the camp. <br>

The Hebrew verb "returns" is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv</FONT>, which often functions adverbially when combined with a second verb as it is here (cf.

Another suggestion is that here <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv</FONT> means "to recede" (cf., e.g., 2 Kings 20:9), so one could translate "the raw flesh recedes and turns white."

The Samaritan Pentateuch has only "in it," not "in its skin," and a few medieval Hebrew MSS as well as the LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate have only "in its skin" (cf. v. 24 below), not "in it." It does not effect the meaning of the verse, but one is tempted to suggested that "in it" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ob</FONT>) was added in error as a partial dittography from the beginning of "in its skin" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">oru)b=</FONT>). <br>

The alternation of these two terms (i.e., "deeper" and "lower") in vv. 25-26 below shows that they both refer to the same phenomenon.

 <a name="fn582" href="lev.htm#fnB582"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn </b> (14:2) The alternative rendering, "when it is reported to the priest" may be better in light of the fact that the priest had to go outside the camp. Since he or she had been declared "unclean" by a priest (Lev 13:3) and was, therefore, required to remain outside the camp (13:46), the formerly diseased person could not reenter the camp until he or she had been declared "clean" by a priest (cf. Lev 13:6 for "declaring clean."). See esp. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 831, who supports this rendering both here and in Lev 13:2 and 9. Levine, however, prefers our rendering (Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 76 and 85). It is the most natural meaning of the verb (i.e., "to be brought" from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aoB </FONT>"to come" in the Hophal stem, which means "to be brought" in all other occurrences in Leviticus other than 13:2, 9, and 14:2; see only 6:30; 10:18; 11:32; and 16:27), it suits the context well in 13:2, and the rendering "to be brought" is supported by 13:7b, "he shall show himself to the priest a second time." Although it is true that the priest needed to go outside the camp to examine such a person, the person still needed to "be brought" to the priest there. The translation of vv. 2-3 here suggests that v. 2 introduces the proceeding and then v. 3 proceeds to <br>

 <a name="fn585" href="lev.htm#fnB585"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:4)  The term rendered here "crimson fabric" consists of two Hebrew words and means literally, "crimson of worm" (in this order only in Lev 14:4, 6, 49, 51, 52 and Num 19:6; for the more common reverse order, "worm of crimson," see, e.g., the colored fabrics used in making the tabernacle, Exod 25:4, etc.). This particular "worm" is an insect that lives on the leaves of palm trees, the eggs of which are the source for a "crimson" dye used to color various kinds of clothe (Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 86). That a kind of dyed "fabric" is intended, not just the dye substance itself, is made certain by the dipping of it with the other ritual materials listed here into the blood and water mixture for sprinkling on the person being cleansed (Lev 14:6; cf. also the burning of it in the fire of the red heifer in Num 19:6). Both the reddish color of cedar wood and the crimson colored fabric seem to correspond to the color of blood and may, therefore, symbolize either "life," which is in the blood, or the use of blood to "make atonement" (see, e.g., Gen 9:4 and Lev 17:11). See further the note on v. 7 below. <br>
 <a name="fn586" href="lev.htm#fnB586"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (14:4)  <i>Twigs of hyssop</i> (probably one or several species of <i>marjoram thymus</i>), a spice and herb plant that grows out of walls in Palestine (see 1 Kgs 4:33 [5:13 HT], <i>HALOT</i> 27, and Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 195), were particularly leafy and therefore especially useful for sprinkling the purifying liquid (cf. vv. 5-7). Many of the details of the ritual procedure are obscure. It has been proposed, for example, that the "cedar wood" was a stick to which the hyssop was bound with the crimson material to make a sort of sprinkling instrument (Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 195). In light of the burning of these three materials as part of the preparation of the ashes of the red heifer in Num. 19:5-6, however, this seems unlikely.<br>
 <a name="fn587" href="lev.htm#fnB587"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:4)  The MT reads literally, "And the priest shall command and he shall take." Clearly, the second verb ("and he shall take") contains the thrust of the priest's command, which suggests the translation "that he take" (cf. also v. 5a). Since the priest issues the command here, he cannot be the subject of the second verb because he cannot be commanding himself to "take" up these ritual materials. Moreover, since the ritual is being performed "for the one being cleansed," the antecedent of the pronoun "he" cannot refer to him. The LXX, Samaritan Pentateuch, and Syriac versions have the third person plural here and in v. 5a, which corresponds to other combinations with the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hW&#180;x!w+ </FONT>"and he (the priest) shall command" in this context (see Lev 13:54; 14:36, 40). This suggests an impersonal (i.e., "someone shall take" and "someone shall slaughter," respectively) or perhaps even passive rendering of the verbs in 14:4, 5 (i.e., "there shall be taken" and "there shall be slaughtered," respectively). The latter option has been chosen here. <br>

Lev 14:50; 15:13; Num 19:17) refers to water that flows. It includes such water sources as artesian wells (Gen 26:19; Song of Songs 4:15), springs (Jer 2:13, as opposed to cisterns; cf. 17:13), and flowing streams (Zech 14:8). In other words, this is water that has not stood stagnant as, for example, in a sealed off cistern. <br>
 <b>sn</b> (14:5)  Although there are those who argue that the water and the blood rites are separate (e.g., Gerstenberger, <i>Leviticus</i>, OTL, 175-176), it is usually agreed that v. 5b refers to the slaughtering of the bird in such a way that its blood runs into the bowl, which contained fresh water (see, e.g., Snaith, <i>Leviticus and Numbers</i>, NCB, 74; Wenham, <i>Leviticus</i>, NICOT, 208; Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 836-838; cf. esp. Lev 14:51b, "and dip them in the blood of the slaughtered bird <i>and in</i> the fresh water"). This mixture of blood and water was then to be sprinkled on the person being cleansed from the disease.<br>
 <a name="fn591" href="lev.htm#fnB591"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tc</b> (14:6)  <i>Heb</i> "the live bird he [i.e., the priest] shall take it." Although the MT has no <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">w+</FONT> (<i>vav</i>, "and") at the beginning of this clause, a few medieval Hebrew MSS and the Samaritan Pentateuch have one and the LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate translate as if it is there. The "but" in the present translation reflects this text critical background, the object first clause word order with the resumptive pronoun at the end, and the obvious contrast between the slaughtered bird in v. 5 and the live bird in v. 6.<br>

 <a name="fn594" href="lev.htm#fnB594"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn </b> (14:7) The reddish color of cedar wood and the crimson colored fabric called for in v. 4 (see the note there, esp. the association with the color of blood) as well as the priestly commands to bring "two live" birds (v. 4a), to slaughter one of them "over fresh water" (literally "<i>living </i>water," v. 5b), and the subsequent ritual with the (second) "live" bird (vv. 6-7) combine to communicate the concept of "life" and "being alive" in this passage. This contrasts with the fear of death associated with the serious skin diseases in view here (see, e.g., Aaron's description of Miriam skin disease in Num 12:12, "Do not let her be like the dead one when it goes out from its mother's womb and its flesh half eaten away"). Since the slaughtered bird here is not sacrificed at the altar and is not designated as an expiatory "sin offering," this ritual procedure probably symbolizes the renewed life of the diseased person and displays it publicly for all to see. It is preparatory to the expiatory rituals that will follow (vv. 10-20, esp. vv. 18-20), but is not itself expiatory. Thus, although there are important similarities between the bird ritual here, the scapegoat on the Day of Atonement (Lev 16:20-22), and the red heifer for cleansing from corpse contamination (Num 19), this bird ritual is different in that the latter two constitute "sin offerings" (Lev 16:5, 8-10; Num 19:9, 17). Neither of the birds in Lev 14:4-7 is designated or treated as a "sin offering." Nevertheless, the very nature of the live bird ritual itself and its obvious similarity to the scapegoat ritual suggests that the patient's disease has been removed far away so that he or she is free from its effects both personally and communally. <br>

The end result of the ritual procedures in vv. 4-7 and the washing and shaving in v. 8a is that the formerly diseased person has now officially become clean in the sense that he can enter the community (see v. 8b; contrast living outside the community as an unclean diseased person, Lev 13:46). There are, however, further cleansing rituals and pronouncements for him to undergo in the tabernacle as outlined in vv. 10-20 (see Qal "be[come] clean" in vv. 9 and 20, Piel "pronounce clean" in v. 11, and Hitpael "the one being cleansed" in vv. 11, 14, 17, 18, and 19). Obviously, in order to enter the tabernacle he must already "be clean" in the sense of having access to the community.<br>

 <a name="fn600" href="lev.htm#fnB600"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:10)  This term is often rendered "fine flour," but it refers specifically to wheat as opposed to barley (Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 10) and, although the translation "flour" is used here, it may indicate "grits" rather than finely ground flour (Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 179; see the note on Lev 2:1). The unit of measure is most certainly an "ephah" even though it is not stated explicitly (see, e.g., Num 28:5; cf. 15:4, 6, 8), and three-tenths of an ephah would amount to about a gallon, or perhaps one-third of a bushel (Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 196; Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 845). Since the normal amount of flour for a lamb is one-tenth of an ephah (Num 28:4-5; cf. 15:4), three-tenths is about right for the three lambs offered in Lev 14:10-20. <br>
 <a name="fn601" href="lev.htm#fnB601"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:10)  A "log" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gO</FONT>) of oil is about one-sixth of a liter, or one-third of a pint, or two-thirds of a cup. <br>

Alternatively, the Piel of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rhf</FONT> could be rendered "who performs the cleansing/purification" (Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 827), perhaps even as a technical term for one who holds the office of "purification priest" (Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 87). It is probably better, however, to retain the same meaning here as in v. 7 above (see the note there regarding the declarative Piel use of this verb). <br>

 <a name="fn604" href="lev.htm#fnB604"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:12)  See the note on Lev 5:15 above. The primary purpose of the "guilt offering" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v*a*</FONT>) was to "atone" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rP#K! </FONT>"to make atonement," see v. 18 below and the note on Lev 1:4) for "trespassing" on the LORD's "holy things," whether sacred objects or sacred people. It is, therefore, closely associated with the reconsecration of the LORD's holy people as, for example, here and in the case of the corpse contaminated Nazirite (Num 6:11b-12). Since the nation of Israel was "a kingdom of priests and a <i>holy</i> nation" to the LORD (Exod 19:6; cf. the blood splashed on all the people in Exod 24:8), the skin diseased person was essentially a member of the "holy nation" who had been expelled from the community. Therefore, he or she had been desecrated and the guilt offering was essential to restoring him or her to the community. In fact, the manipulation of blood and oil in the guilt offering ritual procedure for the healed person (see vv. 14-18 below) is reminiscent of that employed for the ordination offering in the consecration of the holy Aaronic priests of the nation (Exod 29:19-21; Lev 8:22-30). <br>

Other possible translations include "elevate them [as] an elevation offering before the LORD," or "present them [as] a presentation offering before the LORD." To be sure, the actual physical "waving" of a male lamb seems unlikely, but some waving gesture may have been performed in the presentation of the offering (cf. also the "waving" of the Levites as a "wave offering" in Num 8:11, etc.). <br>

The Samaritan Pentateuch and LXX make the second verb "to slaughter" plural rather than singular, which suggests that it is to be taken as an impersonal passive (see Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 852). <br>

 <a name="fn685" href="lev.htm#fnB685"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:2)  <i>Heb</i> "man, man when there is a discharge from his flesh." The repetition of the word "man" is distributive, meaning "any [or, `every'] man" (GKC &#167;123.<i>c</i>). It is well-recognized that the term "flesh" (i.e., "body") in this chapter refers regularly and euphemistically to the male and female genital members or areas of the body (<i>HALOT</i> 164 [a]; see also, e.g., Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 93).

 <a name="fn687" href="lev.htm#fnB687"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tc</b> (15:3)  The Samaritan Pentateuch, LXX, and "Paleo-Hebrew Leviticus Scroll" (11QpaleoLev; Fragment G contains Lev 14:52-15:5 and 16:2-4, and agrees with the LXX of Lev 15:3b) texts are in essential (although not complete) agreement against the MT in Lev 15:3b and are to be preferred in this case. The shorter MT text has probably arisen due to a lengthy haplography. See K. A. Mathews, "The Leviticus Scroll (11QpaleoLev) and the Text of the Hebrew Bible," <i>CBQ</i> 48 (1986): 177-178, 198; D. N. Freedman, "Variant Readings in the Leviticus Scroll from Qumran Cave 11," <i>CBQ</i> 36 (1974): 528-529; D. N. Freedman and K. A. Mathews, <i>The Paleo-Hebrew Leviticus Scroll (11QpaleoLev)</i> (American Schools of Oriental Research, 1985), 32. The MT of Lev 15:3 reads: "Now this is his uncleanness in [regard to] his discharge--whether his body secretes his discharge or blocks his discharge, this is his uncleanness." The Samaritan Pentateuch adds after MT's "blocks his discharge" the following: "he is unclean; all the days that his body has a discharge or his body blocks his discharge, this is his uncleanness." Thus, the MT appears to skip from the Samaritan Pentateuch <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">awh amf </FONT>"he is unclean" in the middle of the verse to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ay</FONT>/<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wh wtamf</FONT> "this is his uncleanness" at the end of the verse, leaving out "he is unclean; all the days that his body has a discharge or his body blocks his discharge" (cf. the <i>BHS</i> footnote). 11QpaleoLev Fragment G is indeed fragmentary, but it does have<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> z ymy</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lk wb</FONT> "...in him, all the days of the fl[ow]," supporting the Samaritan Pentateuch and LXX tradition. The LXX adds after MT "blocks his discharge" the following: "all the days of the flow of his body, by which his body is affected by the flow," followed by "it is his uncleanness" (i.e., the last two words of the MT).<b> </b><br>
 <b>sn</b> (15:3)  The contrast between the dripping or flowing from the male sexual member as opposed to there being a blockage is important. One might not understand that even though a blockage actually causes a lack of discharge, it is still unclean.<br>
 <a name="fn688" href="lev.htm#fnB688"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:3)  <i>Heb</i> "it is his uncleanness," but the last clause recapitulates the effect of the first clause in this verse, both of which introduce the regulations for such uncleanness in the following verses.

The translation and meaning of this verse is a subject of much debate in the commentaries (see the summary in Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 938-940). It is difficult to determine what <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">awh</FONT> refers to, whether it means "he" referring to the one who does the touching, "it" for the furniture or the seat in v. 22, "she" referring to the woman herself (see the Samaritan Pentateuch <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ayh </FONT>rather than <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">awh</FONT>), or perhaps anything that was lying on the furniture or the bed of vv. 21-22.

The rendering here relies on the use of this expression for the very "presence" of God in Exod 33:14-15 and in the Lev 9:24-10:2 passage, where the Nadab and Abihu catastrophe referred to here is narrated.<br>
 <a name="fn729" href="lev.htm#fnB729"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:2)  <i>Heb</i> "into the holy place from house to the veil-canopy." In this instance, the Hebrew term "the holy place" refers to "the most holy place" (lit. "holy of holies"), since it is the area "inside the veil-canopy" (cf. Exod 26:33-34). The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tk#r)P* </FONT>is usually translated "veil" or "curtain," but it seems to have stretched not only in front of but also over the top of the ark of the covenant which stood behind and under it inside the most holy place (see <i>NIDOTTE</i> 3:687-89). <br>
 <a name="fn730" href="lev.htm#fnB730"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:2)  <i>Heb</i> "to the faces of the atonement plate." The exact meaning of the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tr\P)K^ </FONT>here rendered "atonement plate" is much debated. The traditional "<i>mercy</i> seat" does not suit the cognate relationship between this term and the Piel verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rP#K! </FONT>"to make atonement; to make expiation." The translation of the word should also reflect the fact that the most important atonement procedures on the Day of Atonement were performed in relation to it. Since the LORD would "appear in the cloud over the atonement plate," and since it was so closely associated with the ark of the covenant (the ark being his "footstool"; cf. 1 Chr 28:2 and Psa 137:7-8), one could take it to be the place of his throne at which he accepts atonement. See Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 1014; Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 234-235; and <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:691, 699. <br>

See the note on Lev 8:8 for the priestly casting of lots in Israel and the explanation in Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 102 on Lev 16:8-9. Milgrom suggests, however, that the expression here signifies that, the lots having been cast, the priest was to literally "place" (<i>Heb </i>"give") the one marked "for the LORD" on the head of the goat to be sacrificed and the one marked "for Azazel" on the head of the one to be released in the wilderness in order to avoid confusing them later in the ritual sequence (Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 1019-1020). <br>
 <a name="fn743" href="lev.htm#fnB743"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:8)  The meaning of the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lz}az&#180;u&amp; </FONT>(four times in the OT, all of them in this chapter; vv. 8, 10 [2 times], and 26) is much debated. There are three or perhaps four major views (see the summaries and literature cited in Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 1020-1021; Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 102; Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 237-238; David P. Wright, <i>The Disposal of Impurity</i>, 21-25; <i>NIDOTTE</i> 3:362-63 and 4:421-22). (1) Some derive the term from a combination of the Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">zu@ </FONT>"goat" (i.e., the word for "goats" in v. 5) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lz~a* </FONT>"to go away," meaning "the goat that departs" or "scapegoat" (cf., e.g., the LXX). This meaning suits the ritual practice of sending the so-called scapegoat away into the wilderness (vv. 10, 21-22, 26). Similarly, some derive the term from Arabic <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u~z~l~</FONT> "to banish, remove," meaning "entire removal" as an abstract concept (see already BDB 736b). (2) Some see the term as a description of the wilderness area to which the goat was dispatched, deriving it somehow from Arabic <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u~z&#180;z% </FONT>"rough ground" or perhaps <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">zzu</FONT> "to be strong, fierce." (3) The most common view among scholars today is that it is the proper name of a particular demon (perhaps even the devil himself) associated with the wilderness desert regions. Levine has proposed that it may perhaps derive from a reduplication of the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">z</FONT> in <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">zu@ </FONT>"goat" (see above) combined with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la@ </FONT>"mighty," meaning "mighty goat." The final consonantal form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lz}az&#180;u&amp; </FONT>would have resulted from the inversion of the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">a</FONT> with the second <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">z</FONT>. He makes the point that the close association between <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">zu@ </FONT>"goat" and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yr]yu!c=</FONT>, which seems to refer to "goat-demons" of the desert in Lev 17:7 (cf. Isa 13:21, etc.), should not be ignored in the derivation of Azazel, although the term ultimately became the name of "the demonic ruler of the wilderness." The latter view is support by the parallel between the one goat "for (<i>lamed</i><FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> </FONT>preposition) the LORD" and the one "for (<i>lamed </i>preposition) Azazel" here in v. 8. The rendering as a proper name has been tentatively accepted here. Perhaps a play on words between the proper name and the term for "goat" has occurred so that the etymology has become obscure. Even if a demon or the demonic realm is the source for the name, however, there is no intention here of appeasing the demons. The goal is to remove the impurity and iniquity from the community in order to avoid offending the LORD and the repercussions of such (see esp. vv. 21-22 and cf. Lev 15:31). <br>
 <a name="fn744" href="lev.htm#fnB744"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:9)  <i>Heb</i> "which the lot has gone up on it for the LORD." <br>

Lev 16:2). The term "testimony" in this expression refers to the ark as the container of the two stone tablets with the ten commandments written on them (see Exod 25:16 with Deut 10:1, 5, etc.). <br>
 <a name="fn751" href="lev.htm#fnB751"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:13)  <i>Heb</i> "and he will not die," but it is clear that the purpose for the incense cloud was to protect the priest from death in the presence of the LORD (cf. vv. 1-2 above). <br>
 <a name="fn752" href="lev.htm#fnB752"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:14)  <i>Heb</i> "on the faces of the atonement plate toward the east." Some have taken this to mean that the ark was stationed just behind the veil-canopy on the eastern side of the most holy place. Thus, the high priest would need to enter and walk toward the west end of the most holy place and then turn eastward in order to face the ark and sprinkle the blood in an eastward direction. The rendering here, however, requires that the ark was stationed on the western end, or perhaps in the middle of the area, so that as the priest entered he was already facing the ark and would sprinkle the blood on the eastern face of the atonement plate, in a westward direction (see, e.g., Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 239 versus Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 1032).<br>

In this case, the holy place etc. are direct objects of the verb "to atone" (cf. v. 33a below). In this case, therefore, the basic meaning of the verb (i.e., "to purge" or "wipe clean") comes to the forefront. When the prepositions <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu^ </FONT>or <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">du^B&amp; </FONT>occur with the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rP#K! </FONT>the purging is almost always being done "for" or "on behalf of" priests or people (see the note on Lev 1:4 as well as <i>NIDOTTE </i>2:698, the literature cited there, and Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 110 for more details). <br>

Verse 34 begins with the same clause except for the missing demonstrative pronoun "this" here in v. 29. The LXX has "this" in both places and it suits the sense of the passage, although both the verb and the pronoun are sometimes missing in this clause elsewhere in the book (see, e.g., Lev 3:17).<br>
 <a name="fn775" href="lev.htm#fnB775"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:29)  <i>Heb</i> "you shall humble your souls." The verb "to humble" here refers to various forms of self-denial, including but not limited to fasting (cf. Psa 35:13 and Isa 58:3, 10). The Mishnah (<i>m. Yoma</i> 8:1) lists abstentions from food and drink, bathing, using oil as an unguent to moisten the skin, wearing leather sandals, and sexual intercourse (cf. 2 Sam 12:16-17, 20; see the remarks in Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 1054; Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 109; and Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 242).<br>

 <a name="fn778" href="lev.htm#fnB778"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:30)  The phrase "from all your sins" could go with the previous clause as the verse is rendered here (see, e.g., Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 109 and Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 1011), or it could go with the following clause (i.e., "you shall be clean from all your sins before the LORD"; see the MT accents as well as Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 221 and most of the recent English versions, e.g., NASB, NIV, NRSV, etc.). <br>

 <a name="fn783" href="lev.htm#fnB783"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:33)  <i>Heb</i> "and the tent of meeting and the alter he shall atone." The repetition of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rP#K! </FONT>("to atone") at the beginning and end of the sequence appears to be strange, but the MT accents suggest that only "the Most Holy Place" goes with the verb at the beginning of the verse. Of course, the purging of "the Most Holy Place" has been the main emphasis of this chapter from the start (see vv. 2-3 and 11-17). <br>
 <a name="fn784" href="lev.htm#fnB784"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:33)  At this point in the verse the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rP#K! </FONT>"to make atonement" takes its object with the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu^ </FONT>"for" (literally, "upon"; contrast the first part of the verse and cf. the notes on Lev 1:4 and 16:20 above). <br>

 <a name="fn787" href="lev.htm#fnB787"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:34)  The MT of Lev 16:34b reads literally, "and he did just as the LORD had commanded Moses." This has been retained here in spite of the fact that it suggests that Aaron immediately performed the rituals outlined in Lev 16 (see, e.g., Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 224 and 243; Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i> [AB], 1059; note that Aaron was the one to whom Moses was to speak the regulations in this chapter, v. 2). The problem is that the chapter presents these procedures as regulations for "the tenth day of the seventh month" and calls for their fulfillment at that time (Lev 16:29; cf. Lev 23:26-32 and the remarks in Budd, <i>Leviticus</i> [NCBC], 237), not during the current (first) month (Exod 40:2; note also that they left Sinai in the second month, long before the next seventh month, Num 10:11). The LXX translates, "once in the year it shall be done as the LORD commanded Moses," attaching "once in the year" to this clause rather than the former one, and rendering the verb as passive, "it shall be done" (cf. NIV, RSV, NRSV, etc.). We have already observed the passive use of active verbs in this context (see the note on v. 32 above). The RSV (cf. also the NRSV) translates, "And Moses did as the LORD commanded him," ignoring the fact that the name Moses in the Hebrew text has the direct object indicator. Passive verbs, however, regularly take subjects with direct object indicators (see, e.g., v. 27 above). The NIV renders it "And it was done, as the LORD commanded Moses," following the LXX passive translation. The NASB translates, "And just as the LORD had commanded Moses, <i>so</i> he did," transposing the introductory verb to the end of the sentence and supplying "so" in order to make it fit the context.<br>
 <a name="fn788" href="lev.htm#fnB788"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:3)  The Hebrew text has here simply "blood," but in this case it refers to the illegitimate shedding of animal blood, similar to the shedding of the blood of an innocent human being (Deut 19:10, etc.). In order for it to be legitimate the animal must be slaughtered at the tabernacle and its blood handled by the priests in the prescribed way (see, e.g., Lev 1:5; 3:2, 17; 4:5-7; 7:26-27, etc.; cf. vv. 10-16 below for more details).<br>

The uses of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp#n\ </FONT>in this and the following verse are most significant for the use of animal blood in Israel's sacrificial system. Unfortunately, it is a most difficult word to translate accurately and consistently, and this presents a major problem for the rendering of these verses (see, e.g., Wenham, <i>Leviticus</i>, NICOT, 244-245). No matter which translation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp#n\ </FONT>one uses here, it is important to see that both man and animal have <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp#n\ </FONT>and that this <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp#n\ </FONT>is identified with the blood. See the further remarks on v. 11 below. On the "cutting off" penalty see the note on v. 4 above. In this instance, God takes it on himself to "cut off" the person (i.e., extirpation). <br>
 <a name="fn813" href="lev.htm#fnB813"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:11)  <i>Heb</i> "for the soul/life (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp#n\</FONT>) of the flesh, it is in the blood" (cf. the note of v. 10 above and v. 14 below). Although most modern translations begin a new sentence in v. 11, "For the life of the flesh is in the blood,..." (see, e.g., NJPS, NASB, NIV, NRSV, etc.), the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> ("for; because") at the beginning of the verse suggests continuation from v. 10, as the rendering here indicates (see, e.g., the NEB, Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 261, and Wenham, <i>Leviticus</i>, NICOT, 239).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (17:11)  This verse is a well-known <i>crux interpretum</i> for blood atonement in the Bible. The close association between the blood and "the soul/life [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp#n\</FONT>] of the flesh [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rc*B*</FONT>]" (v. 11a) begins in Gen 9:2-5 (if not Gen 4:10-11), where the LORD grants man the eating of meat (i.e., the "flesh" of animals) but also issues a warning: "But flesh [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rc*B*</FONT>] with its soul/life [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp#n\</FONT>], [which is] its blood, you shall not eat" (cf. Wenham, <i>Genesis 1-15</i> [WBC], 151 and 193). Unfortunately, the difficulty in translating <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp#n\ </FONT>consistently (see the note on v. 10 above) obscures the close connection between the (human) "person" in v. 10 and "the life" (of animals, 2 times) and "your (human) lives" in v. 11, all of which are renderings of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp#n\ </FONT>in Hebrew. The basic logic of the passage is that (a) no <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp#n\ </FONT>should eat the blood when he eats the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rc*B* </FONT>of an animal (v. 10) because (b) the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp#n\ </FONT>of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rc*B* </FONT>is identified with the blood that flows through and permeates it (v. 11a), and (c) the LORD himself has assigned (i.e., limited the use of) animal blood, that is, animal <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp#n\</FONT>, to be the instrument or price of making atonement for the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp#n\ </FONT>of people (v. 11b). See the detailed remarks and literature cited in <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:693-95, 697-98.<br>

The interpretation of the preposition is pivotal here. Some scholars have argued that it is a <i>bet</i> of exchange; that is, "the blood makes atonement in exchange for the life [of the slaughtered animal]" (see <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:694-95, 697 for analysis and criticism of this view). It is more likely that, as in the previous clause ("your lives"), "life/soul" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp#n\</FONT>) here refers to the person who makes the offering, not the animal offered. The blood of the animal makes atonement for the person who offers it either "by means of" (instrumental <i>bet</i>) the "life/soul" of the animal, which it symbolizes or embodies (the meaning of the translation given here); or perhaps the blood of the animal functions as "the price" (<i>bet </i>of price) for ransoming the "life/soul" of the person.<br>

Note esp. the thematic and formulaic relationships between the introduction here in Lev 18:1-5 and the paranesis in Lev 20:22-26, both of which refer explicitly to the corrupt nations and the need to separate from them by keeping the LORD's regulations.<br>

The repetition of the word "man" is distributive, meaning "any [or, `every'] man" (GKC &#167;123.<i>c</i>; cf. Lev 15:2). The two words for "flesh" are combined to refer to emphasize the physical familial relatedness (see Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 282 and Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 119). <br>

This expression occurs a number of times in the following context and is generally translated "have sexual relations with [someone]," although in the case of the father mentioned in the following verse the expression may be connected to the shame or disgrace that would belong to the father whose wife's sexuality is violated by his son.

 <b>sn </b> (18:7) Commentators suggest that the point of referring to the father's nakedness is that the mother's sexuality belongs to the father and is forbidden to the son on that account (see Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 120 and Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 294). The expression may, however, derive from the shame of nakedness when exposed. If one exposes his mother's nakedness to himself it is like openly exposing the father's nakedness (cf. Gen 9:22-23 with the background of Gen 2:25 and 3:7, 21). The same essential construction is used in v. 10 where the latter explanation makes more sense than the former. <br>
 <a name="fn842" href="lev.htm#fnB842"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:8)  <i>Heb</i> "the nakedness of your father she is." See the note on v. 7 above. This law refers to another wife of the man's father, who is not that man's mother. The laws in the Pentateuch sometimes assume the possibility that a man may have more than one wife (cf., e.g., Deut 21:15-17). <br>
 <a name="fn843" href="lev.htm#fnB843"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn </b> (18:9) <i>Heb</i> "the daughter your father or the daughter of your mother." <br>

 <a name="fn845" href="lev.htm#fnB845"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tc</b> (18:9)  Several medieval Hebrew MSS, the Samaritan Pentateuch, LXX, and Syriac have "her nakedness" rather than "their nakedness," thus agreeing with singular "sister" at the beginning of the verse.<br>
 <a name="fn846" href="lev.htm#fnB846"><sup>16</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:10)  That is, to have sexual relations with one's granddaughter would be like openly exposing one's own shameful nakedness (see the note on v. 7 above).<br>

That is, a half sister, the daughter of the man's father by another wife, who is not the man's mother, is to be considered a true sister. Therefore, the man must not have sexual relations with her.<br>
 <a name="fn848" href="lev.htm#fnB848"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tc </b> (18:12) A few medieval Hebrew MSS, the LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate all read "because she is the flesh of your father," like the MT of v. 13. <br>

In this kind of context, "take" means to "take in marriage" (cf. also v. 18). The LXX and Syriac have "their nakedness," referring to the nakedness of the woman's granddaughters, rather than the nakedness of the woman herself. <br>

 <a name="fn854" href="lev.htm#fnB854"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:17)  The term rendered "lewdness" almost always carries a connotation of cunning, evil device, and divisiveness (cf. <i>HALOT</i> 272, "infamy"), and is closely associated with sexual and religious infidelity (cf., e.g., Lev 19:29; 20:14; Job 31:11; Jer 13:27; Ezek 16:27; 22:9, etc.).<br>

According to <i>HALOT</i> 1059 [b] (III <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rrx</FONT>), the infinitive "to be a second wife" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rr)x=l!</FONT>) is a denominative verb from II <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hr&#180;x* </FONT>A "concubine; second wife" which, in turn, derives from II <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rrx</FONT> "to treat with hostility" (cf.

 <a name="fn859" href="lev.htm#fnB859"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:21)  <i>Heb</i> "And from your seed you shall not give to cause to pass over to Molech." The Samaritan Pentateuch (cf. also the LXX) has "to cause to serve" rather than "to cause to pass over." For detailed remarks on Molech and Molech worship see Snaith, <i>Leviticus and Numbers</i>, NCB, 87-88; Budd, <i>Leviticus</i>, NCBC, 259-260; and Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 333-337 and the literature cited there. It could refer to either human sacrifice or a devotion of children to some sort of service of Molech, perhaps of a sexual sort (cf. Lev 20:2-5; 2 Kings 23:10, etc.). The inclusion of this prohibition against Molech worship here may be due to some sexual connection of this kind, or perhaps simply to the lexical link between <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ur~z\ </FONT>meaning "seed, semen" in v. 20 but "offspring" in v. 21.<br>

Lev 18:26-27, 29-30). It can also designate, as here, detestable acts that might be perpetrated by the native peoples (it is used again in reference to homosexuality in Lev 20:13; cf. also its use for unclean food, Deut 14:3; idol worship, Isa 41:24; remarriage of a former wife has been married in between, Deut 24:4; etc.).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (19:17)  The meaning of the line is somewhat obscure.

If there is a distinction, the construction here probably calls for direct and helpful action toward one's neighbor (see the discussion in Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 305 and esp. 317-18). Such love stands in contrast to taking vengeance or bearing a grudge against someone and, in NT terms, amounts to fulfilling the "golden rule" (Matt 7:12). <br>

The rendering here assumes that the point of this clause is simply that finally being allowed to eat the fruit in the fifth year adds the fruit of the tree to their harvest. Some take the verb to be from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[sa</FONT> ("to gather") rather than <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[sy</FONT> ("to add; to increase"), rendering the verse, "to gather to you the produce" (Gerstenberger, <i>Leviticus</i> [OTL], 260, and see the versions referred to in Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 306).

At first glance Lev 20:27 appears to be out of place but, on closer examination, one could argue that it constitutes the back side of an envelope around the case laws in 20:9-21, with Lev 20:6 forming the front of the envelope (note also that execution of mediums and spiritists by stoning in v. 27 is not explicitly stated in v. 6). This creates a chiastic structure: prohibition against mediums and spiritists (vv. 6 and 27), variations of the holiness formula (vv. 7 and 25-26), and exhortations to obey the LORD's statutes (and judgments; vv. 8 and 22-24).

The priests were responsible to see that the portions of the offerings that were to be consumed by the priests as prebends not become accessible to the people. Mistakes in this matter (cf. v. 14) would bring "guilt" on the people, requiring punishment (v. 16). <br>

 <a name="fn1061" href="lev.htm#fnB1061"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:21)  The meaning of the expression <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rd\n\-aL@p^l=</FONT> rendered here "for a special votive offering" is much debated. Some take it as an expression for fulfilling a vow, "to fulfill a vow" (e.g., <i>HALOT</i> 927-28 and NASB; cf. NRSV "in fulfillment of a vow") or, alternatively, "to make a vow" or "for making a vow" (<i>HALOT</i> 928). Perhaps it refers to the making a special vow, from the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">alp</FONT> ("to be wonderful; to be remarkable"); cf. Milgrom, <i>Numbers</i> [JPSTC], 44. Levine suggests that this is a special term for "setting aside a votive offering" (related to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlp</FONT> ["to set aside"]; Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 151 and 193). In general, the point of the expression seems to be that this sacrifice arises as a special gift to God out of special circumstances in the life of the worshiper.<br>

The Samaritan Pentateuch has plural <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;hb</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ytjvm</FONT> ("deformities in them"; cf. the LXX translation). The Qumran Leviticus scroll (11QpaleoLev) has <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">mh myt</FONT>[...], in which case the restored participle would appear to be the same as the Samaritan Pentateuch, but there is no <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">b</FONT> (<i>bet</i>) preposition before the pronoun, yielding "they are deformed" (see Freedman and Mathews, <i>The Paleo-Hebrew Leviticus Scroll</i>, ASOR, 1985, p. 41 and the remarks in Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 358).<br>

It is clear, however, that the two lambs and the loaves (along with their associated grain and drink offerings) constituted the "wave offering," which served as the prebend "for the priest."

However, in Lev 24:4 the adjective "pure" is feminine, corresponding to "lampstand," not an assumed noun "gold" (contrast Exod 25:31), and the "table" in v. 6 was overlaid with gold, but was not made of pure gold. Therefore, it is probably better to translate "[ceremonially] pure lampstand" (v. 4) and "[ceremonially] pure table" (v. 6); see NEB, Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 164-165, and Wenham, <i>Leviticus</i>, NICOT, 307.<br>

Perhaps the frankincense was placed "with" or "along side of" each row, not actually on the bread itself, and was actually burned as incense to the LORD (see, e.g., NIV, NRSV, Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 165).

 <a name="fn1163" href="lev.htm#fnB1163"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:11)  The verb rendered "misused" means literally "to bore through; to pierce" (<i>HALOT</i> 719; it is from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bqn</FONT>, not <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bbq</FONT>, see the participial form in v. 16a). Its exact meaning here is uncertain. The two verbs together may form a hendiadys, "he pronounced by cursing blasphemously" (Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 166), the idea being one of the following: (1) he pronounced the name "Yahweh" in a way or with words that amounted to "some sort of verbal aggression against Yahweh himself" (Gerstenberger, <i>Leviticus</i> [OTL], 362), (2) he pronounced a curse against the man using the name "Yahweh" (Snaith, <i>Leviticus and Numbers</i>, NCB, 110; Wenham, <i>Leviticus</i> [NICOT], 311), or (3) he pronounced the name "Yahweh" and thereby blasphemed, since the "Name" was never to be pronounced (a standard Jewish explanation). In one way or another, the offense surely violated Exod 20:7, one of the ten commandments, and the same verb for cursing is used explicitly in Exod 22:28 [27 HT] prohibition against "cursing" God. For a full discussion of these and related options for interpreting this verse see Budd, <i>Leviticus</i> [NCBC], 335-336; Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 408-409; and Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 166. <br>

There are five main views. (1) The first clause of the verse actually attaches to the previous verse, and refers to the fact that their houses retain a perpetual right of redemption (v. 32b), "which any of the Levites may exercise" (v. 33a; Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 418, 421). (2) It refers to property that one Levite sells to another Levite, which is then redeemed by still another Levite (v. 33a). In such cases, the property reverts to the original Levite owner in the jubilee year (v. 33b; Wenham, <i>Leviticus</i>, NICOT, 321). (3) It refers to houses in a city that had come to be declared as a levitical city but had original non-levitical owners. Once the city was declared to belong to the Levites, however, an owner could only sell his house to a Levite, and he could only redeem it back from a Levite up until the time of the first jubilee after the city was declared to be a levitical city. Thus, the first part of the verse translates, "Such property as may be redeemed from the Levites" (NRSV and NJPS). At the first jubilee, however, all such houses became the property of the Levites (v. 33b; Budd, <i>Leviticus</i>, NCBC, 353). (4) It refers to property "which is <i>appropriated</i> from the Levites" (not `<i>redeemed</i> from the Levites,' v. 33a) by those who have bought it or taken it as security for debts owed to them by Levites who had fallen on bad times. Again, such property reverts back to the original Levite owners at the jubilee (Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 177). (5) It simply refers to the fact that a Levite has the option of redeeming his house (i.e., the prefix form of the verb is taken to be subjunctive, "may or might redeem"), which he had to sell because he had fallen into debt or perhaps even become destitute. Even if he never gained the resources to do so, however, it would still revert to him in the jubilee year. The rendering offered in the main text above is intended to reflect this latter view. <br>

 <a name="fn1327" href="lev.htm#fnB1327"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:30)  The translation reflects the Hebrew wordplay "your corpses...the corpses of your idols."

 <a name="fn1331" href="lev.htm#fnB1331"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:34)  There are two Hebrew roots <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hxr</FONT>, one meaning "to be pleased with; to take pleasure" (<i>HALOT</i>  1280-81; cf.

 <a name="fn1335" href="lev.htm#fnB1335"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:37)  The term rendered "to stand up" is a noun, not an infinitive. It occurs only here and appears to designate someone who would take a powerful stand for them against their enemies. <br>

 <a name="fn1338" href="lev.htm#fnB1338"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:40)  <i>Heb</i> "And." Many English versions take this to be a conditional clause ("if...") though there is no conditional particle (see, e.g., NASB, NIV, NRSV; but see the very different rendering in Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 190). The temporal translation offered here ("when") takes into account the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">za*</FONT> ("then"), which occurs twice in v. 41. The obvious contextual contrast between vv. 39 and 40 is expressed by "however" in the translation.<br>
 <a name="fn1339" href="lev.htm#fnB1339"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:40)  <i>Heb</i> "in their trespassing which they trespassed in me." See the note on Lev 5:15, although the term is used in a more technical sense there in relation to the "guilt offering." <br>

 <a name="fn1345" href="lev.htm#fnB1345"><sup>67</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:43)  <i>Heb</i> "from them." The preposition "from" refers here to the agent of the action (Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 455). <br>
 <a name="fn1346" href="lev.htm#fnB1346"><sup>68</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:43)  The jussive form of the verb with the simple <i>vav</i> here calls for a translation that expresses purpose. <br>
 <a name="fn1347" href="lev.htm#fnB1347"><sup>69</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:43)  The verb is the Hophal infinitive construct with the third feminine singular suffix (GKC &#167;67.<i>y</i>; cf. v. 34).<br>

 <a name="fn1353" href="lev.htm#fnB1353"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (27:2)  Cf. the note on Lev 22:21. Some take this as an expression for fulfilling a vow, "to fulfill a vow" (e.g., <i>HALOT</i>  927-28 and NASB; cf. NRSV "in fulfillment of a vow") or, alternatively, "to make a vow" or "for making a vow" (<i>HALOT</i>  928). Perhaps it refers to the making a special vow, from the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">alp</FONT> ("to be wonderful; to be remarkable"), cf. Milgrom, <i>Numbers</i> [JPSTC], 44. Levine suggests that this is a special term for "setting aside a votive offering" (related to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlp</FONT> "to set aside"; Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 151 and 193). In general, the point of the expression seems to be that this sacrifice is a special gift to God that arose out of special circumstances in the life of the worshiper.<br>
 <a name="fn1354" href="lev.htm#fnB1354"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (27:2)  <i>Heb</i> "in your valuation, persons to the LORD," but "in your valuation" is a frozen form and, therefore, the person ("your") does not figure into the translation (see Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 73). Instead of offering a person to the LORD one could redeem that person with the appropriate amount of money delineated in the following verses (see the note on Lev 5:15 above and the explanation in Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 480-481).<br>

The plural active verb is sometimes best rendered in the passive (GKC &#167;144.<i>f</i>, <i>g</i>). Some medieval Hebrew MSS, the Samaritan Pentateuch, a MS of the Targum, and the Vulgate all have the singular verb instead (cf. similarly v. 11).<br>

The Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;r\j@ </FONT>is a much discussed term.

In this book it is commonly used when the LORD commands Moses "to speak [un]to" a person or group of persons (see, e.g., Lev 1:2; 4:2, etc.). The translation "to tell" here reflects this pattern in the book.
