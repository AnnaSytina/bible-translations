<a name="_Toc494012800"></a><p><i>Vision of the Glory of God</i>
<p><A NAME="1"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> In the thirtieth year,<a name="fnB0" href="eze_note.htm#fn0"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> on the fifth day of the fourth month, while I was among the exiles at the Kebar River,<a name="fnB1" href="eze_note.htm#fn1"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> the heavens opened<a name="fnB2" href="eze_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> and I saw visions<a name="fnB3" href="eze_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> of God. 
<bqverse 2>2  (In the fifth day of the month--the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's exile-- 
<bqverse 3>3 the word of the LORD came to the priest Ezekiel<a name="fnB4" href="eze_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> the son of Buzi,<a name="fnB5" href="eze_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> at the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians.<a name="fnB6" href="eze_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> The hand<a name="fnB7" href="eze_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> of the LORD came on him there). <p>

<bqverse 4>4 As I watched, I saw a windstorm<a name="fnB8" href="eze_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> coming from the north--an enormous cloud surrounded by a radiance<a name="fnB9" href="eze_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and a fire flashing forth,<a name="fnB10" href="eze_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> and in the fire something like a glowing substance.<a name="fnB11" href="eze_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  In the fire were what looked like<a name="fnB12" href="eze_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> four living beings.<a name="fnB13" href="eze_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> As for their appearance,<a name="fnB14" href="eze_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> they had human form.<a name="fnB15" href="eze_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6 Each had four faces and four wings, 
<bqverse 7>7 their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like calves' feet. They gleamed<a name="fnB16" href="eze_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> like burnished bronze. 
<bqverse 8>8  They had human hands<a name="fnB17" href="eze_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> under their wings on their four sides. Each of the four had faces and wings; 
<bqverse 9>9 their wings touched each other. They did not turn as they moved, but went straight ahead. <p>

<bqverse 10>10 Their faces had this appearance: each of the four had the face of a man, with the face of a lion on the right, the face of an ox on the left and also the face of an eagle-- 
<bqverse 11>11 thus were their faces.<a name="fnB18" href="eze_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> Their wings were spread out above; each had two wings touching the wings of one of the other beings on either side and two wings covering their bodies. 
<bqverse 12>12 Each moved straight ahead--wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went. 
<bqverse 13>13 <a name="fnB19" href="eze_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> The appearance of the living beings was like burning coals of fire,<a name="fnB20" href="eze_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> like torches. The fire moved back and forth among the living beings. It was bright, and lightning was flashing out of the fire. 
<bqverse 14>14 The living beings ran backward and forward like flashes of lightning<a name="fnB21" href="eze_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a>. <p>

<bqverse 15>15 As I looked at the living beings, I saw a wheel<a name="fnB22" href="eze_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> touching the earth<a name="fnB23" href="eze_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> beside each one of the four. 
<bqverse 16>16 The appearance of the wheels and their construction was like jasper,<a name="fnB24" href="eze_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> and all four wheels looked alike. Their structure was like a wheel within a wheel.<a name="fnB25" href="eze_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17 When they moved they would go in any of the four directions they faced; they did not turn as they moved. 
<bqverse 18>18 Their rims were high and awesome<a name="fnB26" href="eze_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> and the rims of all four wheels were full of eyes all around. <p>

<bqverse 19>19  When the living beings moved, the wheels beside them moved; when the living beings rose up from the ground, the wheels rose up too. 
<bqverse 20>20  Wherever the spirit would go, they would go,<a name="fnB27" href="eze_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> and the wheels would rise up beside them, because the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels. 
<bqverse 21>21  When the living beings moved, the wheels moved, and when they stopped moving, the wheels stopped. When they rose up from the ground, the wheels rose up from the ground; the wheels rose up beside them, because the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels. <p>

<bqverse 22>22 Over the heads of the living beings was something like an expanse,<a name="fnB28" href="eze_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> glittering awesomely like ice<a name="fnB29" href="eze_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> stretched out over their heads. 
<bqverse 23>23 Under the expanse their wings were stretched out, each toward the other. Each of the beings also had two wings giving cover--each had two covering the body. 
<bqverse 24>24 When they moved, I heard the sound<a name="fnB30" href="eze_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> of their wings--it was like the noise of mighty waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a sound of tumult<a name="fnB31" href="eze_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> like the sound of an army. When they stopped moving, they lowered their wings. <p>

<bqverse 25>25 Then there was a voice from above the expanse over their heads. When they stopped moving, they lowered their wings. 
<bqverse 26>26 Above the expanse over their heads was something like a throne made of sapphire. On the throne, high above, was a form that appeared to be a man. 
<bqverse 27>27  I saw a glowing substance<a name="fnB32" href="eze_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> that looked like fire enclosed all around from his waist up. From his waist down I saw something that looked like fire, and there was a brilliant light around it. 
<bqverse 28>28  The appearance of the brilliant light all around him was like a rainbow in the clouds after the rain.<a name="fnB33" href="eze_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of LORD. When I saw<a name="fnB34" href="eze_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> it, I threw myself down with my face to the ground, and I heard someone's voice speaking. 
<bqchapter 2>
<a name="_Toc494012801"></a></p>
<p><i>Commission of Ezekiel</i>
<p><A NAME="2"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> He said to me, "Son of man,<a name="fnB35" href="eze_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> stand on your feet and I will speak with you."<a name="fnB36" href="eze_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  As he spoke to me, the Spirit came into me and stood me on my feet, and I heard the one speaking to me. <p>

<bqverse 3>3 He said to me, "Son of man, I am sending you to the people of Israel, to a rebellious nation<a name="fnB37" href="eze_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> that has rebelled against me; both they and their fathers have transgressed<a name="fnB38" href="eze_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> against me to this very day. 
<bqverse 4>4 The people<a name="fnB39" href="eze_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> to whom I am sending you are obstinate and hard-hearted,<a name="fnB40" href="eze_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> and you must say to them, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says.'<a name="fnB41" href="eze_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  And as for them,<a name="fnB42" href="eze_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> whether they hear or not<a name="fnB43" href="eze_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a>--for they are a rebellious<a name="fnB44" href="eze_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> house<a name="fnB45" href="eze_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a>--they will know that a prophet has been among them. 
<bqverse 6>6  But you, son of man, do not fear them, and do not fear their words, even though briers<a name="fnB46" href="eze_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> and thorns<a name="fnB47" href="eze_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> surround you and you live among scorpions. Do not fear their words and do not be terrified of the looks they give you,<a name="fnB48" href="eze_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> for they are a rebellious house! 
<bqverse 7>7  You must speak my words to them whether they pay attention or not, for they are rebellious. 
<bqverse 8>8 As for you, son of man, hear what I say to you: Do not rebel like that rebellious house! Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you." <p>

<bqverse 9>9 Then I saw<a name="fnB49" href="eze_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> a hand stretched out to me, and in it was a written scroll. 
<bqverse 10>10 He unrolled it before me, and it had writing on the front<a name="fnB50" href="eze_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> and back;<a name="fnB51" href="eze_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> written on it were lamentation and mourning and woe. <p>

<bqchapter 3><A NAME="3"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> He said to me, "Son of man, eat what you see in front of you<a name="fnB52" href="eze_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a>--eat this scroll--and then go and speak to the house of Israel." 
<bqverse 2>2 So I opened my mouth and he fed me the scroll. <p>

<bqverse 3>3 He said to me, "Son of man, feed your stomach and fill your belly with this scroll I am giving to you." So I ate it,<a name="fnB53" href="eze_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> and it was sweet as honey<a name="fnB54" href="eze_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> in my mouth. <p>

<bqverse 4>4  He said to me, "Son of man, go now to the house of Israel and speak my words to them. 
<bqverse 5>5  For I am not sending you to a people of obscure speech<a name="fnB55" href="eze_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> and difficult language,<a name="fnB56" href="eze_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> but<a name="fnB57" href="eze_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> to the house of Israel-- 
<bqverse 6>6  not to many peoples of obscure speech and difficult language, whose words you cannot understand<a name="fnB58" href="eze_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a>--surely if<a name="fnB59" href="eze_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> I had sent you to them, they would listen to you! 
<bqverse 7>7  But the house of Israel will not listen to you,<a name="fnB60" href="eze_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> because they are not willing to listen to me,<a name="fnB61" href="eze_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> for the whole house of Israel is hard-headed and hard-hearted.<a name="fnB62" href="eze_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 8>8  "I have set your face hard<a name="fnB63" href="eze_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> against their faces, and your forehead hard against their foreheads. 
<bqverse 9>9 I have made your face harder than flint--like diamond!<a name="fnB64" href="eze_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> Do not fear them or be dismayed by their looks,<a name="fnB65" href="eze_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> for they are a rebellious house."<p>

<bqverse 10>10  And he said to me, "Son of man, listen carefully to all my words that I speak to you and take them to heart. 
<bqverse 11>11  Go to the exiles, to your fellow countrymen,<a name="fnB66" href="eze_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> and speak to them--say to them, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says,' whether they pay attention or not." <a name="_Toc494012802"></a></p>
<p><i>Ezekiel Before the Exiles</i>
<p>
<bqverse 12>12 Then the Spirit lifted me up<a name="fnB67" href="eze_note.htm#fn67"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> and I heard a great rumbling sound behind me--Blessed be the glory of the LORD<a name="fnB68" href="eze_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> in his place!<a name="fnB69" href="eze_note.htm#fn69"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a>-- 
<bqverse 13>13  the sound of the living beings' wings brushing against each other, and the sound of the wheels alongside them, a loud rumbling sound. 
<bqverse 14>14 The Spirit lifted me up and carried me away. I went bitterly, my spirit full of anger, and the hand of the LORD rested powerfully<a name="fnB70" href="eze_note.htm#fn70"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> on me. 
<bqverse 15>15  I came to the exiles at Tel Abib,<a name="fnB71" href="eze_note.htm#fn71"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> who lived by the Kebar River. And I sat among them there, where they were living, for seven days, dumbfounded.<a name="fnB72" href="eze_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 16>16  At the end of seven days the word of the LORD came to me:<a name="fnB73" href="eze_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  "Son of man, I have appointed you a watchman<a name="fnB74" href="eze_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> for the house of Israel, and whenever you hear a word from my mouth and you must give them a warning from me. 
<bqverse 18>18  If I say to the wicked, "You will certainly die," and you do not warn him--you do not speak out to warn him<a name="fnB75" href="eze_note.htm#fn75"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> to turn from his evil conduct so that he may live--that wicked person will die for<a name="fnB76" href="eze_note.htm#fn76"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> his iniquity, but I will hold you accountable for his death..<a name="fnB77" href="eze_note.htm#fn77"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  But if you warn the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his evil conduct, he will die for his iniquity but you will have saved your own life.<a name="fnB78" href="eze_note.htm#fn78"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 20>20 "When a righteous person turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I set a stumbling block<a name="fnB79" href="eze_note.htm#fn79"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> before him, he will die. Because you did not warn him, he will die for his sin. The righteous deeds he performed will not be remembered, but I will hold you accountable for his death. 
<bqverse 21>21  However, if you warn the righteous person not to sin, and he<a name="fnB80" href="eze_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> does not sin, he will certainly live because he was warned, and you will have saved your own life."<a name="_Toc494012803"></a></p>
<p><i>Isolation and Silenced</i>
<p>
<bqverse 22>22 The hand of the LORD rested on me there, and he said to me, "Get up, go out to the valley,<a name="fnB81" href="eze_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> and I will speak with you there." 
<bqverse 23>23  So I got up and went out to the valley, and the glory of the LORD was standing there, just like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River; and I threw myself down with my face to the ground. <p>

<bqverse 24>24 Then the Spirit came into me and stood me on my feet. He spoke with me and said, "Go shut yourself in your house. 
<bqverse 25>25 As for you, son of man, they will put ropes on you and tie you up with them, so you cannot go out among the people. 
<bqverse 26>26 I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be unable to speak;<a name="fnB82" href="eze_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> you will be unable to reprove<a name="fnB83" href="eze_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> them, for they are a rebellious house. 
<bqverse 27>27  But when I speak to you,<a name="fnB84" href="eze_note.htm#fn84"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> I will loosen your tongue<a name="fnB85" href="eze_note.htm#fn85"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> and you must say to them, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says.' Whoever will pay attention, let him do so, and whoever refuses to pay attention, let him refuse, for they are a rebellious house.

<p><i>Siege of Jerusalem Portrayed</i>
<p><A NAME="4"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> "And you, son of man, take a brick<a name="fnB86" href="eze_note.htm#fn86"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> and set it in front of you. Inscribe<a name="fnB87" href="eze_note.htm#fn87"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> a city on it--Jerusalem.

<bqverse 3>3 Then take an iron baking plate and set it up as an iron wall between you and the city. Set your face toward it and it will be under siege, and you will besiege it. This is a sign for the house of Israel. <p>

<bqverse 4>4 "Then lie on your left side, and place the iniquity<a name="fnB89" href="eze_note.htm#fn89"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> of the house of Israel on it. You will bear their iniquity for the number of days you lie on your side. 
<bqverse 5>5  I have set the the number of days<a name="fnB90" href="eze_note.htm#fn90"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> you will bear the iniquity of the house of Israel--three hundred ninety days<a name="fnB91" href="eze_note.htm#fn91"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a>--to correspond to the number of years of their iniquity. <p>

<bqverse 6>6  "When you have completed these days you will lie down a second time, but on your right side, and you will bear the iniquity of the house of Judah--I have assigned you forty days,<a name="fnB92" href="eze_note.htm#fn92"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> one day for each year. 
<bqverse 7>7  You will turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared,<a name="fnB93" href="eze_note.htm#fn93"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> and prophecy against it. 
<bqverse 8>8  Look,  I will tie you up with ropes, so you cannot turn from one side to the other until you complete the days of your siege.<a name="fnB94" href="eze_note.htm#fn94"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 9>9 "Take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt,<a name="fnB95" href="eze_note.htm#fn95"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> put them in a single container, and make them food<a name="fnB96" href="eze_note.htm#fn96"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> for yourself.

<bqverse 2>2 I saw a form that appeared to be a man.<a name="fnB171" href="eze_note.htm#fn171"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> From what appeared to be his waist downward he was like fire, and from his waist upward his appearance was like the brightness of a glowing substance.<a name="fnB172" href="eze_note.htm#fn172"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  The form<a name="fnB173" href="eze_note.htm#fn173"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> of a hand stretched out and took me by the hair of my head.<a name="fnB174" href="eze_note.htm#fn174"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> Then the Spirit lifted me between earth and heaven and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate which faces north--this was the location of the statue<a name="fnB175" href="eze_note.htm#fn175"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> which provokes to jealously. 
<bqverse 4>4  And the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision I had seen earlier in the valley. <p>

<bqverse 5>5  He said to me, "Son of man, look up toward<a name="fnB176" href="eze_note.htm#fn176"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> the north." And I looked up toward the north, and there at the entrance, north of the altar gate, was this statue of jealousy. <p>

<bqverse 6>6  He said to me, "Son of man, do you see what they are doing--the great abominations that the people<a name="fnB177" href="eze_note.htm#fn177"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> of Israel are practicing here, to drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see greater abominations than these." <p>

<bqverse 7>7 He brought me to the entrance of the court; and there I saw a hole in the wall. 
<bqverse 8>8  He said to me, "Son of man, dig into the wall." I dug into the wall, and there was an doorway. <p>

<bqverse 9>9  He said to me, "Go in and see the evil abominations they are practicing here." 
<bqverse 10>10  So I went in and saw the walls engraved all around with every kind of creeping thing, and beast, and detestable thing, and all the idols of the house of Israel.<a name="fnB178" href="eze_note.htm#fn178"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a>

Each had a censer in his hand, and the fragrant<a name="fnB180" href="eze_note.htm#fn180"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> cloud of incense<a name="fnB181" href="eze_note.htm#fn181"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> was swirling upward. <p>

<bqverse 12>12 He said to me, "Do you see, son of man, what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness, each in the rooms of the images?<a name="fnB182" href="eze_note.htm#fn182"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> For they think, `The LORD does not see us. The LORD has abandoned the land.'" 
<bqverse 13>13  He said to me, "You will see them practicing even greater abominations." <p>

<bqverse 14>14 Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the LORD's house, and I saw women sitting there weeping for Tammuz.<a name="fnB183" href="eze_note.htm#fn183"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  He said to me, "Do you see this, son of man? You will see even greater abominations than these." <p>

<bqverse 16>16  Then he brought me to the inner court of the LORD's house. There at the entrance to the LORD's temple, between the porch and the altar,<a name="fnB184" href="eze_note.htm#fn184"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> were about twenty-five<a name="fnB185" href="eze_note.htm#fn185"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> men facing east, with their backs to the LORD's temple,<a name="fnB186" href="eze_note.htm#fn186"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> and they were worshiping the sun<a name="fnB187" href="eze_note.htm#fn187"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> toward the east. <p>

<bqverse 17>17 He said to me, "Do you see, son of man? Is it a trivial thing that the house of Judah commits these abominations they are practicing here? For they fill the land with violence and provoked me to anger still further.

<p><A NAME="9"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Then He shouted in my hearing<a name="fnB190" href="eze_note.htm#fn190"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> with a loud voice, "Approach, you executioners of the city, each with his destructive weapon in his hand!" 
<bqverse 2>2  I saw six men<a name="fnB191" href="eze_note.htm#fn191"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> coming from the direction of the upper gate<a name="fnB192" href="eze_note.htm#fn192"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> which faces north, each with his war club in his hand. Among them was one man dressed in linen with a writing kit<a name="fnB193" href="eze_note.htm#fn193"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> at his side. They came and stood beside the bronze altar. <p>

<bqverse 3>3  Then the glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub where it had rested to the threshold of the temple.<a name="fnB194" href="eze_note.htm#fn194"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> He called to the man dressed in linen who had the writing kit at his side. 
<bqverse 4>4 And the LORD said to him, "Go through the city of Jerusalem and put a mark<a name="fnB195" href="eze_note.htm#fn195"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> on the foreheads of the men who moan and groan over all the abominations practiced in it." <p>

<bqverse 5>5  To the others he said while I listened,<a name="fnB196" href="eze_note.htm#fn196"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> "Go through the city after him and strike people down; you must neither show pity nor spare anyone!<a name="fnB197" href="eze_note.htm#fn197"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  Old men, young men, young women, little children, and women--wipe them out, all of them! But do not touch anyone who has the mark--begin at my sanctuary!" So they began with the elders who were at the front of the temple.<a name="fnB198" href="eze_note.htm#fn198"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 7>7  He said to them, "Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go!" So they went out and struck down people throughout the city. 
<bqverse 8>8  While they were killing, I was left alone, and I threw myself down with my face to the ground and cried out, "Alas, Sovereign LORD! Will you destroy the entire remnant of Israel when you pour out your furious anger on Jerusalem?" <p>

<bqverse 9>9  He said to me, "The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is extremely great; the land is filled with bloodshed, and the city is full of injustice<a name="fnB199" href="eze_note.htm#fn199"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> for they say, `The LORD has abandoned the land, and the LORD does not see!'<a name="fnB200" href="eze_note.htm#fn200"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  But as for me, my eye will not pity them nor will I spare them; I will bring down their behavior on their heads."<a name="fnB201" href="eze_note.htm#fn201"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 11>11  Then the man dressed in linen with the writing kit at his side brought back word: "I have done as you commanded me." 
<bqchapter 10>
<a name="_Toc494012809"></a></p>
<p><i>Glory of God Departs from the Temple</i>
<p><A NAME="10"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Then I saw that on the dome which was above the top of the cherubim was something like a sapphire, resembling the form of a throne in appearance. 
<bqverse 2>2  The Lord<a name="fnB202" href="eze_note.htm#fn202"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> said to the man dressed in linen, "Go into the wheelwork<a name="fnB203" href="eze_note.htm#fn203"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> underneath the cherubim,<a name="fnB204" href="eze_note.htm#fn204"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> fill your hands with burning coals from among the cherubim and scatter them<a name="fnB205" href="eze_note.htm#fn205"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> over the city." He did so as I watched. <p>

<bqverse 3>3  The cherubim were standing on the south side<a name="fnB206" href="eze_note.htm#fn206"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> of the entrance to the temple, when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court. 
<bqverse 4>4  The glory of the LORD rose up from the cherub and moved to the threshold of the temple. The temple was filled with the cloud and the court was filled with the brilliance of the glory of the LORD. 
<bqverse 5>5  The sound of the wings of the cherubim could be heard from the outer court, like the sound of the Sovereign God<a name="fnB207" href="eze_note.htm#fn207"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> when he speaks. <p>

<bqverse 6>6  When the Lord<a name="fnB208" href="eze_note.htm#fn208"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> commanded the man dressed in linen, "Take fire from within the wheelwork, from among the cherubim," the man<a name="fnB209" href="eze_note.htm#fn209"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a>went in and stood by one of the wheels. 
<bqverse 7>7  Then one of the cherubim stretched out his hand<a name="fnB210" href="eze_note.htm#fn210"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> to the fire which was among the cherubim. He took some and put it into the hands of the man dressed in linen, who took it and went back out. 
<bqverse 8>8 (The cherubim appeared to have what looked like human hands under their wings.) <p>

<bqverse 9>9  As I looked, I saw four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel beside each cherub; the wheels gleamed like chrysolite.<a name="fnB211" href="eze_note.htm#fn211"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  As for their appearance, all four of them looked the same, something like a wheel within a wheel.<a name="fnB212" href="eze_note.htm#fn212"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  When the cherubim<a name="fnB213" href="eze_note.htm#fn213"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> moved, they went in any of the four directions without turning as they moved, for in the direction the head would turn they would follow,<a name="fnB214" href="eze_note.htm#fn214"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> they would not turn as they moved. 
<bqverse 12>12  Their entire bodies,<a name="fnB215" href="eze_note.htm#fn215"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> their backs, their hands, and their wings were full of eyes all around, as were the wheels belonging to the four of them. 
<bqverse 13>13  As for their wheels, they were called "the wheelwork"<a name="fnB216" href="eze_note.htm#fn216"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> as I listened. 
<bqverse 14>14  Each of the cherubim<a name="fnB217" href="eze_note.htm#fn217"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> had four faces: the first was the face of a cherub,<a name="fnB218" href="eze_note.htm#fn218"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> the second was the face of man, the third was the face of a lion, and the fourth was the face of an eagle. <p>

<bqverse 15>15  The cherubim rose up; these were the living beings<a name="fnB219" href="eze_note.htm#fn219"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> I saw at the River Kebar. 
<bqverse 16>16  When the cherubim moved, the wheels moved beside them; when the cherubim lifted their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels did not move from their side. 
<bqverse 17>17  When the cherubim<a name="fnB220" href="eze_note.htm#fn220"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> stood still, the wheels<a name="fnB221" href="eze_note.htm#fn221"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> stood still, and when they rose up, the wheels<a name="fnB222" href="eze_note.htm#fn222"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> rose up with them, for the spirit of the living beings<a name="fnB223" href="eze_note.htm#fn223"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> was in the wheels.<a name="fnB224" href="eze_note.htm#fn224"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 18>18 Then the glory of the LORD moved away from the threshold of the temple and stopped above the cherubim. 
<bqverse 19>19  The cherubim lifted up their wings, and as I watched they rose up from the earth and the wheels went out alongside them. They stopped at the entrance to the east gate of the LORD's temple as the glory of the God of Israel hovered above them. <p>

<bqverse 20>20  These were the living creatures which I saw underneath the God of Israel at the Kebar River; I knew that they were cherubim. 
<bqverse 21>21  Each had four faces, each had four wings, and what looked like human hands under the wings. 
<bqverse 22>22  As for what their faces looked like, they were just like those I had seen at the River Kebar. Each one moved straight ahead. 
<bqchapter 11>
<a name="_Toc494012810"></a></p>
<p><i>Judgment of Leaders</i>
<p><A NAME="11"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the Lord's temple,<a name="fnB225" href="eze_note.htm#fn225"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> that faces the east. There, at the entrance of the gate, I saw twenty-five men. Among them were Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, officials of the people.<a name="fnB226" href="eze_note.htm#fn226"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2 The LORD<a name="fnB227" href="eze_note.htm#fn227"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> said to me, "Son of man, these are the men who plot iniquity and who give wicked counsel in this city. 
<bqverse 3>3  They say,<a name="fnB228" href="eze_note.htm#fn228"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> `The time is not near to build houses;<a name="fnB229" href="eze_note.htm#fn229"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> the city<a name="fnB230" href="eze_note.htm#fn230"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> is a cooking pot<a name="fnB231" href="eze_note.htm#fn231"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> and we are the meat in it.' 
<bqverse 4>4 Therefore, prophesy against them--prophesy, son of man!" <p>

<bqverse 5>5  Then the Spirit of the LORD fell on me, and he told me to say, "This is what the LORD says: This is what you are thinking,<a name="fnB232" href="eze_note.htm#fn232"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> O house of Israel; I know what goes through your minds. 
<bqverse 6>6  You have killed many people in this city; you have filled its streets with the dead. <p>

<bqverse 7>7 "Therefore, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: The corpses you have flung  in the midst of the city are the meat, and this city is the cooking pot; but I will pull you out of it.<a name="fnB233" href="eze_note.htm#fn233"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  You have feared the sword, so I will bring the sword against you,' declares the Sovereign LORD. 
<bqverse 9>9 `</b>I will drag you out of the city and hand you over to strangers, and I will execute judgments against you. 
<bqverse 10>10  You will fall by the sword; I will judge you at the border of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 
<bqverse 11>11  This city<a name="fnB234" href="eze_note.htm#fn234"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> will not be a cooking pot for you, and you will not be meat within it; I will judge you at the border of Israel. 
<bqverse 12>12  Then you will know that I am the LORD, whose decrees you have not followed and whose laws you have not obeyed. Instead you have behaved according to the laws of the nations around you!" <p>

<bqverse 13>13  Now, while I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I threw myself down with  my face to the ground and cried out with a loud voice, "O Sovereign LORD! Will you completely wipe out what remains of Israel?" <p>

<bqverse 14>14 Then the word of the LORD came to me: 
<bqverse 15>15  "Son of man, your brothers, your relatives, your fellow exiles,<a name="fnB235" href="eze_note.htm#fn235"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> and the whole house of Israel are those to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, `They have gone far away from the LORD; to us this land has been given as a possession.' <p>

<bqverse 16>16 "Therefore say: `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Although I have removed them far away among the nations and have scattered them through foreign countries, I have been a sanctuary for them for a short while<a name="fnB236" href="eze_note.htm#fn236"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> among the countries where they have gone.' <p>

<bqverse 17>17 "Therefore say: `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will regather you from the peoples and will assemble you from the countries where you have been dispersed, and I will give you back the land of Israel.' <p>

<bqverse 18>18 "When they return to it, they will remove all its detestable things and all its abominations. 
<bqverse 19>19  I will give them one heart and I will put a new spirit within them;<a name="fnB237" href="eze_note.htm#fn237"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> I will remove the heart of stone from their bodies<a name="fnB238" href="eze_note.htm#fn238"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> and I will give them a heart of flesh, 
<bqverse 20>20  so that they will obey my statues and guard my ordinances and observe them. Then they will be my people, and I will be their God.<a name="fnB239" href="eze_note.htm#fn239"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  But those whose hearts are devoted to detestable things and abominations, I will bring their behavior down on their own head, says the Sovereign LORD." <p>

<bqverse 22>22  Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, with their wheels alongside them, while the glory of the God of Israel hovered above them. 
<bqverse 23>23  The glory of the LORD rose up from within the city and stopped<a name="fnB240" href="eze_note.htm#fn240"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> over the mountain east of it. 
<bqverse 24>24  Then the Spirit lifted me and carried me to the exiles in Babylonia,<a name="fnB241" href="eze_note.htm#fn241"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> in the vision<a name="fnB242" href="eze_note.htm#fn242"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> given to me by the Spirit of God. <p>
Then the vision I had seen went up away from me. 
<bqverse 25>25  So I told the exiles everything the LORD had shown me. 
<bqchapter 12>
<a name="_Toc494012811"></a></p>
<p><i>The Exile Symbolized</i>
<p><A NAME="12"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> The word of the LORD came to me: 
<bqverse 2>2  "Son of man, you are living in the midst of a rebellious people.<a name="fnB243" href="eze_note.htm#fn243"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> They have eyes to see but do not see, and ears to hear but do not hear,<a name="fnB244" href="eze_note.htm#fn244"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> because they are a rebellious people. <p>

<bqverse 3>3  "Therefore, son of man, pack up your belongings as if you were going into exile, and go into exile during the day, while they are watching. Go into exile from where you live to another place. Perhaps they will get the message, although they are a rebellious people. 
<bqverse 4>4  During the day, while they are watching, carry out your belongings packed to go into exile. Go out at evening, while they are watching, as though you were going out to exile. 
<bqverse 5>5  Dig for yourself a hole in the wall while they are watching and carry your belongings out through it. 
<bqverse 6>6 While they are watching, lift up your baggage on your shoulder and carry it out in the dark.<a name="fnB245" href="eze_note.htm#fn245"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> You must cover your face so that you cannot see the land, because I have made you a sign<a name="fnB246" href="eze_note.htm#fn246"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> to the house of Israel." <p>

<bqverse 7>7  So I did just as I was commanded. During the day I carried out my belongings packed to go into exile, and at evening I dug myself a hole through the wall with my hands. I went out in the darkness, carrying my baggage<a name="fnB247" href="eze_note.htm#fn247"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> on my shoulder while they watched. <p>

<bqverse 8>8  The word of the LORD came to me in the morning: 
<bqverse 9>9  "Son of man, has not the house of Israel, that rebellious people,<a name="fnB248" href="eze_note.htm#fn248"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> said to you, `What are you doing?' 
<bqverse 10>10  Say to them, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: This prophetic oracle<a name="fnB249" href="eze_note.htm#fn249"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> concerns the prince in Jerusalem<a name="fnB250" href="eze_note.htm#fn250"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> and all the house of Israel within it.' 
<bqverse 11>11  Say, `I am a sign for you, just as I have done, it will be done to them: they will go into exile--into captivity.' <p>

<bqverse 12>12  "The prince<a name="fnB251" href="eze_note.htm#fn251"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> who is among them will carry his belongings<a name="fnB252" href="eze_note.htm#fn252"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> on his shoulder in darkness, and will go out. They<a name="fnB253" href="eze_note.htm#fn253"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> will dig a hole in the wall for him to go out through. He will cover his face so that he cannot see the land with his eyes. 
<bqverse 13>13  But I will spread my net over him, and he will be captured in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans<a name="fnB254" href="eze_note.htm#fn254"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> (but he will not see it),<a name="fnB255" href="eze_note.htm#fn255"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> and there he will die.<a name="fnB256" href="eze_note.htm#fn256"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  All his retinue--his attendants and his troops--I will scatter to every wind; I will chase them with a drawn sword. <p>

<bqverse 15>15  "And when I disperse them among the nations, and scatter them among foreign countries, they will know that I am the LORD. 
<bqverse 16>16  But I will let a small number of them survive the sword, famine, and pestilence, so that they can confess all their abominable practices to the nations where they go. Then they will know that I am the LORD." <p>

<bqverse 17>17  The word of the LORD came to me: 
<bqverse 18>18 "Son of man, tremble<a name="fnB257" href="eze_note.htm#fn257"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> while you eat your bread, and drink your water while you shake with anxiety. 
<bqverse 19>19  Then say to the people of the land, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says about the inhabitants of Jerusalem and of the land of Israel: They will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water in despair, for their land will be stripped bare of all it contains because of the violence of all who live in it. 
<bqverse 20>20  The inhabited towns will be left in ruins and the land will be devastated. Then you will know that I am the LORD.'" <p>

<bqverse 21>21 The word of the LORD came to me: 
<bqverse 22>22  "Son of man, what is this proverb you have in the land of Israel, `The days pass slowly, and every vision comes to nothing'? 
<bqverse 23>23  Therefore tell them, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will put an end<a name="fnB258" href="eze_note.htm#fn258"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> to this proverb--they will not use it as a proverb in Israel any longer.' But say to them, `The days are at hand when every vision will be fulfilled.<a name="fnB259" href="eze_note.htm#fn259"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  For there will no longer be any false visions or flattering divinations among the people<a name="fnB260" href="eze_note.htm#fn260"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> of Israel. 
<bqverse 25>25  But I--the LORD--will speak whatever word I want to speak, and it will be accomplished. It will not be delayed any longer; for in your days, you rebellious people,<a name="fnB261" href="eze_note.htm#fn261"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> I will speak the word and will accomplish it, declares the Sovereign LORD.'" <p>

<bqverse 26>26  The word of the LORD came to me: 
<bqverse 27>27  "Son of man, the house of Israel is saying, `The vision that he sees is a long time from now; he is prophesying about the distant future.' 
<bqverse 28>28  Therefore say to them, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: None of my words will be delayed any longer! The word I speak will be accomplished, declares the Sovereign LORD.'"

<a name="_Toc494012812"></a></p>
<p><i>False Prophets Condemned</i>
<p><A NAME="13"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Then the word of the LORD came to me: 
<bqverse 2>2  "Son of man, prophecy against the prophets of Israel who are now prophesying. Say to the prophets who prophecy from their own imagination:<a name="fnB262" href="eze_note.htm#fn262"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> `Hear the word of the LORD! 
<bqverse 3>3  This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Woe to the foolish<a name="fnB263" href="eze_note.htm#fn263"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing at all! 
<bqverse 4>4 Your prophets have become like jackals among the ruins, O Israel. 
<bqverse 5>5  You have not gone up in the breaks in the wall, nor repaired a wall for the house of Israel so it will stand strong in the battle on the day of the LORD. 
<bqverse 6>6  Instead, their visions are false and their divination is a lie.<a name="fnB264" href="eze_note.htm#fn264"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> They say, "declares the LORD," though the LORD has not sent them;<a name="fnB265" href="eze_note.htm#fn265"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> yet they expect the fulfillment of their word. 
<bqverse 7>7  Have you not seen a false vision and uttered a lying divination when you say, "declares the LORD," although I never spoke a word? <p>

<bqverse 8>8  "`Therefore, thus says the Sovereign LORD: Because you have spoken false words and seen lying visions, I am against you, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
<bqverse 9>9  My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and speak lying divinations. They will not be included in the council<a name="fnB266" href="eze_note.htm#fn266"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> of my people, nor be written in the registry<a name="fnB267" href="eze_note.htm#fn267"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> of the house of Israel, nor enter the land of Israel.

<bqverse 10>10  "`Because, indeed, they have led my people astray saying, "Peace," when there is no peace; and when anyone builds a wall they coat it with whitewash. 
<bqverse 11>11  Tell the ones who coat it with whitewash that it is going to fall. There will be a deluge of rain, great hailstones<a name="fnB268" href="eze_note.htm#fn268"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> will fall, and a violent wind will break out.<a name="fnB269" href="eze_note.htm#fn269"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12 When the wall has collapsed, won't people ask you, "Where is the whitewash you coated it with?" <p>

<bqverse 13>13  "`Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: In my fury I will make a violent wind break out, and in my anger a deluge of rain, and hailstones in destructive fury. 
<bqverse 14>14  I will break down the wall you coated with whitewash, and level it to the ground so that its foundation is exposed. When it falls you will be destroyed beneath it,<a name="fnB270" href="eze_note.htm#fn270"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> and you will know that I am the LORD. 
<bqverse 15>15  I will spend my fury against the wall, and against those who coated it with whitewash. Then I will say to you, "The wall is no more and those who whitewashed it are no more-- 
<bqverse 16>16  those prophets of Israel who prophesied about Jerusalem and saw visions of peace for it, when there was no peace," declares the Sovereign LORD.' <p>

<bqverse 17>17 "As for you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people who are prophesying from their own imagination. Prophecy against them 
<bqverse 18>18  and say `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Woe to those who sew bands<a name="fnB271" href="eze_note.htm#fn271"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> on all their wrists and make veils for heads of every size to entrap people! Will you entrap my people, yet preserve your own lives? 
<bqverse 19>19  You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and scraps of bread. By your lies to my people, who listen to lies, you have put to death people<a name="fnB272" href="eze_note.htm#fn272"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> who should not die and kept alive those who should not live. <p>

<bqverse 20>20  "`Therefore, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against your wristbands with which you entrap people like birds--I will tear them from your arms and will free the people you hunt like birds. 
<bqverse 21>21  I will tear off your veils and rescue my people from your power;<a name="fnB273" href="eze_note.htm#fn273"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> they will no longer be prey in your hands. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 
<bqverse 22>22  Because you have disheartened the righteous with lies (although I have not disheartened them), and because you have encouraged the wicked person not to turn from his evil conduct and thus preserve his life, 
<bqverse 23>23  therefore you will no longer see false visions and practice divination. I will rescue my people from your power, and you<a name="fnB274" href="eze_note.htm#fn274"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> will know that I am the LORD.'"

<p><i>God's Just Judgments</i>
<p><A NAME="14"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Then some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat down in front of me. 
<bqverse 2>2  The word of the LORD came to me: 
<bqverse 3>3  "Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their hearts and placed the stumbling block of their iniquity<a name="fnB275" href="eze_note.htm#fn275"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> right before their faces. Should I allow them to seek<a name="fnB276" href="eze_note.htm#fn276"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> me at all? 
<bqverse 4>4 Therefore speak to them and say to them, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: When any one from the house of Israel sets up his idols in his heart and places the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and then consults a prophet, I the LORD will answer him myself according to the multitude of his idols, 
<bqverse 5>5 in order to capture the hearts of the house of Israel, who are estranged from me on account of all their idols.' <p>

<bqverse 6>6 "Therefore say to the house of Israel, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Repent! Abandon<a name="fnB277" href="eze_note.htm#fn277"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> your idols; and turn away<a name="fnB278" href="eze_note.htm#fn278"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> from your abominable practices. 
<bqverse 7>7  For when anyone from the house of Israel, or the foreigner who lives in Israel, separates himself from me and sets up his idols in his heart and places the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and then consults a prophet to ask something from me for him, I the LORD will answer him myself. 
<bqverse 8>8  I will set my face against that man and will make him an example and a byword,<a name="fnB279" href="eze_note.htm#fn279"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and will cut him off from among my people. Then you will know that I am the LORD. <p>

<bqverse 9>9  "`As for the prophet, if he is enticed to speak a prophetic word, I, the LORD, have enticed that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him and destroy him from among my people Israel. 
<bqverse 10>10  They will bear their punishment;<a name="fnB280" href="eze_note.htm#fn280"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> the punishment of the one who inquired will be the same as the punishment of the prophet. 
<bqverse 11>11  Thus that the house of Israel will no longer go astray from me, nor defile themselves again by all their transgressions. They will be my people and I will be their God,<a name="fnB281" href="eze_note.htm#fn281"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> declares the Sovereign LORD.'" <p>

<bqverse 12>12  The word of the LORD came to me: 
<bqverse 13>13  "Son of man, when a country sins against me by acting faithlessly,<a name="fnB282" href="eze_note.htm#fn282"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> and I stretch out my hand against it, and break its staff of bread, cause it to experience famine, and kill both man and beast in it, 
<bqverse 14>14  even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would save only their own lives by their righteousness, declares the Sovereign LORD. <p>

<bqverse 15>15  "If I were to send wild animals through the land and they killed its children, and it became desolate so that no one traveled across it because of the animals, 
<bqverse 16>16  as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, even if these three men were in it, they could not save their own sons or daughters; they would save only their own lives, and the land would be devastated. <p>

<bqverse 17>17  "Or if I were to bring the sword of war against that land and say, `Let a sword pass through the land,' and I kill both man and beast in it, 
<bqverse 18>18  even though these three men were in it, as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, they could not save their own sons or daughters, they would save only their own lives. <p>

<bqverse 19>19  "Or if I should send a pestilence into that land, and poured out my furious anger on it with bloodshed, to kill both man and beast in it, 
<bqverse 20>20 even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, they could not save their own sons or daughters; they would save only their own lives by their righteousness. <p>

<bqverse 21>21  "For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: How much worse will it be when I send my four terrible<a name="fnB283" href="eze_note.htm#fn283"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> judgments--sword, famine, wild animals, and plague--against Jerusalem to kill both man and beast in it! 
<bqverse 22>22  Yet some survivors will be left in it, sons and daughters who are brought out. They will come out to you, and when you see their behavior and their deeds, you will be consoled about the catastrophe I have brought on Jerusalem--for everything I brought on it. 
<bqverse 23>23  They will console you when you see their behavior and their deeds, because you will know that it was not without reason that I have done what I have done in it, declares the Sovereign LORD."

<bqverse 5>5 If it was not made into anything useful when it was whole, how much less can it be useful for anything when the fire has burned it up and it is charred? <p>

<bqverse 4>4  As for your birth, on the day you were born, your umbilical cord was not cut, nor were you washed in water for cleansing; you were not rubbed with salt, nor wrapped with clothes.<a name="fnB288" href="eze_note.htm#fn288"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  No eye had pity on you to do any of these things for you out of compassion for you; you were thrown out into the open<a name="fnB289" href="eze_note.htm#fn289"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> field<a name="fnB290" href="eze_note.htm#fn290"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> because you were detested on the day you were born. <p>

<bqverse 6>6  "`I passed by you and saw you kicking around in your blood. I said to you as you lay there in your blood, "Live!" I said to you as you lay there in your blood, "Live!" 
<bqverse 7>7  I made you abundant like plants in the field, and you grew and became tall and arrived at the age for fine ornaments.<a name="fnB291" href="eze_note.htm#fn291"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> Your breasts had formed and your hair had grown, but you were still naked and bare. <p>

I swore a solemn oath to you and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Sovereign LORD, and you became mine. <p>

<bqverse 9>9 "`Then I bathed you in water and washed away the blood on you and anointed you with fragrant oil. 
<bqverse 10>10  I dressed you in embroidered clothing and put sandals made of fine leather on your feet. I bound you with fine linen and covered you with silk. 
<bqverse 11>11  I adorned you with jewelry--I put bracelets on your hands, a necklace around your neck, 
<bqverse 12>12  a ring in your nose, earrings on your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head. 
<bqverse 13>13  You were adorned with gold and silver, while your clothing was of fine linen, silk, and embroidery. You ate the finest flour, honey, and olive oil. You became extremely beautiful and attained the standing of royalty. 
<bqverse 14>14 Your fame<a name="fnB294" href="eze_note.htm#fn294"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> spread among the nations because of your beauty, for your beauty was perfect because of my splendor which I bestowed on you, declares the Sovereign LORD. <p>

<bqverse 15>15  "`But you trusted in your beauty and became a prostitute by capitalizing on your fame. You gave your sexual favors freely to every passer-by--your beauty became his! 
<bqverse 16>16  You took some of your clothing and made for yourself brightly colored high places and engaged in acts of prostitution on them--such things have never happened nor will ever happen again! 
<bqverse 17>17  You also took your beautiful jewels, some of my gold and my silver I had given to you, and made for yourself male images and engaged in prostitution<a name="fnB295" href="eze_note.htm#fn295"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> with them. 
<bqverse 18>18 You took your embroidered clothing and used it to cover them, and you offered my oil and my incense before them. 
<bqverse 19>19  Also my food that I gave you--the fine flour, olive oil, and honey I fed you with--you placed these things before them as a soothing aroma. That is exactly what happened, declares the Sovereign LORD. <p>

<bqverse 20>20  "`You took your sons and your daughters whom you bore to me and you sacrificed them<a name="fnB296" href="eze_note.htm#fn296"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> as food for the idols to eat. As if your prostitution was not enough,

<bqverse 22>22  But with all your abominable practices and prostitution you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, kicking around in your blood. <p>

<bqverse 23>23  "`After all of your evil-- Woe! Woe to you declares the Sovereign LORD-- 
<bqverse 24>24  you built yourself a platform and made for yourself a lofty place in every public square. 
<bqverse 25>25  At the head of every street you built your lofty place and you made your beauty disgusting when you spread<a name="fnB298" href="eze_note.htm#fn298"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> your legs to every one who passed by, multiplying your prostitution endlessly. 
<bqverse 26>26 You engaged in prostitution with the Egyptians, your sexually aroused neighbors, increasing your promiscuity to provoke me to anger. 
<bqverse 27>27  So I have stretched out my hand against you and cut your rations. I have delivered you into the power of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who were shocked by your obscene conduct. 
<bqverse 28>28  You engaged in prostitution with the Assyrians because your sexual desires were insatiable; you prostituted yourself with them and yet you were still not satisfied. 
<bqverse 29>29  Then you extended your promiscuity to the land of merchants, Chaldea, but you were not satisfied there either. <p>

<bqverse 30>30  "`How sick is your heart, declares the Sovereign LORD, when you performed all of these acts, the deeds of an arrogant prostitute. 
<bqverse 31>31  When you built your platform at the head of every street and made your lofty place at every public square, you were not like a prostitute, because you scoffed at payment.<a name="fnB299" href="eze_note.htm#fn299"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 34>34  You were different from other women in your prostitution because no one solicited you--you gave payment and no payment was given to you--yes, you were different!<p>

<bqverse 35>35  "`Therefore O prostitute, hear the word of the LORD: 
<bqverse 36>36 This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because your lust<a name="fnB301" href="eze_note.htm#fn301"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> was poured out and your nakedness was uncovered in your prostitution with all your lovers, and because of all your detestable idols, and because of the blood of your sons you have given to them, 
<bqverse 37>37 therefore, I am gathering all your lovers with whom you took pleasure and all whom you loved and all whom you have hated; I will gather them against you from all around, and I will expose your nakedness to them, and they will see all your nakedness.<a name="fnB302" href="eze_note.htm#fn302"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 38>38  I will judge you with the judgments due an adulterer and one who sheds blood. I will bring blood on you with furious anger and passion. 
<bqverse 39>39 I will give you into their hands and they will destroy your platforms and tear down your lofty places. They will strip you of your clothing and take your beautiful jewelry and leave you naked and bare. 
<bqverse 40>40  They will summon a mob who will stone you and hack you in pieces with their swords. 
<bqverse 41>41  They will burn down your houses and execute judgments on you in front of many women. Then I will put a stop to your prostitution, and you will no longer pay your clients. 
<bqverse 42>42 I will exhaust my furious anger against you and my fury will turn from you; then I will be calmed and be angered no longer. <p>

<bqverse 43>43 "`Because you did not remember the days of your youth and enraged me by all these deeds, I in turn will bring your behavior down on your own head, declares the Sovereign LORD. Have you not engaged in prostitution on top of all your other abominable practices? <p>

<bqverse 44>44  "`Now everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb about you: "Like mother, like daughter." 
<bqverse 45>45 You are the daughter of your mother, who detested her husband and her sons; and you are the sister of your sisters who detested their husbands and their sons. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite. 
<bqverse 46>46  Your older sister was Samaria, who lived north<a name="fnB303" href="eze_note.htm#fn303"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> of you with her daughters; and your younger sister,<a name="fnB304" href="eze_note.htm#fn304"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> who lives south<a name="fnB305" href="eze_note.htm#fn305"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> of you, was Sodom<a name="fnB306" href="eze_note.htm#fn306"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> with her daughters. 
<bqverse 47>47 You not only copied their behavior and practiced their abominable deeds, but in a short time<a name="fnB307" href="eze_note.htm#fn307"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> you were more depraved in all your conduct than they. 
<bqverse 48>48  As I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, your sister Sodom and her daughters never behaved as wickedly<a name="fnB308" href="eze_note.htm#fn308"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> as you and your daughters have done. <p>

<bqverse 49>49  "`This was the sin<a name="fnB309" href="eze_note.htm#fn309"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, abundance of food, and careless ease, but did not help<a name="fnB310" href="eze_note.htm#fn310"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> the poor and needy. 
<bqverse 50>50  They were haughty and committed abominable crimes before me. Therefore, when I saw it, I removed them. 
<bqverse 51>51 Samaria has not committed half the sins you have; you have done more abominable deeds than they, and have made your sisters appear more righteous by all the abominable things you have done. 
<bqverse 52>52  So now, bear your disgrace, because you have intervened on behalf of your sisters. Because the sins you have committed were more abominable than those of your sisters; they have become more righteous than you. So now, be ashamed and bear your disgrace in making your sisters appear more righteous. <p>

<bqverse 53>53 "`However, I will restore their fortunes, the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters (along with your fortunes among them) 
<bqverse 54>54 so that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all you have done when you become a comfort to them. 
<bqverse 55>55 As for your sisters, Sodom and her daughters will be restored to their former status, Samaria and her daughters will be restored to their former status, and you and your daughters will be restored to your former status. 
<bqverse 56>56 In your days of pride, was not Sodom your sister a byword in your mouth, 
<bqverse 57>57  before your evil was exposed? Now you have become an object of scorn to the daughters of Aram<a name="fnB311" href="eze_note.htm#fn311"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> and all those around her and to the daughters of the Philistines--those all around you who despise you. 
<bqverse 58>58  You must bear your punishment for your lewdness and your abominable practices, declares the LORD. <p>

<bqverse 59>59 "`For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will deal with you according to what you have done when you despised your oath by breaking your covenant. 
<bqverse 60>60  Yet I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an eternal covenant with you. 
<bqverse 61>61 Then you will remember your conduct, and be ashamed when you receive your older sisters and younger sisters. I will give them to you as daughters, but not on account of my covenant with you. 
<bqverse 62>62  I will establish my covenant with you, and then you will know that I am the LORD, 
<bqverse 63>63  so that when I make atonement for you for all you have done, you may remember and be ashamed and never open your mouth again because of your shame, declares the Sovereign LORD.'"

<p><i>Two Eagles and a Vine</i>

<bqverse 2>2  "Son of man, offer a riddle,<a name="fnB312" href="eze_note.htm#fn312"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> and tell a parable to the house of Israel. 
<bqverse 3>3  Say to them: `This is what the Sovereign LORD says:<a name="fnB313" href="eze_note.htm#fn313"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a></p>
<br>"`A great eagle<a name="fnB314" href="eze_note.htm#fn314"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> with broad wings, long feathers, and thick, many-colored plumage came to Lebanon<a name="fnB315" href="eze_note.htm#fn315"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> and took the top of the cedar. <br>

<bqverse 4>4 He plucked its topmost shoot;<a name="fnB316" href="eze_note.htm#fn316"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a><br>
brought it to a land of merchants, <br>
and planted it in a city of traders. <br>

<bqverse 5>5  He took a seed<a name="fnB317" href="eze_note.htm#fn317"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> from the land, <br>
placed it in fertile soil;<a name="fnB318" href="eze_note.htm#fn318"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> <br>
a plant by many waters, he planted it like a willow. <br>

<bqverse 6>6 It sprouted and became a spreading vine of low stature; <br>
its branches turned toward him, and its roots were under him. <br>
So it became a vine, it brought forth shoots and sent forth branches. <br>

<bqverse 7>7 "`There was another great eagle,<a name="fnB319" href="eze_note.htm#fn319"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> with broadwings and thick plumage. <br>
Now this vine stretched out its roots toward him, and sent its branches toward him, to be watered from the bed where it was planted. <br>

<bqverse 8>8 In a good field, by abundant waters, it was transplanted to produce branches and bear fruit to become a noble vine. </ul><p>
<bqverse 9>9 "`Say to them: This is what the Sovereign LORD says: </p>

Every leaf it sprouted will wither, and no strong arm or large army will be needed to pull it out by its roots. <br>

<bqverse 10>10  Although it is transplanted, will it prosper? <br>
Will it not wither completely when the east wind blows on it? <br>
Will it not wither in the bed where it grew?'"</ul><p>	<p>

I will pluck from the top one of its tender twigs; <br>
I myself will plant it on a high and lofty mountain. <br>

<bqverse 23>23  I will plant it on a high mountain of Israel, <br>
and it will send forth branches and produce fruit and become a noble cedar. <br>
Every bird of every kind will live under it; <br>
in the shade of its branches they will live. <br>

<bqverse 24>24 And all the trees of the field will know that I, the LORD, have brought low the high tree, raised up the low tree, withered the green tree and made the dry tree sprout.<br>
I, the LORD have spoken, and I will carry it out.'"

<p><i>Two Sisters</i>
<p><A NAME="23"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>The word of the LORD came to me: 
<bqverse 2>2 "Son of man, there were two sisters, the daughters of the same mother. 
<bqverse 3>3 They engaged in prostitution in Egypt; they engaged in prostitution in their youth. There their breasts were pressed, and their virgin breasts were fondled. 
<bqverse 4>4 Oholah was the name of the older and Oholibah<a name="fnB430" href="eze_note.htm#fn430"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> the name of her younger sister. They became mine, and gave birth to sons and daughters. Oholah<a name="fnB431" href="eze_note.htm#fn431"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> is Samaria and Oholibah is Jerusalem. <p>

<bqverse 5>5 "Oholah engaged in prostitution while she was mine.<a name="fnB432" href="eze_note.htm#fn432"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> She lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians--warriors 
<bqverse 6>6 clothed in blue, governors and officials, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses. 
<bqverse 7>7 She bestowed her sexual favors on them; all of them were the choicest young men of Assyria.<a name="fnB433" href="eze_note.htm#fn433"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> She defiled herself with all whom she lusted after--with all their idols. 
<bqverse 8>8 She did not abandon the promiscuity she had practiced in Egypt; for in her youth men had sex with her and fondled her virgin breasts and poured out their lust<a name="fnB434" href="eze_note.htm#fn434"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> on her. 
<bqverse 9>9 Therefore I delivered her into the power of her lovers, into the power of the sons of Assyria for whom she lusted. 
<bqverse 10>10 They uncovered her nakedness; they seized her sons and daughters; and they killed her with the sword. She became a byword<a name="fnB435" href="eze_note.htm#fn435"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> among women, and judgments were executed against her. <p>

<bqverse 11>11 "Her sister Oholibah saw this,<a name="fnB436" href="eze_note.htm#fn436"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> and she became more corrupt in her lust than her sister had been, and her promiscuous acts were more numerous than those of her sister. 
<bqverse 12>12  She lusted after the Assyrians--governors and officials, warriors in full armor, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men. 
<bqverse 13>13 And I saw that she was defiled; both of them followed the same path. 
<bqverse 14>14 But she increased her promiscuity; she saw men carved on the wall, images of the Chaldeans carved in bright red,<a name="fnB437" href="eze_note.htm#fn437"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15 girded with belts on their waists and flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like officers, the image of Babylonians<a name="fnB438" href="eze_note.htm#fn438"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> whose native land is Chaldea. 
<bqverse 16>16 When she saw them,<a name="fnB439" href="eze_note.htm#fn439"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.<a name="fnB440" href="eze_note.htm#fn440"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17 And the Babylonians came to her--to her bed of love. They defiled her with their lust;<a name="fnB441" href="eze_note.htm#fn441"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> and after she defiled herself with them, she<a name="fnB442" href="eze_note.htm#fn442"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> became disgusted with them. 
<bqverse 18>18 When she uncovered her promiscuity and her nakedness, I<a name="fnB443" href="eze_note.htm#fn443"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> was disgusted with her, just as I<a name="fnB444" href="eze_note.htm#fn444"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> had been disgusted with her sister. 
<bqverse 19>19 Yet she increased her promiscuity, remembering the days of her youth when she engaged in prostitution in the land of Egypt 
<bqverse 20>20 and lusted after their paramours whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose seminal emission was like that of horses. 
<bqverse 21>21 Thus you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians fondled your breasts because of your youth. <p>

<bqverse 22>22 "Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Sovereign LORD: I will stir up against you your lovers with whom you were disgusted, and I will bring them against you from every side: 
<bqverse 23>23 the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, desirable young men, governors and officials all of them, officers and nobles, all of them riding on horses. 
<bqverse 24>24 They will all come against you with weapons,<a name="fnB445" href="eze_note.htm#fn445"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> chariots, wagons, and with a huge army<a name="fnB446" href="eze_note.htm#fn446"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a>; they will array themselves against you on every side with large shield, small shield, and helmet, and I will commit the punishment to them and they will punish you according to their laws. 
<bqverse 25>25 I will direct<a name="fnB447" href="eze_note.htm#fn447"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> my jealousy against you, so that they may deal with you in furious anger. They will cut off your nose and your ears,<a name="fnB448" href="eze_note.htm#fn448"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> and your survivors will die by the sword. They will take your sons and your daughters, and your survivors will be consumed by fire. 
<bqverse 26>26 They will also strip your clothes off you and take away your beautiful jewelry. 
<bqverse 27>27 So I will put an end to your lewdness and your promiscuity from the land of Egypt; you will not petition them, or remember Egypt anymore. <p>

<bqverse 28>28 "For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am giving you into the hand of those whom you hate, into the hand of those with whom you were disgusted; 
<bqverse 29>29 and they will deal with you in hatred, take away all you have worked for,<a name="fnB449" href="eze_note.htm#fn449"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> leave you naked and bare, and the nakedness of your prostitution will be exposed. Your lewdness and your promiscuity 
<bqverse 30>30 have brought this upon you, because you engaged in prostitution with the nations, because you polluted yourself with their idols. 
<bqverse 31>31 You have followed the conduct of your sister; thus I will place her cup<a name="fnB450" href="eze_note.htm#fn450"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> in your hand. <p>

<bqverse 32>32 "This is what the Sovereign LORD says:</p>
<br> "You will drink the cup of your sister, deep and wide;<br>
you will be scorned and derided, for it holds so much.<br>

<bqverse 33>33 You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow.<br>
The cup of your sister Samaria is a cup of horror and desolation;<br>

<bqverse 34>34 you will drink it and you will drain it, and break in in pieces,<br>
and tear out your breasts;<a name="fnB451" href="eze_note.htm#fn451"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a></ul><p>for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD. <p>

<bqverse 35>35 "Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because you have forgotten me and cast me behind your back, you must bear now the punishment<a name="fnB452" href="eze_note.htm#fn452"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> of your lewdness and your promiscuity."<p>

<bqverse 36>36 The LORD said to me: "Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominable deeds. 
<bqverse 37>37 For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands; they have committed adultery with their idols; and the sons they have given me, they have sacrificed to them for food.<a name="fnB453" href="eze_note.htm#fn453"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 38>38 Moreover, they have done this to me: they have defiled my sanctuary on the same day, and profaned my Sabbaths. 
<bqverse 39>39 For on the same day they slaughtered their sons for their idols, they came to my sanctuary to defile it. This is what they have done in my house. <p>

<bqverse 40>40 "They even sent for men from far away, sending a messenger, and they came. For them you bathed, painted your eyes, and decorated yourself with jewelry. 
<bqverse 41>41 You sat on a magnificent couch, with a table arranged in front of it where you placed my incense and my oil. 
<bqverse 42>42 The sound of a carefree crowd was with her, and Sabeans<a name="fnB454" href="eze_note.htm#fn454"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> were brought from the wilderness with lower-class men; and they put bracelets on their hands and beautiful crowns on their heads. 
<bqverse 43>43 Then I said about the one worn out by adulteries, `Now they will carry out their immoral acts with her. 
<bqverse 44>44 For they have had sex with her as one does with a prostitute.' Thus they have gone to Oholah and to Oholibah, promiscuous women. 
<bqverse 45>45 But righteous men will judge them with the judgment of adulteries and those who shed blood; because they are adulteresses and blood is on their hands. <p>

<bqverse 46>46 "For thus says the Sovereign LORD: Bring up an army<a name="fnB455" href="eze_note.htm#fn455"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> against them and give them over to terror and plunder. 
<bqverse 47>47 That army will stone them with stones and cut them down with their swords; they will kill their sons and daughters and burn their houses with fire. 
<bqverse 48>48 Thus I will put an end to the promiscuity in the land, that all the women may take warning and not carry out promiscuous actions. 
<bqverse 49>49 They will repay you for your promiscuity, and you will bear the sins of your idols. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign LORD."

<bqverse 19>19 Say to them, `Whom do you surpass in beauty?<a name="fnB561" href="eze_note.htm#fn561"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> Go down and be laid to rest with the uncircumcised!' 
<bqverse 20>20 They will fall among those killed by the sword. The sword is drawn; let them carry her and all her hordes away. 
<bqverse 21>21 The valiant among the mighty men will speak from the midst of Sheol to Egypt and her accomplices: `They have come down, they lie still, the uncircumcised, killed by the sword.' <p>

<bqverse 22>22 "Assyria is there and all her assembly, their graves are all around it, all of them killed by the sword, fallen by the sword,

<bqverse 25>25 They have made a bed for her in the midst of the dead with all her hordes, their graves all around it, all of them uncircumcised, killed by the sword; because their terror had spread in the land of the living, and they will bear their shame along with those who descend to the pit; they are placed among the dead. <p>

<bqverse 26>26 "Meshech and Tubal are there, and all her hordes, her graves all around it, all of them uncircumcised, killed by the sword; for they caused terror in the land of the living.

<p><i>Ezekiel Israel's Watchman</i>
<p><A NAME="33"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>The word of the LORD came to me: 
<bqverse 2>2 "Son of man, speak to the sons of your people, and say to them, `If I bring a sword on the land, and the people of the land take one man from their number and make him their watchman, 
<bqverse 3>3 and if he sees the sword coming against the land and blows the trumpet and warns the people,<a name="fnB564" href="eze_note.htm#fn564"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4 then one hears the sound of the trumpet and does not take warning, and the sword comes and takes him away, his blood will be on his own head. 
<bqverse 5>5 He heard the sound of the trumpet and did not take warning; his blood will be on himself. But if he had taken warning, he would have saved his life. 
<bqverse 6>6 But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet so that the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes the life of one of them, he is taken in his iniquity, but I will hold the watchman accountable for that person's death.' <p>

<bqverse 7>7 "So, son of man, I have made you a watchman<a name="fnB565" href="eze_note.htm#fn565"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> for the house of Israel--whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you will give them a warning from me. 
<bqverse 8>8 When I say to the wicked, `O wicked man, you will certainly die,'<a name="fnB566" href="eze_note.htm#fn566"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> and you do not speak to warn the wicked of his conduct, the wicked man will die in his iniquity, but I will hold you accountable for his death. 
<bqverse 9>9 But if you warn the wicked man to turn from his conduct, and he does not turn from his conduct, he will die in his iniquity, but you have saved your own life. <p>

<bqverse 10>10 "Now you, son of man, say to the house of Israel, `Thus you have said,: "Our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we are wasting away because of them; how can we then live?"' 
<bqverse 11>11 Say to them, `As I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but prefer that the wicked turn from his conduct and live--turn back, turn back from your evil conduct! Why will you die, O house of Israel?' <p>

<bqverse 12>12 "And you, son of man, say to the sons of your people, `The righteousness of the righteous will not deliver him in the day of his transgression; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he will not stumble on account of it on the day he turns from his wickedness; and the righteous will not be able to live by his righteousness<a name="fnB567" href="eze_note.htm#fn567"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> on the day he commits sin.' 
<bqverse 13>13 When I say to the righteous that he will certainly live, yet he trusts in his righteousness and commits iniquity, none of his righteous deeds will be remembered; on account of the iniquity he has committed he will die. 
<bqverse 14>14 But when I say to the wicked, `You will certainly die,' yet he turns from his sin and practices justice and righteousness-- 
<bqverse 15>15 if the wicked returns a pledge, pays back what he has stolen, and walks in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity--he will certainly live, he will not die. 
<bqverse 16>16 None of his sins which he has committed will be remembered against him; he has done justice and righteousness, he will certainly live. <p>

<bqverse 17>17 "Yet the sons of your people say, `The conduct of the Lord is not just,'<a name="fnB568" href="eze_note.htm#fn568"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> when it is their conduct that is not just. 
<bqverse 18>18 When the righteous turn from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he will die for it. 
<bqverse 19>19 When the wicked turns from his wickedness and practices justice and righteousness, he will live by them. 
<bqverse 20>20 Yet you say, `The conduct of the Lord is not just.' O house of Israel, I will judge each of you according to his conduct."<a name="_Toc494012839"></a></p>
<p><i>The Fall of Jerusalem</i>

<bqverse 21>21 In the twelfth month of our exile, in the tenth month, on the fifth of the month,<a name="fnB569" href="eze_note.htm#fn569"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> an escapee came to me from Jerusalem saying, "The city has been taken!"<a name="fnB570" href="eze_note.htm#fn570"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22 Now the hand of the LORD was on me<a name="fnB571" href="eze_note.htm#fn571"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> in the evening before the escapee came, but the LORD<a name="fnB572" href="eze_note.htm#fn572"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> opened my mouth by the time the escapee came to me in the morning; so he opened my mouth and I was no longer unable to speak.<a name="fnB573" href="eze_note.htm#fn573"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23 The word of the LORD came to me: 
<bqverse 24>24 "Son of man, the ones living in these waste places in the land of Israel are saying, `Abraham was only one man, yet he possessed the land; but we are many; surely the land has been given to us for a possession.'<a name="fnB574" href="eze_note.htm#fn574"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25 Therefore say to them, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: You eat the meat with the blood, petition your idols, and shed blood; will you possess the land?

<bqverse 27>27 "So you must say to them, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: As I live, surely those in the waste places will die by the sword, those in the open field I will give to the wild beasts for food, and those who are in the strongholds and caves will die of pestilence. 
<bqverse 28>28 I will make the land a desolation and a waste, the pride of her power will come to an end, and the mountains of Israel will be so desolate that no one will pass through them. 
<bqverse 29>29 Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I make the land a desolation and a waste because of all the abominable deeds they have committed.'<a name="fnB576" href="eze_note.htm#fn576"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 30>30 "But as for you, son of man, your countrymen<a name="fnB577" href="eze_note.htm#fn577"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> (who are talking with each other about you by the walls, and at the doors of the houses) say to one another, each to his neighbor, `Come and hear the word that comes from the LORD.' 
<bqverse 31>31 They come to you as people come, and they sit in front of you as<a name="fnB578" href="eze_note.htm#fn578"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> my people, and they hear your words, but they do not do them. For they practice the lustful desires expressed by their mouths, but their heart is set on their unjust gain. 
<bqverse 32>32 You are to them like love songs sung by one with a beautiful voice, who plays an instrument well; they hear your words, but they do not do them.<a name="fnB579" href="eze_note.htm#fn579"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>A Prophecy Against False Shepherds</i>
<p><A NAME="34"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>The word of the LORD came to me: 
<bqverse 2>2 "Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds<a name="fnB580" href="eze_note.htm#fn580"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> of Israel; prophesy, and say to them--to the shepherds: `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Woe, shepherds of Israel who have been feeding themselves! Should not shepherds feed the flock? 
<bqverse 3>3 You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the choice animals; but you do not feed the sheep! 
<bqverse 4>4 You have not strengthened the weak, healed the sick, bound up the broken, brought back the strayed, nor sought the lost; but with force and harshness<a name="fnB581" href="eze_note.htm#fn581"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> you have ruled over them. 
<bqverse 5>5 They were scattered because they had no shepherd; and when they were scattered they became food for every wild beast. 
<bqverse 6>6 My sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. My sheep were scattered over all the face of the earth, but there was no one to seek or search for them. <p>

<bqverse 7>7 "`Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD: 
<bqverse 8>8 As I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, because my sheep have become a prey, and have become food for all the wild beasts, since there was no shepherd and my shepherds did not search for my flock, but fed themselves and did not feed my sheep, 
<bqverse 9>9 therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD: 
<bqverse 10>10 This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against the shepherds; and I will demand my sheep from their hand. I will make them stop feeding sheep; the shepherds will not feed themselves anymore. I will deliver my sheep from their mouth, so that they will no longer be food for them. <p>

<bqverse 11>11 "`For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I myself will search for my sheep and seek them out. 
<bqverse 12>12 As a shepherd seeks out his flock when he is among his scattered sheep, so I will seek out my flock. I will deliver them from all the places where they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness.<a name="fnB582" href="eze_note.htm#fn582"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13 I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from foreign countries and bring them to their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the streams and all the inhabited places of the land. 
<bqverse 14>14 In a good pasture I will feed them, and the mountain heights of Israel will be their pasture. There they will lie down in good grazing ground,<a name="fnB583" href="eze_note.htm#fn583"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> and they will feed on rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. 
<bqverse 15>15 I will feed my sheep and I will make them lie down, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
<bqverse 16>16 I will seek the lost and bring back the strayed, I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, but the fat and the strong I will destroy--I will feed them with judgment. <p>

<bqverse 17>17 "`As for you, you flock, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will judge between one sheep and another, between rams and goats. 
<bqverse 18>18 Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, that you must trample the rest of your pastures with your feet? When you drink clean water, must you foul it by trampling the rest of the water with your feet? 
<bqverse 19>19 As for my sheep, they must eat what you trampled with your feet, and drink what you have fouled with your feet! <p>

<bqverse 20>20 "`Therefore, this is what the Sovereign LORD says to them: I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep. 
<bqverse 21>21 Because you push with your side and your shoulder, and thrust your horns at all the weak until you scattered them abroad,<a name="fnB584" href="eze_note.htm#fn584"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22 so I will save my sheep and they will no longer be a prey. I will judge between one sheep and another.

<bqverse 24>24 And I, the LORD, will be their God, and my servant David will be prince over them; I, the LORD, have spoken. <p>

<bqverse 25>25 "`I will make a covenant of peace with them and will rid the land of wild beasts, so that they can live securely<a name="fnB586" href="eze_note.htm#fn586"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> in the wilderness and sleep in the woods.<a name="fnB587" href="eze_note.htm#fn587"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 28>28 They will no longer be prey for the nations and the wild beasts will not devour them; they will live in security and no one will make them afraid.

<bqverse 28>28 Then you will live in the land I gave to your fathers; and you will be my people, and I will be your God. 
<bqverse 29>29 I will save you from all your uncleanness, and I will call for the grain and multiply it; I will not bring a famine on you. 
<bqverse 30>30 I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the produce of the field, so that you will never again suffer the disgrace of famine among the nations. 
<bqverse 31>31 Then you will remember your evil conduct and your deeds which were not good; and you will loathe yourselves on account of your iniquities and your abominable deeds. 
<bqverse 32>32 Let it be known to you that it is not for your sake I am about to act, declares the Sovereign LORD. Be ashamed and disgraced of your conduct, O house of Israel. <p>

<bqverse 33>33 "`This is what the Sovereign LORD says: On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will save the cities and the waste places will be rebuilt. 
<bqverse 34>34 The desolate land will be tilled, instead of being desolate in the sight of every passerby. 
<bqverse 35>35 And they will say, "This desolate land has become like the garden of Eden--the wasted, desolated, and ruined cities are now fortified and inhabited." 
<bqverse 36>36 And the nations which remain from all around you will know that I, the LORD, have built the ruins and replanted what was desolate. I, the LORD, have spoken and I will do it.'<p>

<bqverse 37>37 "This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will let the house of Israel ask this to be done for them too: I will increase their people like a flock.<a name="fnB606" href="eze_note.htm#fn606"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 38>38 As flocks of offerings, as the sheep of Jerusalem during her appointed feasts, so will the desolate cities be filled with flocks of people. Then they will know that I am the LORD."

<p><i>The Valley of Dry Bones</i>
<p><A NAME="37"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>The hand of the LORD was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the LORD and set<a name="fnB607" href="eze_note.htm#fn607"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> me in the midst of the valley, and it was full of bones. 
<bqverse 2>2 He made me cross all around them, and there were very many bones in the valley and they were very dry. 
<bqverse 3>3 And he said to me, "Son of man, will these bones live?" And I said to him, "O, Lord, you know." 
<bqverse 4>4 Then he said to me, "Prophecy over these bones, and tell them: `Dry bones, hear the word of the LORD. 
<bqverse 5>5 This is what the Sovereign LORD says to these bones: I am bringing a spirit into you and you will live. 
<bqverse 6>6 I will put sinews on you and flesh over you and will cover you with skin, and I will place a spirit in you and you will live. Then you will know that I am the LORD.'" <p>

<bqverse 7>7 So I prophesied just as I was commanded. There was a sound when I prophesied, and a rattling, and the bones came together, bone to bone. 
<bqverse 8>8 And I saw on them sinews and flesh, and skin covered over them from above, but the spirit was not in them.<p>

<bqverse 9>9 And he said to me, "Prophesy to the spirit, prophesy, son of man, and say to the spirit: `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Come from the four winds, spirit, and breathe on these corpses<a name="fnB608" href="eze_note.htm#fn608"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> that they will live.'" 
<bqverse 10>10 And I prophesied just as I was commanded, and the spirit came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet, an extremely great army. <p>

<bqverse 11>11 Then he said to me, "Son of man, these bones are all the house of Israel. They say, `Our bones are dry, our hope has perished; we are cut off.' 
<bqverse 12>12 Therefore prophesy, and tell them, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am opening your graves and will raise you from your graves, my people. I will bring you to the land of Israel. 
<bqverse 13>13 Then you will know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves, and raise you from your graves, my people. 
<bqverse 14>14 And I will place my spirit in you and you will live, and I will cause you to rest on your land. Then you will know that I am the LORD--I have spoken and I will act, declares the LORD.'" <p>

<bqverse 15>15 And the word of the LORD came to me: 
<bqverse 16>16 "And you, son of man, take for yourself one branch, and write on it, `To Judah, and to the sons of Israel associated with him'; and take another branch and write on it, `For Joseph, branch of Ephraim and all the house of Israel associated with him'; 
<bqverse 17>17 and join<a name="fnB609" href="eze_note.htm#fn609"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> them as one stick; they will be as one in your hand. 
<bqverse 18>18 And when the sons of your people speak to you,, `Will you not tell us what these things mean?' 
<bqverse 19>19 tell them, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am taking the branch of Joseph which is in the hand of Ephraim and the tribes of Israel and her associates, and I will set the stick of Judah on it and make them into one stick, and they will be one in my hand.'<a name="fnB610" href="eze_note.htm#fn610"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20 And the sticks you write on will be in your hand in front of them. 
<bqverse 21>21 Then tell them, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am taking the people of Israel from among the nations where they have gone. I will gather them from round about and bring them to their land. 
<bqverse 22>22 I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel, and one king will be over them all.

<bqverse 23>23 They will not make themselves unclean with idols, with their detestable things and with all their transgressions. I will save them from all their dwellings in which they sinned. I will purify them, and they will be my people and I will be their God.<p>

<bqverse 24>24 "`And my servant David will be king over them; there will be one shepherd for all of them. They will walk in my judgments and keep my laws and do them. 
<bqverse 25>25 And they will live in the land I gave to my servant Jacob, in which your father lived, and they will live in it, they and their sons and their grandsons forever. David my servant will be prince over them forever. 
<bqverse 26>26 And I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an eternal covenant with them.<a name="fnB612" href="eze_note.htm#fn612"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> I will establish them,<a name="fnB613" href="eze_note.htm#fn613"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> increase their numbers, and place my sanctuary among them forever. 
<bqverse 27>27 My dwelling place will be with them; I will be their God, and they will be my people. 
<bqverse 28>28 Then, when my sanctuary is among them forever, the nations will know that I, the LORD, sanctify Israel.'"<a name="fnB614" href="eze_note.htm#fn614"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 5>5 Persia, Ethiopia, and Put are with them, all of them with shield and helmet;

<bqverse 11>11 You will say, "I will go up against a land of unwalled villages; I will come to those living quietly in safety, all of them living without walls, and without bars and gates, 
<bqverse 12>12 to capture spoil and seize plunder, to turn my hand against the inhabited waste places and against the people gathered from the nations, who are acquiring cattle and goods, who live at the center<a name="fnB621" href="eze_note.htm#fn621"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> of the earth."

<bqverse 21>21 I will call for a sword against him on all my mountains, declares the Sovereign LORD; every man's sword will be against his brother. 
<bqverse 22>22 I will enter into judgment with him with pestilence and bloodshed. I will rain on him and on his troops and on the many peoples who are with him with torrential rains, hailstones, fire, and brimstone.

<bqverse 3>3 When he brought me there, I saw a man whose appearance was like that of bronze, with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand. He was standing in the gateway. 
<bqverse 4>4 The man said to me, "Son of man, see with your eyes and hear with your ears, and set your heart on everything I am showing you, for you have been brought here so that I might show it to you.<a name="fnB637" href="eze_note.htm#fn637"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> Declare all that you see to the house of Israel." <p>

<bqverse 5>5 Now there was a wall all around the outside of the temple.<a name="fnB638" href="eze_note.htm#fn638"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> In the man's hand was a measuring rod ten and a half feet<a name="fnB639" href="eze_note.htm#fn639"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> long; so he measured the thickness of the wall,<a name="fnB640" href="eze_note.htm#fn640"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> ten and a half feet;<a name="fnB641" href="eze_note.htm#fn641"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> and its height, ten and a half feet. 
<bqverse 6>6 Then he brought me to the gate facing east. He climbed its steps and measured the threshold of the gate, ten and a half feet deep; the first threshold, ten and a half feet wide. 
<bqverse 7>7 The alcoves were ten and a half feet long and ten and a half feet wide; and between the alcoves were eight and three-quarter feet;<a name="fnB642" href="eze_note.htm#fn642"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate facing inward was ten and a half feet. 
<bqverse 8>8 Then he measured the porch of the gate facing inward, ten and a half feet. 
<bqverse 9>9 He measured the porch of the gate, fourteen feet;<a name="fnB643" href="eze_note.htm#fn643"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and its jambs, three and a half feet;<a name="fnB644" href="eze_note.htm#fn644"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> and the porch of the gate faced inward.

<bqverse 15>15 From the front of the entrance gate to the porch of the inner gate was eighty-seven and a half feet.<a name="fnB654" href="eze_note.htm#fn654"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16 There were closed windows toward the alcoves and toward their jambs within the gate all around, and likewise for the porches.

<bqverse 17>17 Then he brought me to the outer court; and there were chambers there, and a pavement made for the court all around; thirty chambers faced the pavement. 
<bqverse 18>18 The pavement was beside the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates; this was the lower pavement. 
<bqverse 19>19 Then he measured the width from before the lower gate to the front of the exterior of the interior court, one hundred seventy-five feet<a name="fnB656" href="eze_note.htm#fn656"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a>on the east and on the north. <p>

<bqverse 20>20 He measured the length and width of the gate of the outer court which faces north. 
<bqverse 21>21 Its alcoves, three on each side, and its jambs and porches had the same measurement as the first gate; eighty-seven and a half feet<a name="fnB657" href="eze_note.htm#fn657"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> long and forty-three and three-quarter feet<a name="fnB658" href="eze_note.htm#fn658"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> wide. 
<bqverse 22>22 Its windows, its porches, and its palm trees had the same measurement as the gate which faced east. Seven steps led up to it; and its porch was on the inside. 
<bqverse 23>23 Opposite the gate on the north and the east, was a gate of the inner court; he measured the distance from gate to gate at one hundred seventy-five feet.<a name="fnB659" href="eze_note.htm#fn659"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 24>24 Then he lead me toward the south, and there was a gate on the south; and he measured its jambs and its porches; they had the same dimensions as the others. 
<bqverse 25>25 There were windows all around it and its porches, like the windows of the others;<a name="fnB660" href="eze_note.htm#fn660"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> eighty-seven and a half feet<a name="fnB661" href="eze_note.htm#fn661"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> long and forty-three and three-quarter feet<a name="fnB662" href="eze_note.htm#fn662"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> wide. 
<bqverse 26>26 There were seven steps going up to it; its porches were in front of them. It had palm trees on its jambs, one on either side. 
<bqverse 27>27 The inner court had a gate toward the south; and he measured it from gate to gate toward the south, one hundred seventy-five feet.<a name="fnB663" href="eze_note.htm#fn663"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 28>28 Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate, and he measured the south gate; it had the same dimensions as the others. 
<bqverse 29>29 Its alcoves, its jambs, and its porches had the same dimensions as the others; and there were windows all around it and its porches; its length was eighty-seven and a half feet<a name="fnB664" href="eze_note.htm#fn664"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> and its width forty-three and three-quarter feet.<a name="fnB665" href="eze_note.htm#fn665"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 30>30 There were porches all around, forty-three and three-quarter feet<a name="fnB666" href="eze_note.htm#fn666"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> long and eight and three-quarter feet<a name="fnB667" href="eze_note.htm#fn667"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> wide. 
<bqverse 31>31 Its porches faced the outer court, and palm trees were on its jambs, and its stairway had eight steps. <p>

<bqverse 32>32 Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gate; it had the same dimensions as the others. 
<bqverse 33>33 Its alcoves, its jambs, and its porches had the same dimensions as the others; and there were windows all around it and its porches; its length was eighty-seven and a half feet<a name="fnB668" href="eze_note.htm#fn668"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> and its width forty-three and three-quarter feet.<a name="fnB669" href="eze_note.htm#fn669"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 34>34 Its porches faced the outer court, it had palm trees on its jambs, and its stairway had eight steps. <p>

<bqverse 35>35 Then he brought me to the north gate, and he measured it; it had the same dimensions as the others-- 
<bqverse 36>36 its alcoves, its jambs, and its porches. And it had windows all around it; its length was eighty-seven and a half feet<a name="fnB670" href="eze_note.htm#fn670"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> and its width forty-three and three-quarter feet.<a name="fnB671" href="eze_note.htm#fn671"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 37>37 Its jambs<a name="fnB672" href="eze_note.htm#fn672"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> faced the outer court, and it had palm trees on its jambs, on either side; and its stairway had eight steps. <p>

<bqverse 38>38 There was a chamber with its door by the jambs of the gates; there they washed the burnt offering. 
<bqverse 39>39 In the porch of the gate were two tables on either side on which to slaughter the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering. 
<bqverse 40>40 On the outside of the porch as one goes up at the entrance of the north gate were two tables; and on the other side of the porch of the gate were two tables. 
<bqverse 41>41 Four tables were on each side of the gate, eight tables on which the sacrifices were to be slaughtered. 
<bqverse 42>42 There were also four tables of carved stone for the burnt offering, two and two-thirds feet<a name="fnB673" href="eze_note.htm#fn673"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> long, two and two-thirds feet<a name="fnB674" href="eze_note.htm#fn674"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> wide, and one and three-quarter feet<a name="fnB675" href="eze_note.htm#fn675"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> high, on which they placed the instruments used to slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice. 
<bqverse 43>43 There were hooks<a name="fnB676" href="eze_note.htm#fn676"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> three inches<a name="fnB677" href="eze_note.htm#fn677"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> long, fastened in the house all around. And on the tables was the flesh of the offering. <p>

<bqverse 44>44 On the outside of the inner gate were chambers for the singers of the inner court, one<a name="fnB678" href="eze_note.htm#fn678"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> at the side of the north gate facing south, and the other at the side of the east gate facing north. 
<bqverse 45>45 He said to me, "This chamber which faces south is for the priests who keep charge of the temple, 
<bqverse 46>46 and the chamber which faces north is for the priests who keep charge of the altar; these are the sons of Zadok, from the sons of Levi, who may approach the LORD to minister to him." 
<bqverse 47>47 He measured the court, one hundred seventy-five feet long and one hundred seventy-five feet wide,<a name="fnB679" href="eze_note.htm#fn679"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> a square; and the altar was in front of the temple. <p>

<bqverse 48>48 Then he brought me to the porch of the temple and measured the jambs of the porch, eight and three-quarter feet<a name="fnB680" href="eze_note.htm#fn680"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> on either side; and the width of the gate was five and a quarter feet<a name="fnB681" href="eze_note.htm#fn681"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> on each side. 
<bqverse 49>49 The length of the porch was thirty-five feet<a name="fnB682" href="eze_note.htm#fn682"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> and the width nineteen and a quarter feet<a name="fnB683" href="eze_note.htm#fn683"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a>, and steps<a name="fnB684" href="eze_note.htm#fn684"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> led up to it; there were pillars beside the jambs on either side.

<p><i>The Inner Temple</i>
<p><A NAME="41"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>Then he brought me to the outer sanctuary, and measured the jambs; the width of the jambs was ten and a half feet<a name="fnB685" href="eze_note.htm#fn685"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> wide on each side. 
<bqverse 2>2 The width of the entrance was seventeen and a half feet,<a name="fnB686" href="eze_note.htm#fn686"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> and the sides of the entrance were eight and three-quarter feet<a name="fnB687" href="eze_note.htm#fn687"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> on each side. He measured the length of the outer sanctuary, seventy feet,<a name="fnB688" href="eze_note.htm#fn688"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> and its width, thirty-five feet.<a name="fnB689" href="eze_note.htm#fn689"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 3>3 Then he went into the inner sanctuary and measured the jambs of the entrance, three and a half feet;<a name="fnB690" href="eze_note.htm#fn690"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> and the entrance, ten and a half feet;<a name="fnB691" href="eze_note.htm#fn691"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> and the width of the entrance, twelve and a quarter feet<a name="fnB692" href="eze_note.htm#fn692"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4 Then he measured its length, thirty-five feet,<a name="fnB693" href="eze_note.htm#fn693"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> and its width, thirty-five feet,<a name="fnB694" href="eze_note.htm#fn694"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> before the outer sanctuary. And he said to me, "This is the most holy place." <p>

<bqverse 5>5 Then he measured the wall of the temple,<a name="fnB695" href="eze_note.htm#fn695"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> ten and a half feet;<a name="fnB696" href="eze_note.htm#fn696"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> and the width of the side chambers, seven feet,<a name="fnB697" href="eze_note.htm#fn697"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> all around the temple. 
<bqverse 6>6 The side chambers were in three stories, one above the other, thirty in each story. There were offsets in the wall all around to serve as supports for the side chambers, so that the supports were not in the wall of the temple. 
<bqverse 7>7 The side chambers surrounding the temple were wider at each successive story; for the structure<a name="fnB698" href="eze_note.htm#fn698"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> surrounding the temple went up story by story all around the temple. For this reason the width of the temple increased as it went up; and thus one went up from the lowest story to the highest by the way of the middle story. <p>

<bqverse 8>8 I saw that the temple had a raised platform all around; the foundations of the side chambers were a full measuring rod<a name="fnB699" href="eze_note.htm#fn699"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> of ten and a half feet<a name="fnB700" href="eze_note.htm#fn700"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> high. 
<bqverse 9>9 The width of the outer wall of the side chambers was eight and three-quarter feet,<a name="fnB701" href="eze_note.htm#fn701"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> and the open area between the side chambers of the temple 
<bqverse 10>10 and the chambers of the court was thirty-five feet<a name="fnB702" href="eze_note.htm#fn702"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> in width all around the temple on every side. 
<bqverse 11>11 There were entrances of the side chambers toward the open area, one entrance toward the north, and another entrance toward the south; and the width of the open area was eight and three-quarter feet<a name="fnB703" href="eze_note.htm#fn703"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> all around. <p>

<bqverse 12>12 The building that was facing the temple courtyard at the west side was one hundred twenty-two and a half feet<a name="fnB704" href="eze_note.htm#fn704"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> wide; and the wall of the building was eight and three-quarter feet<a name="fnB705" href="eze_note.htm#fn705"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> all around, and its length one hundred fifty-seven and a half feet.<a name="fnB706" href="eze_note.htm#fn706"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 13>13 Then he measured the temple, one hundred seventy-five feet<a name="fnB707" href="eze_note.htm#fn707"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> long; and the courtyard of the temple and the building and its walls, one hundred seventy-five feet<a name="fnB708" href="eze_note.htm#fn708"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> long; 
<bqverse 14>14 also the width of the front of the temple and the courtyard on the east, one hundred seventy-five feet.<a name="fnB709" href="eze_note.htm#fn709"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 15>15 Then he measured the length of the building facing the courtyard at the rear of the temple, with its galleries on either side, one hundred seventy-five feet.<a name="fnB710" href="eze_note.htm#fn710"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> <p>
The outer sanctuary of the temple and the inner room and the porch of the court<a name="fnB711" href="eze_note.htm#fn711"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> were paneled<a name="fnB712" href="eze_note.htm#fn712"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16 as well as the thresholds and narrow windows and galleries all around the three of them--facing the threshold of the temple everything was paneled with wood all around, from the ground up to the windows (now the windows were covered), 
<bqverse 17>17 to the space above the entrance, until the inner room, and on the outside, and on all the walls in the inner room and outside, by measurement. 
<bqverse 18>18 It was made with cherubim and palm trees, a palm tree between each cherub. Each cherub had two faces: 
<bqverse 19>19 a human face toward the palm tree on one side and a lion's face toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved on the whole temple all around; 
<bqverse 20>20 from the ground to the area above the entrance, cherubim and palm trees carved on the wall of the outer sanctuary. 
<bqverse 21>21 The doorposts of the outer sanctuary were square. In front of the sanctuary one doorpost looked just like the other. 
<bqverse 22>22 The altar was of wood, five and a quarter feet<a name="fnB713" href="eze_note.htm#fn713"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> high, and its length three and a half feet;<a name="fnB714" href="eze_note.htm#fn714"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> its corners, its length,<a name="fnB715" href="eze_note.htm#fn715"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> and its walls were of wood. And he said to me, "This is the table that is before the LORD." 
<bqverse 23>23 The outer sanctuary and the inner sanctuary each had a double door. 
<bqverse 24>24 Each of the doors had two leaves, two swinging<a name="fnB716" href="eze_note.htm#fn716"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> leaves; two leaves for one door and two leaves for the other. 
<bqverse 25>25 On the doors of the outer sanctuary were carved cherubim and palm trees, like those carved on the walls; and there was a canopy of wood on the front of the outside porch. 
<bqverse 26>26 And there were narrow windows and palm trees on either side of the side walls of the porch; this is what the side chambers of the temple and the canopies were like.

<a name="_Toc494012847"></a></p>
<p><i>Chambers for the Temple</i>
<p><A NAME="42"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>Then he led me out to the outer court, toward the north, and brought me to the chamber which was opposite the open area and opposite the building on the north. 
<bqverse 2>2 Its length was one hundred seventy-five feet<a name="fnB717" href="eze_note.htm#fn717"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> on the north side,<a name="fnB718" href="eze_note.htm#fn718"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> and its width eighty-seven and a half feet.<a name="fnB719" href="eze_note.htm#fn719"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3 Opposite the thirty-five feet<a name="fnB720" href="eze_note.htm#fn720"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> that belonged to the inner court, and opposite the pavement which belonged to the outer court, gallery faced gallery in the three stories. 
<bqverse 4>4 In front of the chambers was a walkway on the inner side, seventeen and a half feet<a name="fnB721" href="eze_note.htm#fn721"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> wide at a distance of one and three-quarter feet,<a name="fnB722" href="eze_note.htm#fn722"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> and their entrances were on the north. 
<bqverse 5>5 Now the upper chambers were narrower, because the galleries took more space from them than from the lower and middle chambers of the building. 
<bqverse 6>6 For they were in three stories and had no pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore the upper chambers<a name="fnB723" href="eze_note.htm#fn723"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> were set back from the ground more than the lower and upper ones. 
<bqverse 7>7 As for the outer wall by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court facing the chambers, it was eighty-seven and a half feet<a name="fnB724" href="eze_note.htm#fn724"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> long. 
<bqverse 8>8 For the chambers on the outer court were eighty-seven and a half feet<a name="fnB725" href="eze_note.htm#fn725"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> long, while those facing the temple were one hundred seventy-five feet<a name="fnB726" href="eze_note.htm#fn726"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> long. 
<bqverse 9>9 Below these chambers was a passage on the east side as one enters from the outer court. <p>

<bqverse 10>10 In the width of the wall of the court toward the east, facing the open area and facing the building were chambers 
<bqverse 11>11 with a passage in front of them; they looked like the chambers on the north, of the same length and width, and all their exits according to their arrangements and entrances. 
<bqverse 12>12 So the entrances to the chambers which were toward the south had an opening at the head of the passage, the passage in front of the corresponding wall toward the east when one enters. <p>

<bqverse 13>13 Then he said to me, "The north chambers and the south chambers which face the open area are holy chambers where the priests<a name="fnB727" href="eze_note.htm#fn727"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> who approach the LORD will eat the most holy offerings; there they will place the most holy offerings--the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering, because the place is holy. 
<bqverse 14>14 When the priests enter, then they will not go out from the sanctuary to the outer court without taking off their garments in which they minister, for these are holy; they will put on other garments, then they will go near the places where the people are."<p>

<bqverse 15>15 Now when he had finished measuring the interior of the temple, he led me out by the gate which faces east and measured all around. 
<bqverse 16>16 He measured the east side with a measuring rod,<a name="fnB728" href="eze_note.htm#fn728"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> eight hundred seventy-five feet<a name="fnB729" href="eze_note.htm#fn729"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> by the measuring rod. 
<bqverse 17>17 He measured the north side, eight hundred seventy-five feet<a name="fnB730" href="eze_note.htm#fn730"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> by the measuring rod. 
<bqverse 18>18 He measured the south side, eight hundred seventy-five feet<a name="fnB731" href="eze_note.htm#fn731"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> by the measuring rod. 
<bqverse 19>19 He turned to the west side and measured eight hundred seventy-five feet<a name="fnB732" href="eze_note.htm#fn732"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> by the measuring rod. 
<bqverse 20>20 He measured it on all four sides. It had a wall around it, eight hundred seventy-five feet<a name="fnB733" href="eze_note.htm#fn733"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> long and eight hundred seventy-five feet<a name="fnB734" href="eze_note.htm#fn734"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> wide, to separate between the holy and common places.

<p><i>The Glory Returns to the Temple</i>
<p><A NAME="43"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>Then he brought me to the gate that faced toward the east. 
<bqverse 2>2 And there, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east;<a name="fnB735" href="eze_note.htm#fn735"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> the sound was like the sound of many waters;<a name="fnB736" href="eze_note.htm#fn736"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> and the earth shone with his glory. 
<bqverse 3>3 And it was like the vision I had seen, like the appearance I saw when he<a name="fnB737" href="eze_note.htm#fn737"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> came to destroy the city, and the vision I saw by the river Kebar; and I threw myself down with my face to the ground. 
<bqverse 4>4 And the glory of the LORD came into the temple by the way of the gate that faces east. 
<bqverse 5>5 And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the inner court; and the glory of the LORD filled the temple.<a name="fnB738" href="eze_note.htm#fn738"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 6>6 Then I heard one speaking to me from the temple, while the man was standing beside me. 
<bqverse 7>7 He said to me: "Son of man, this is the place of my throne<a name="fnB739" href="eze_note.htm#fn739"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and the place for the soles of my feet,<a name="fnB740" href="eze_note.htm#fn740"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> where I will live among the people of Israel forever.

<bqverse 8>8 When they placed their threshold by my threshold and their doorposts by my doorposts, with only the wall between me and them, they defiled my holy name by their abominable deeds they committed. So I consumed them in my anger. 
<bqverse 9>9 Now let them put away their spiritual prostitution and the corpses of their kings from me, and I will live among them forever. <p>

<bqverse 10>10 "As for you, son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel, so that they may be ashamed of their abominable practices; and let them measure the pattern. 
<bqverse 11>11 When they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the plan of the temple, its arrangement, its exits and entrances, and its whole plan--all its statutes and its entire plan and all its laws; write it down in their sight, so that they will observe its entire plan and carry out all its statutes. <p>

<bqverse 12>12 "This is the law of the temple: the entire area on top of the mountain all around will be most holy. This is the law of the temple. <a name="_Toc494012849"></a></p>

Then he led me and brought me back to the bank of the river. 
<bqverse 7>7 When I had returned, on the banks of the river, on both sides, there stood a vast number of trees. 
<bqverse 8>8 He said to me, "These waters go out toward the eastern region and go down into the Arabah; and when they enter the sea, going out to the sea, the waters become fresh.<a name="fnB808" href="eze_note.htm#fn808"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9 Every living creature which swarms where the river<a name="fnB809" href="eze_note.htm#fn809"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> goes will live, and there will be very many fish, for these waters go there. It will become fresh and everything will live where the river goes. 
<bqverse 10>10 Fishermen will stand beside it; from Engedi to Eneglaim there will be a place for spreading nets; their fish will be of a great many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea.<a name="fnB810" href="eze_note.htm#fn810"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  But its swamps and its marshes will not become fresh; they are to be left for salt. 
<bqverse 12>12 On both sides of the river's banks, every kind of tree will grow for food. Their leaves will not wither nor will their fruit fail, but they will bear fruit every month, because their water flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food and their leaves for healing."<a name="fnB811" href="eze_note.htm#fn811"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> <a name="_Toc494012855"></a></p>
<p><i>Boundaries for the Land </i>
<p>
<bqverse 13>13 This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "This will be the boundary you will use to divide the land for the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph will have two portions.<a name="fnB812" href="eze_note.htm#fn812"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14 You must divide it equally as I swore to give it to your forefathers,<a name="fnB813" href="eze_note.htm#fn813"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> and this land will fall to you as an inheritance. <p>

<bqverse 15>15 "This will be the boundary of the land:<a name="fnB814" href="eze_note.htm#fn814"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> On the north side, from the Great Sea by way of Hethlon to the entrance of Zedad; 
<bqverse 16>16 Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath, as far as Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran. 
<bqverse 17>17 The boundary will run from the sea to Hazar-enan, at the border of Damascus, and on the north toward the north is the border of Hamath. This is the north side. 
<bqverse 18>18 On the east side, between Hauran and Damascus, and between Gilead and the land of Israel, will be the Jordan; you will measure from the border to the eastern sea. This is the east side. 
<bqverse 19>19 On the south side toward the south, it will run from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, from the wadi to the Great Sea. This is the south side. 
<bqverse 20>20 On the west side, the Great Sea will be the boundary to a point opposite Lebo-hamath. This is the west side. <p>

<bqverse 21>21 "This is how you will divide this land among you for the tribes of Israel. 
<bqverse 22>22 You must divide it by lot as an inheritance among yourselves and for the foreigners who reside among you, who have fathered sons among you. You must treat them as native-born among the people of Israel; they will be allotted an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.<a name="fnB815" href="eze_note.htm#fn815"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23 In whatever tribe the foreigner resides with you, there you will give him his inheritance," declares the Sovereign LORD.

<bqverse 11>11 This will be for the priests who are sanctified from the sons of Zadok who kept my charge, who did not go astray when the people of Israel went astray, like the Levites did. 
<bqverse 12>12 It will be for them an allotment from the allotment of the land, a most holy place, adjoining the border of the Levites. <p>

<bqverse 13>13 "Alongside the border of the priests, the Levites will have an allotment eight and a quarter miles<a name="fnB825" href="eze_note.htm#fn825"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> in length and three and one-third miles<a name="fnB826" href="eze_note.htm#fn826"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> in width.

<bqverse 21>21 "The rest, on both sides of the holy allotment and the possession of the city, will belong to the prince.
