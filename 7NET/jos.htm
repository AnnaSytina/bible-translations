<p><A NAME="1"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> After Moses the LORD's servant died, the LORD said to Joshua son of Nun, Moses' assistant: 
<bqverse 2>2  "Moses my servant is dead. Get ready!<a name="fnB0" href="jos_note.htm#fn0"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> Cross the Jordan River!

<bqverse 3>3  I am handing over to you every place you set foot, as I promised Moses.<a name="fnB2" href="jos_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  Your territory will extend from the wilderness in the south to Lebanon in the north. It will extend all the way to the great River Euphrates in the east (including all of Syria)<a name="fnB3" href="jos_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> and all the way to the Mediterranean Sea<a name="fnB4" href="jos_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> in the west.<a name="fnB5" href="jos_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  No one will be able to resist you<a name="fnB6" href="jos_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not abandon you or leave you alone. 
<bqverse 6>6  Be strong and brave! You must lead these people in the conquest of this land that I solemnly promised their ancestors I would hand over to them.<a name="fnB7" href="jos_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  Make sure you are<a name="fnB8" href="jos_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> very strong and brave! Carefully obey<a name="fnB9" href="jos_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> all the law my servant Moses charged you to keep!<a name="fnB10" href="jos_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> Do not swerve from it to the right or the left, so you may be successful<a name="fnB11" href="jos_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> in all you do.<a name="fnB12" href="jos_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  This law scroll must not leave your lips!<a name="fnB13" href="jos_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> You must memorize it<a name="fnB14" href="jos_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> day and night so you can carefully obey<a name="fnB15" href="jos_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> all that is written in it.

<p><i>Joshua Prepares for the Invasion</i>
<p>
<bqverse 10>10  Joshua instructed<a name="fnB21" href="jos_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> the leaders of the people: 
<bqverse 11>11  "Go through the camp and command the people, `Prepare your supplies, for within three days you will cross the Jordan River<a name="fnB22" href="jos_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> and begin the conquest of the land the LORD your God is ready to hand over to you.'"<a name="fnB23" href="jos_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 12>12  Joshua told the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh: 
<bqverse 13>13  "Remember what Moses the LORD's servant commanded you.<a name="fnB24" href="jos_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> The LORD your God is giving you a place to settle and is handing this land over to you.<a name="fnB25" href="jos_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  Your wives, children and cattle may stay in the land that Moses assigned to you east of the Jordan River. But all you warriors must cross over armed for battle ahead of your brothers.<a name="fnB26" href="jos_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> You must help them 
<bqverse 15>15  until the LORD gives your brothers a place like yours to settle and they conquer the land the LORD your God is ready to hand over to them. Then you may go back to your allotted land and occupy the land Moses the LORD's servant assigned you east of the Jordan."<a name="fnB27" href="jos_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 16>16  They told Joshua, "We will do everything you say. We will go wherever you send us. 
<bqverse 17>17  Just as we obeyed<a name="fnB28" href="jos_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> Moses, so we will obey you. But<a name="fnB29" href="jos_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> may the LORD your God be with you as he was with Moses. 
<bqverse 18>18  Any man who rebels against what you say and does not obey all your commands will be executed.<a name="fnB30" href="jos_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> But<a name="fnB31" href="jos_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> be strong and brave!"

<p><i>Joshua Sends Spies into the Land</i>
<p><A NAME="2"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Joshua son of Nun sent two spies out from Shittim and instructed them:<a name="fnB32" href="jos_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> "Find out what you can about the land, especially Jericho."<a name="fnB33" href="jos_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> They stopped at the house of a prostitute named Rahab and spent the night there.<a name="fnB34" href="jos_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  The king of Jericho received this report: "Note well!<a name="fnB35" href="jos_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> Israelite men have come here tonight<a name="fnB36" href="jos_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> to spy on the land." 
<bqverse 3>3  So the king of Jericho sent this order to Rahab:<a name="fnB37" href="jos_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> "Turn over<a name="fnB38" href="jos_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> the men who came to you<a name="fnB39" href="jos_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a>--the ones who came to your house<a name="fnB40" href="jos_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a>--for they have come to spy on the whole land!" 
<bqverse 4>4  But the woman hid the two men<a name="fnB41" href="jos_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and replied, "Yes, these men were clients of mine,<a name="fnB42" href="jos_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> but I didn't know where they came from. 
<bqverse 5>5  When it was time to shut the city gate for the night, the men left.<a name="fnB43" href="jos_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> I don't know where they were heading. Chase after them quickly, for you have time to catch them!" 
<bqverse 6>6  (Now she had taken them up to the roof and had hidden them in the stalks of flax she had spread out<a name="fnB44" href="jos_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> on the roof.) 
<bqverse 7>7  Meanwhile<a name="fnB45" href="jos_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> the king's men tried to find them on the road to the Jordan River<a name="fnB46" href="jos_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> near the fords.<a name="fnB47" href="jos_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> The city gate was shut as soon as they set out in pursuit of them.<a name="fnB48" href="jos_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 8>8  Now before the spies<a name="fnB49" href="jos_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> went to sleep, Rahab<a name="fnB50" href="jos_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> went up<a name="fnB51" href="jos_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> to the roof. 
<bqverse 9>9  She said to the men, "I know the LORD is handing this land over to you.<a name="fnB52" href="jos_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> We are absolutely terrified of you,<a name="fnB53" href="jos_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> and all who live in the land are cringing before<a name="fnB54" href="jos_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> you.<a name="fnB55" href="jos_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  For we heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you left Egypt and how you annihilated the two Amorite kings, Sihon and Og, on the other side of the Jordan.<a name="fnB56" href="jos_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11 When we heard the news we lost our strength and no one could even breathe for fear of you.<a name="fnB57" href="jos_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> For the LORD your God is God in heaven above and on earth below! 
<bqverse 12>12  So now, promise me this with an oath sworn in the LORD's name.<a name="fnB58" href="jos_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> Because I have shown allegiance to you, show allegiance to my family.<a name="fnB59" href="jos_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> Give me a solemn pledge<a name="fnB60" href="jos_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  that you will spare the lives of my father, mother, brothers, sisters, and all who belong to them, and rescue us<a name="fnB61" href="jos_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> from death." 
<bqverse 14>14  The men said to her, "If you<a name="fnB62" href="jos_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> die, may we die too!"<a name="fnB63" href="jos_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> If you do not report what we've been up to,<a name="fnB64" href="jos_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> then, when the LORD hands the land over to us, we will show unswerving allegiance<a name="fnB65" href="jos_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> to you."<sup><sub> </sub></sup><a name="fnB66" href="jos_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 15>15  Then Rahab<a name="fnB67" href="jos_note.htm#fn67"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> let them down by a rope<a name="fnB68" href="jos_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> through the window. (Her<a name="fnB69" href="jos_note.htm#fn69"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> house was built as part of the city wall; she lived in the wall.)<a name="fnB70" href="jos_note.htm#fn70"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  She told them, "Head<a name="fnB71" href="jos_note.htm#fn71"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> to the hill country, so the ones chasing you don't find you.<a name="fnB72" href="jos_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> Hide from them there for three days, long enough for those chasing you<a name="fnB73" href="jos_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> to return. Then you can be on your way." 
<bqverse 17>17  The men said to her, "We are not bound by this oath you made us swear unless the following conditions are met:<a name="fnB74" href="jos_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  When we invade the land<a name="fnB75" href="jos_note.htm#fn75"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a>, tie this red rope<a name="fnB76" href="jos_note.htm#fn76"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> in the window through which you let us down, and gather together in your house your father, mother, brothers, and all who live in your father's house.<a name="fnB77" href="jos_note.htm#fn77"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  Anyone who leaves your house will be responsible for his own death--we are innocent in that case!<a name="fnB78" href="jos_note.htm#fn78"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> But if anyone with you in the house is harmed, we will be responsible.<a name="fnB79" href="jos_note.htm#fn79"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  If you should report what we've been up to,<a name="fnB80" href="jos_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> we are not bound by this oath you made us swear." 
<bqverse 21>21  She said, "I agree to these conditions."<a name="fnB81" href="jos_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> She sent them on their way<a name="fnB82" href="jos_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> and then tied the red rope in the window. 
<bqverse 22>22  They went<a name="fnB83" href="jos_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> to the hill country and stayed there for three days, long enough for those chasing them<a name="fnB84" href="jos_note.htm#fn84"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> to return. Their pursuers<a name="fnB85" href="jos_note.htm#fn85"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> looked all along the way but did not find them.<a name="fnB86" href="jos_note.htm#fn86"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23  Then the two men returned--they came down from the hills, crossed the river,<a name="fnB87" href="jos_note.htm#fn87"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> came to Joshua son of Nun, and reported to him all they had discovered. 
<bqverse 24>24  They told Joshua, "Surely the LORD is handing over all the land to us!<a name="fnB88" href="jos_note.htm#fn88"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> All who live in the land are cringing before us!"<a name="fnB89" href="jos_note.htm#fn89"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqchapter 3>
<a name="_Toc494011782"></a></p>
<p><i>Israel Crosses the Jordan</i>
<p><A NAME="3"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Bright and early the next morning Joshua and the Israelites left Shittim and came to the Jordan.<a name="fnB90" href="jos_note.htm#fn90"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> They camped there before crossing the river.<a name="fnB91" href="jos_note.htm#fn91"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  After three days the leaders went through the camp 
<bqverse 3>3  and commanded the people: "When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God<a name="fnB92" href="jos_note.htm#fn92"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> being carried by the levitical priests, you must leave here<a name="fnB93" href="jos_note.htm#fn93"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> and walk<a name="fnB94" href="jos_note.htm#fn94"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> behind it. 
<bqverse 4>4  But stay about three thousand feet behind it.<a name="fnB95" href="jos_note.htm#fn95"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> Keep your distance<a name="fnB96" href="jos_note.htm#fn96"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> so you can see<a name="fnB97" href="jos_note.htm#fn97"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> which way you should go, for you have not traveled this way before."<p>

<bqverse 5>5  Joshua told the people, "Ritually consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will perform miraculous deeds among you." 
<bqverse 6>6  Joshua told the priests, "Pick up the ark of the covenant and pass on ahead of the people." So they picked up the ark of the covenant and went ahead of the people.<p>

<bqverse 7>7  The LORD told Joshua, "This very day I will begin to honor you before all Israel<a name="fnB98" href="jos_note.htm#fn98"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> so they will know that I am with you just as I was with Moses. 
<bqverse 8>8  Instruct the priests carrying the ark of the covenant, `When you reach the bank of the Jordan River,<a name="fnB99" href="jos_note.htm#fn99"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> wade into the water.'"<a name="fnB100" href="jos_note.htm#fn100"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 9>9  Joshua told the Israelites, "Come here and listen to the words of the LORD your God!" 
<bqverse 10>10  Joshua continued,<a name="fnB101" href="jos_note.htm#fn101"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> "This is how you will know the living God is among you and that he will truly drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites. 
<bqverse 11>11  Look! The ark of the covenant of the Ruler<a name="fnB102" href="jos_note.htm#fn102"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> of the whole earth is ready to enter the Jordan ahead of you. 
<bqverse 12>12  Now select for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one per tribe. 
<bqverse 13>13  When the feet<a name="fnB103" href="jos_note.htm#fn103"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> of the priests carrying the ark of the LORD, the Ruler<a name="fnB104" href="jos_note.htm#fn104"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> of the whole earth, touch<a name="fnB105" href="jos_note.htm#fn105"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> the water of the Jordan, the water coming downstream toward you will stop flowing and pile up."<a name="fnB106" href="jos_note.htm#fn106"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 14>14  So when the people left their tents to cross the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went<a name="fnB107" href="jos_note.htm#fn107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> ahead of them. 
<bqverse 15>15  When the ones carrying the ark reached the Jordan and the feet of the priests carrying the ark touched the surface<a name="fnB108" href="jos_note.htm#fn108"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> of the water--(the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest time)<a name="fnB109" href="jos_note.htm#fn109"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a>-- 
<bqverse 16>16  the water coming downstream toward them stopped flowing.<a name="fnB110" href="jos_note.htm#fn110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> It piled up far upstream<a name="fnB111" href="jos_note.htm#fn111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> at Adam (the city near Zarethan); there was no water at all flowing to the sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea).<a name="fnB112" href="jos_note.htm#fn112"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> The people crossed the river opposite Jericho. 
<bqverse 17>17  The priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firmly on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan. All Israel crossed over on dry ground until the entire nation was on the other side.<a name="fnB113" href="jos_note.htm#fn113"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqchapter 4>
<a name="_Toc494011783"></a></p>
<p><i>Israel Commemorates the Crossing</i>
<p><A NAME="4"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> When the entire nation was on the other side,<a name="fnB114" href="jos_note.htm#fn114"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD told Joshua, 
<bqverse 2>2  "Select for yourselves twelve men from the people, one per tribe. 
<bqverse 3>3  Instruct them, `Pick up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, from the very place where the priests<a name="fnB115" href="jos_note.htm#fn115"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> stand firmly, and carry them over with you and put them in the place where you camp tonight.'"<p>

<bqverse 4>4  Joshua summoned the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites, one per tribe. 
<bqverse 5>5  Joshua told them, "Go in front of the ark of the LORD your God to the middle of the Jordan. Each of you is to put a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the Israelite tribes. 
<bqverse 6>6  The stones<a name="fnB116" href="jos_note.htm#fn116"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> will be a reminder to you.<a name="fnB117" href="jos_note.htm#fn117"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> When your children ask someday, `Why are these stones important to you?' 
<bqverse 7>7  tell them how the water of the Jordan stopped flowing<a name="fnB118" href="jos_note.htm#fn118"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> before the ark of the covenant of the LORD. When it crossed the Jordan, the water of the Jordan stopped flowing.<a name="fnB119" href="jos_note.htm#fn119"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> These stones will be a lasting memorial for the Israelites."<p>

<bqverse 8>8  The Israelites did just as Joshua commanded. They picked up twelve stones, according to the number of the Israelite tribes, from the middle of the Jordan as the LORD had instructed Joshua. They carried them over with them to the camp and put them there. 
<bqverse 9>9  Joshua set up twelve stones<a name="fnB120" href="jos_note.htm#fn120"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a><sup><sub> </sub></sup>in the middle of the Jordan in the very place where the priests carrying the ark of the covenant stood. They remain there to this very day.<p>

<bqverse 10>10  Now the priests carrying the ark of the covenant were standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything the Lord had commanded Joshua to tell the people was accomplished, in accordance with all that Moses had commanded Joshua. The people went across quickly, 
<bqverse 11>11  and when all the people had finished crossing, the ark of the LORD and the priests crossed as the people looked on.<a name="fnB121" href="jos_note.htm#fn121"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  The Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed for battle ahead of the Israelites, just as Moses had instructed them. 
<bqverse 13>13  About forty thousand battle-ready troops<a name="fnB122" href="jos_note.htm#fn122"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> marched past the LORD to fight<a name="fnB123" href="jos_note.htm#fn123"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> on the plains of Jericho. 
<bqverse 14>14  That day the LORD brought honor to Joshua before all Israel. They respected<a name="fnB124" href="jos_note.htm#fn124"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> him his whole lifetime,<a name="fnB125" href="jos_note.htm#fn125"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> just as they had respected<a name="fnB126" href="jos_note.htm#fn126"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> Moses.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  The LORD told Joshua, 
<bqverse 16>16  "Instruct the priests carrying the ark of the covenantal laws<a name="fnB127" href="jos_note.htm#fn127"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> to come up from the Jordan." 
<bqverse 17>17  So Joshua instructed the priests, "Come up from the Jordan!" 
<bqverse 18>18  The priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD came up from the middle of the Jordan, and as soon as they set foot on dry land,<a name="fnB128" href="jos_note.htm#fn128"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> the water of the Jordan flowed again and returned to flood stage.<a name="fnB129" href="jos_note.htm#fn129"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 19>19  The people went up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month<a name="fnB130" href="jos_note.htm#fn130"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> and camped in Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho. 
<bqverse 20>20  Now Joshua set up in Gilgal the<a name="fnB131" href="jos_note.htm#fn131"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> twelve stones they had taken from the Jordan. 
<bqverse 21>21  He told the Israelites, "When your children someday ask their fathers, `What do these stones represent?'<a name="fnB132" href="jos_note.htm#fn132"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 23>23  For the LORD your God dried up the water of the Jordan before you while you crossed over. It was just like when the LORD your God dried up the Red Sea before us while we crossed it.<a name="fnB135" href="jos_note.htm#fn135"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  He has done this so<a name="fnB136" href="jos_note.htm#fn136"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> all the nations<a name="fnB137" href="jos_note.htm#fn137"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> of the earth might recognize the LORD's power<a name="fnB138" href="jos_note.htm#fn138"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> and so you might always obey<a name="fnB139" href="jos_note.htm#fn139"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD your God."<p>

<bqchapter 5><A NAME="5"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> When all the Amorite kings on the west side of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the seacoast heard how the LORD had dried up the water of the Jordan before the Israelites while they<a name="fnB140" href="jos_note.htm#fn140"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> crossed, they lost their strength and could not even breathe for fear of the Israelites.<a name="fnB141" href="jos_note.htm#fn141"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> <a name="_Toc494011784"></a></p>
<p><i>A New Generation is Circumcised </i>
<p>
<bqverse 2>2  At that time the LORD told Joshua, "Make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites once again."<a name="fnB142" href="jos_note.htm#fn142"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites on the Hill of the Foreskins.<a name="fnB143" href="jos_note.htm#fn143"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  This is why Joshua had to circumcise them: All the men old enough to fight when they left Egypt died on the journey through the desert after they left Egypt.<a name="fnB144" href="jos_note.htm#fn144"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  Now<a name="fnB145" href="jos_note.htm#fn145"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> all the men<a name="fnB146" href="jos_note.htm#fn146"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> who left were circumcised, but all the sons<a name="fnB147" href="jos_note.htm#fn147"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> born on the journey through the desert after they left Egypt were uncircumcised. 
<bqverse 6>6  Indeed, for forty years the Israelites traveled through the desert until all the men old enough to fight when they left Egypt, the ones who had disobeyed the LORD, died off.<a name="fnB148" href="jos_note.htm#fn148"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> For the LORD had sworn a solemn oath to them that he would not let them see the land he had sworn on oath to give them,<a name="fnB149" href="jos_note.htm#fn149"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> a land rich in<a name="fnB150" href="jos_note.htm#fn150"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> milk and honey. 
<bqverse 7>7  He replaced them with their sons,<a name="fnB151" href="jos_note.htm#fn151"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> whom Joshua circumcised. They were uncircumcised; their fathers had not circumcised them along the way. 
<bqverse 8>8  When all the men<a name="fnB152" href="jos_note.htm#fn152"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> had been circumcised, they stayed there in the camp until they had healed. 
<bqverse 9>9  The LORD said to Joshua, "Today I have taken away<a name="fnB153" href="jos_note.htm#fn153"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> the disgrace<a name="fnB154" href="jos_note.htm#fn154"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> of Egypt from you." So that place is called Gilgal<a name="fnB155" href="jos_note.htm#fn155"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> even to this day.<p>

<bqverse 10>10  So the Israelites camped in Gilgal and celebrated the Passover in the evening of the fourteenth day of the month on the plains of Jericho. 
<bqverse 11>11  They ate some of the produce of the land the day after the Passover, including unleavened bread and roasted grain.<a name="fnB156" href="jos_note.htm#fn156"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  The manna stopped appearing the day they ate<a name="fnB157" href="jos_note.htm#fn157"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> some of the produce of the land; the Israelites never ate manna again.<a name="fnB158" href="jos_note.htm#fn158"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> <a name="_Toc494011785"></a></p>
<p><i>Israel Conquers Jericho</i>

<bqverse 14>14  He answered,<a name="fnB162" href="jos_note.htm#fn162"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> "Truly I am the commander of the LORD's army.<a name="fnB163" href="jos_note.htm#fn163"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> Now I have arrived!"<a name="fnB164" href="jos_note.htm#fn164"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> Joshua bowed down with his face to the ground<a name="fnB165" href="jos_note.htm#fn165"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> and asked, "What does my master want to say to his servant?" 
<bqverse 15>15  The commander of the LORD's army answered Joshua, "Remove your sandals from your feet, because the place where you stand is holy." Joshua did so.<p>

<bqchapter 6><A NAME="6"><b>

<bqverse 2>2  The LORD told Joshua, "See, I am about to defeat Jericho for you,<a name="fnB168" href="jos_note.htm#fn168"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> along with its king and warriors.

<bqverse 6>6  So Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests and instructed them, "Pick up the ark of the covenant, and seven priests must carry seven rams' horns in front of the ark of the LORD."

<bqverse 9>9  Armed troops marched ahead of the priests blowing the horns, while the rear guard followed along behind the ark blowing rams' horns. 
<bqverse 10>10  Now Joshua had instructed the army,<a name="fnB179" href="jos_note.htm#fn179"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> "Do not give a battle cry<a name="fnB180" href="jos_note.htm#fn180"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> or raise your voices; say nothing<a name="fnB181" href="jos_note.htm#fn181"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> until the day I tell you, "Give the battle cry."<a name="fnB182" href="jos_note.htm#fn182"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> Then give the battle cry!"<a name="fnB183" href="jos_note.htm#fn183"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 12>12  Bright and early the next morning Joshua had the priests pick up the ark of the LORD.<a name="fnB186" href="jos_note.htm#fn186"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  The seven priests carrying the seven rams' horns before the ark of the LORD marched along blowing their horns. Armed troops marched ahead of them, while the rear guard followed along behind the ark of the LORD blowing rams' horns. 
<bqverse 14>14  They marched around the city one time on the second day, then returned to the camp. They did this six days in all.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  On the seventh day they were up at the crack of dawn<a name="fnB187" href="jos_note.htm#fn187"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> and marched around the city as before--only this time they marched around it seven times.<a name="fnB188" href="jos_note.htm#fn188"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 6>6  Joshua tore his clothes;<a name="fnB229" href="jos_note.htm#fn229"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> he and the leaders<a name="fnB230" href="jos_note.htm#fn230"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> of Israel lay face down on the ground before the ark of the LORD until evening<a name="fnB231" href="jos_note.htm#fn231"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> and threw dirt on their heads.<a name="fnB232" href="jos_note.htm#fn232"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  Joshua prayed,<a name="fnB233" href="jos_note.htm#fn233"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> "O, Master, LORD! Why did you bring these people across the Jordan to hand us over to the Amorites so they could destroy us?

<bqverse 9>9  When the Canaanites and all who live in the land hear about this, they will turn against us and destroy the very memory of us<a name="fnB235" href="jos_note.htm#fn235"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> from the earth.

<bqverse 10>10  The LORD responded<a name="fnB237" href="jos_note.htm#fn237"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> to Joshua, "Get up! Why are you lying there face down?<a name="fnB238" href="jos_note.htm#fn238"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 13>13  Get up! Ritually consecrate the people and tell them this: `Ritually consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, because the LORD God of Israel says, "You are contaminated,<a name="fnB245" href="jos_note.htm#fn245"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> O Israel!

<bqverse 15>15  The one caught with the riches<a name="fnB251" href="jos_note.htm#fn251"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> must be burned up<a name="fnB252" href="jos_note.htm#fn252"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> along with all who belong to him, because he violated the LORD's covenant and did such a disgraceful thing in Israel.'"<p>

<bqverse 16>16  Bright and early the next morning Joshua made Israel approach in tribal order<a name="fnB253" href="jos_note.htm#fn253"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> and the tribe of Judah was selected. 
<bqverse 17>17  He then made the clans of Judah approach and the clan of the Zerahites was selected. He made the clan of the Zerahites approach and Zabdi<a name="fnB254" href="jos_note.htm#fn254"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> was selected.<a name="fnB255" href="jos_note.htm#fn255"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  He then made his family approach man by man<a name="fnB256" href="jos_note.htm#fn256"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> and Achan son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, was selected. 
<bqverse 19>19  So Joshua said to Achan, "My son, honor<a name="fnB257" href="jos_note.htm#fn257"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD God of Israel and give him praise! Tell me what you did; don't hide anything from me!" 
<bqverse 20>20  Achan told Joshua, "It is true. I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel in this way:<a name="fnB258" href="jos_note.htm#fn258"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  I saw among the loot a nice robe from Babylon,<a name="fnB259" href="jos_note.htm#fn259"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> two hundred silver pieces,<a name="fnB260" href="jos_note.htm#fn260"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels. I wanted them, so I took them. They are hidden in the ground right in the middle of my tent with the silver underneath." <p>

<bqverse 22>22  Joshua sent messengers who ran to the tent. The loot was hidden right in his tent, with the silver underneath.<a name="fnB261" href="jos_note.htm#fn261"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23  They took it all from the middle of tent, brought it to Joshua and all the Israelites, and placed<a name="fnB262" href="jos_note.htm#fn262"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> it before the LORD. 
<bqverse 24>24  Then Joshua and all Israel took Achan, son of Zerah, along with the silver, the robe, the bar of gold, his sons, daughters, ox, donkey, sheep, tent, and all that belonged to him and brought them up to the Valley of Disaster.<a name="fnB263" href="jos_note.htm#fn263"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  Joshua said, "Why have you brought disaster<a name="fnB264" href="jos_note.htm#fn264"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> on us? The LORD will bring disaster on you today!" All Israel stoned him to death. (They also stoned and burned the others.)<a name="fnB265" href="jos_note.htm#fn265"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  Then they erected over him a large pile of stones (it remains to this very day<a name="fnB266" href="jos_note.htm#fn266"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a>) and the LORD's anger subsided. So that place is called the Valley of Disaster to this very day.

<bqverse 3>3  Joshua and the whole army marched against Ai.<a name="fnB270" href="jos_note.htm#fn270"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> Joshua selected thirty thousand brave warriors and sent them out at night.

<bqverse 12>12  He took five thousand men and set an ambush west of the city between Bethel and Ai. 
<bqverse 13>13  The army was in position--the main army north of the city and the rear guard west of the city. That night Joshua went into<a name="fnB288" href="jos_note.htm#fn288"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> the middle of the valley.<p>

<bqverse 14>14  When the king of Ai saw Israel, he and his whole army quickly got up the next day and went out to fight Israel at the meeting place near the Arabah.<a name="fnB289" href="jos_note.htm#fn289"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> But he did not realize<a name="fnB290" href="jos_note.htm#fn290"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> men were hiding behind the city.<a name="fnB291" href="jos_note.htm#fn291"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  Joshua and all Israel pretended to be defeated by them and they retreated along the way to the desert.

<bqverse 17>17  No men were left in Ai or Bethel;<a name="fnB295" href="jos_note.htm#fn295"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> they all went out after Israel.<a name="fnB296" href="jos_note.htm#fn296"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> They left the city wide open and chased Israel.<p>

<bqverse 18>18  The LORD told Joshua, "Hold out toward Ai the curved sword in your hand, for I am handing the city<a name="fnB297" href="jos_note.htm#fn297"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> over to you." So Joshua held out toward Ai the curved sword in his hand. 
<bqverse 19>19  When he held out his hand, the men waiting in ambush rose up quickly from their place and attacked.<a name="fnB298" href="jos_note.htm#fn298"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> They entered the city, captured it, and immediately set it on fire. 
<bqverse 20>20  When the men of Ai turned around, they saw<a name="fnB299" href="jos_note.htm#fn299"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> the smoke from the city ascending into the sky and were so shocked they were unable to flee in any direction.<a name="fnB300" href="jos_note.htm#fn300"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> In the meantime the men who were retreating to the desert turned against their pursuers.

<bqverse 22>22  At the same time the men who had taken the city came out to fight, and the men of Ai were trapped in the middle.<a name="fnB302" href="jos_note.htm#fn302"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> The Israelites struck them down, leaving no survivors or refugees. 
<bqverse 23>23  But they captured the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.<p>

<bqverse 27>27  But Israel did plunder the cattle and the loot of the city, in accordance with the LORD's orders to Joshua.<a name="fnB308" href="jos_note.htm#fn308"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  Joshua burned Ai and made it a permanently uninhabited mound (it remains that way to this very day).<a name="fnB309" href="jos_note.htm#fn309"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 29>29  He hung the king of Ai on a tree, leaving him exposed until evening.<a name="fnB310" href="jos_note.htm#fn310"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> At sunset Joshua ordered that his corpse be taken down from the tree.<a name="fnB311" href="jos_note.htm#fn311"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> They threw it down at the entrance of the city gate and erected over it a large pile of stones (it remains to this very day).<a name="fnB312" href="jos_note.htm#fn312"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494011788"></a></p>

<bqverse 30>30  Then Joshua built an altar for the LORD God of Israel on Mount Ebal,

<bqverse 32>32  There, in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua inscribed on the stones a duplicate of the law written by Moses.<a name="fnB315" href="jos_note.htm#fn315"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 11>11  Our leaders and all who live in our land told us, `Take provisions for your journey and go meet them. Tell them, "We are willing to be your subjects.<a name="fnB336" href="jos_note.htm#fn336"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> Make a treaty with us."' 
<bqverse 12>12  This bread of ours was warm when we packed it in our homes the day we started out to meet you,<a name="fnB337" href="jos_note.htm#fn337"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> but now it is dry and hard.<a name="fnB338" href="jos_note.htm#fn338"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  These wineskins we filled were brand new, but look how they have ripped. Our clothes and sandals have worn out because it has been a very long journey." 
<bqverse 14>14  The men examined<a name="fnB339" href="jos_note.htm#fn339"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> some of their provisions, but they failed to ask the LORD's advice.<a name="fnB340" href="jos_note.htm#fn340"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  Joshua made a peace treaty with them and agreed to let them live. The leaders of the community<a name="fnB341" href="jos_note.htm#fn341"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> sealed it with an oath.<a name="fnB342" href="jos_note.htm#fn342"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 16>16  Three days after they made the treaty with them, the Israelites found out they were from the local area and lived nearby.<a name="fnB343" href="jos_note.htm#fn343"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  So the Israelites set out and on the third day arrived at their cities--Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim. 
<bqverse 18>18  The Israelites did not attack them because the leaders of the community had sworn an oath to them in the name of the LORD God of Israel.<a name="fnB344" href="jos_note.htm#fn344"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> The whole community criticized<a name="fnB345" href="jos_note.htm#fn345"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> the leaders, 
<bqverse 19>19  but all the leaders told the whole community, "We swore an oath to them in the name of<a name="fnB346" href="jos_note.htm#fn346"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD God of Israel. So now we can't hurt<a name="fnB347" href="jos_note.htm#fn347"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> them! 
<bqverse 20>20  We must let them live so we can escape the curse attached to the oath we swore to them."<a name="fnB348" href="jos_note.htm#fn348"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  The leaders then added,<a name="fnB349" href="jos_note.htm#fn349"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> "Let them live." So they became<a name="fnB350" href="jos_note.htm#fn350"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> woodcutters and water carriers for the whole community, as the leaders had decided.<a name="fnB351" href="jos_note.htm#fn351"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 22>22  <a name="fnB352" href="jos_note.htm#fn352"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a>Joshua summoned the Gibeonites<a name="fnB353" href="jos_note.htm#fn353"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> and said to them, "Why did you trick<a name="fnB354" href="jos_note.htm#fn354"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> us by saying, `We live far away from you,' when you really live nearby?<a name="fnB355" href="jos_note.htm#fn355"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23  Now you are condemned to perpetual servitude as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God."<a name="fnB356" href="jos_note.htm#fn356"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  They said to Joshua, "It was carefully reported to your subjects<a name="fnB357" href="jos_note.htm#fn357"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> how the LORD your God commanded Moses his servant to assign you the whole land and to destroy all who live in the land from before you. Because of you we were terrified<a name="fnB358" href="jos_note.htm#fn358"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> we would lose our lives, so we did this thing. 
<bqverse 25>25 So now we are in your power.<a name="fnB359" href="jos_note.htm#fn359"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> Do to us what you think is good and appropriate.<a name="fnB360" href="jos_note.htm#fn360"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  Joshua did as they said; he kept the Israelites from killing them<a name="fnB361" href="jos_note.htm#fn361"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  and that day made them woodcutters and water carriers for the community and for the altar of the LORD at the divinely chosen site. (They continue in that capacity to this very day.)<a name="fnB362" href="jos_note.htm#fn362"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqchapter 10>
<a name="_Toc494011790"></a></p>
<p><i>Israel Defeats an Amorite Coalition</i>
<p><A NAME="10"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Adoni-Zedek, king of Jerusalem, heard how Joshua captured Ai and annihilated it and its king as he did Jericho and its king.<a name="fnB363" href="jos_note.htm#fn363"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> He also heard how<a name="fnB364" href="jos_note.htm#fn364"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> the people of Gibeon made peace with Israel and lived among them. 
<bqverse 2>2  All Jerusalem was terrified<a name="fnB365" href="jos_note.htm#fn365"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> because Gibeon was a large city, like one of the royal cities. It was larger than Ai and all its men were warriors. 
<bqverse 3>3  So King Adoni-Zedek of Jerusalem sent this message to King Hoham of Hebron, King Piram of Jarmuth, King Japhia of Lachish, and King Debir of Eglon: 
<bqverse 4>4  "Come to my aid<a name="fnB366" href="jos_note.htm#fn366"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> so we can attack Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites." 
<bqverse 5>5  So the five Amorite kings (the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon) and all their troops gathered together and advanced. They deployed their troops and fought against Gibeon.<a name="fnB367" href="jos_note.htm#fn367"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 6>6  The men of Gibeon sent this message to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, "Do not abandon<a name="fnB368" href="jos_note.htm#fn368"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> your subjects!<a name="fnB369" href="jos_note.htm#fn369"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> Rescue us! Help us! For all the Amorite kings living in the hill country are attacking us."<a name="fnB370" href="jos_note.htm#fn370"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  So Joshua and his whole army, including the bravest warriors, marched up from Gilgal.<a name="fnB371" href="jos_note.htm#fn371"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  The LORD told Joshua, "Don't be afraid of them, for I am handing them over to you.<a name="fnB372" href="jos_note.htm#fn372"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> Not one of them can resist you."<a name="fnB373" href="jos_note.htm#fn373"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  Joshua attacked them by surprise after marching all night from Gilgal.<a name="fnB374" href="jos_note.htm#fn374"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 10>10  The LORD routed<a name="fnB375" href="jos_note.htm#fn375"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> them before Israel. Israel<a name="fnB376" href="jos_note.htm#fn376"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> thoroughly defeated them<a name="fnB377" href="jos_note.htm#fn377"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> at Gibeon. They chased them up the road to the pass<a name="fnB378" href="jos_note.htm#fn378"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> of Beth Horon and struck them down all the way to Azekah and Makkedah. 
<bqverse 11>11  As they fled from Israel on the slope leading down from<a name="fnB379" href="jos_note.htm#fn379"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> Beth Horon, the LORD threw down on them large hailstones from the sky,<a name="fnB380" href="jos_note.htm#fn380"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> all the way to Azekah. They died--in fact, more died from the hailstones than the Israelites killed with the sword. <p>

<bqverse 12>12  The day the LORD delivered the Amorites over to the Israelites, Joshua prayed to LORD before Israel:<a name="fnB381" href="jos_note.htm#fn381"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> </p>
<br>"O sun, stand still over Gibeon! <br>
O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon!" </ul><p>
<bqverse 13>13  The sun stood still and the moon stood motionless while the nation took vengeance on its enemies. The event is recorded in the Scroll of the Upright One.<a name="fnB382" href="jos_note.htm#fn382"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> The sun stood motionless in the middle of the sky and did not set for about a full day.<a name="fnB383" href="jos_note.htm#fn383"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  There has not been a day like it before or since. The LORD obeyed<a name="fnB384" href="jos_note.htm#fn384"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> a man, for the LORD fought for Israel! 
<bqverse 15>15  Then Joshua and all Israel returned to the camp at Gilgal.<p>

<bqverse 16>16  The five Amorite kings<a name="fnB385" href="jos_note.htm#fn385"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> ran away and hid in the cave at Makkedah. 
<bqverse 17>17  Joshua was told, "The five kings have been found hiding in the cave at Makkedah." 
<bqverse 18>18  Joshua said, "Roll large stones over the mouth of the cave and post guards in front of it.<a name="fnB386" href="jos_note.htm#fn386"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  But don't you delay! Chase your enemies and catch them!<a name="fnB387" href="jos_note.htm#fn387"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> Don't allow them to retreat to<a name="fnB388" href="jos_note.htm#fn388"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> their cities, for the LORD your God is handing them over to you."<a name="fnB389" href="jos_note.htm#fn389"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  Joshua and the Israelites almost totally wiped them out, but some survivors did escape to the fortified cities.<a name="fnB390" href="jos_note.htm#fn390"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  Then the whole army safely returned to Joshua at the camp in Makkedah.<a name="fnB391" href="jos_note.htm#fn391"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> No one<a name="fnB392" href="jos_note.htm#fn392"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> dared threaten the Israelites.<a name="fnB393" href="jos_note.htm#fn393"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  Joshua said, "Open the cave's mouth and bring the five kings<a name="fnB394" href="jos_note.htm#fn394"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> out of the cave to me." 
<bqverse 23>23  They did as ordered;<a name="fnB395" href="jos_note.htm#fn395"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> they brought the five kings<a name="fnB396" href="jos_note.htm#fn396"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> out of the cave to him--the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon. 
<bqverse 24>24  When they brought the kings out to Joshua, he<a name="fnB397" href="jos_note.htm#fn397"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> summoned all the men of Israel and said to the commanders of the troops who accompanied him, "Come here<a name="fnB398" href="jos_note.htm#fn398"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> and put your feet on the necks of these kings." So they came up<a name="fnB399" href="jos_note.htm#fn399"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> and put their feet on their necks. 
<bqverse 25>25  Then Joshua said to them, "Don't be afraid and don't panic!<a name="fnB400" href="jos_note.htm#fn400"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> Be strong and brave, for the LORD will do the same thing to all your enemies you fight. 
<bqverse 26>26  Then Joshua executed them<a name="fnB401" href="jos_note.htm#fn401"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> and hung them on five trees. They were left hanging on the trees until evening. 
<bqverse 27>27  At sunset Joshua ordered his men to take them down from the trees.<a name="fnB402" href="jos_note.htm#fn402"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> They threw them into the cave where they had hidden and piled large stones over the mouth of the cave. (They remain to this very day.)<a name="fnB403" href="jos_note.htm#fn403"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494011791"></a></p>
<p><i>Joshua Launches a Southern Campaign</i>
<p>
<bqverse 28>28  That day Joshua captured Makkedah and put the sword to it and its king. He annihilated everyone who lived in it; he left no survivors. He did to its king what he had done to the king of Jericho.<p>

<bqverse 29>29  Joshua and all Israel marched from Makkedah to Libnah and fought against it.<a name="fnB404" href="jos_note.htm#fn404"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 30>30  The LORD handed it and its king over to Israel, and Israel<a name="fnB405" href="jos_note.htm#fn405"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> put the sword to all who lived there; they<a name="fnB406" href="jos_note.htm#fn406"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> left no survivors. They<a name="fnB407" href="jos_note.htm#fn407"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> did to its king what they<a name="fnB408" href="jos_note.htm#fn408"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> had done to the king of Jericho.<p>

<bqverse 31>31  Joshua and all Israel marched from Libnah to Lachish. He deployed his troops<a name="fnB409" href="jos_note.htm#fn409"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> and fought against it. 
<bqverse 32>32  The LORD handed Lachish over to Israel and they<a name="fnB410" href="jos_note.htm#fn410"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> captured it on the second day. They put the sword to all who lived there, just as they had done to Libnah. 
<bqverse 33>33  Then King Horam of Gezer came up to help Lachish, but Joshua struck down him and his army<a name="fnB411" href="jos_note.htm#fn411"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> until no survivors remained.<p>

<bqverse 34>34  Joshua and all Israel marched from Lachish to Eglon. They deployed troops<a name="fnB412" href="jos_note.htm#fn412"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> and fought against it. 
<bqverse 35>35  That day they captured it and put the sword to all who lived there.

<bqverse 36>36  Joshua and all Israel marched up from Eglon to Hebron and fought against it. 
<bqverse 37>37  They captured it and put the sword to its king, all its surrounding cities, and all who lived in it; they<a name="fnB415" href="jos_note.htm#fn415"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> left no survivors. As they<a name="fnB416" href="jos_note.htm#fn416"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> had done at Eglon, they<a name="fnB417" href="jos_note.htm#fn417"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> annihilated it and all who lived there.<p>

<bqverse 38>38  Joshua and all Israel turned to Debir and fought against it. 
<bqverse 39>39  They<a name="fnB418" href="jos_note.htm#fn418"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> captured it, its king, and all its surrounding cities and put the sword to them.

<bqverse 41>41  Joshua conquered the area between Kadesh Barnea and Gaza and the whole region of Goshen, all the way to Gibeon.<a name="fnB424" href="jos_note.htm#fn424"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 1>1 </b> When King Jabin of Hazor heard the news, he organized a coalition, including<a name="fnB426" href="jos_note.htm#fn426"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> King Jobab of Madon, the king of Shimron, the king of Acshaph,

<bqverse 3>3  Canaanites came<a name="fnB429" href="jos_note.htm#fn429"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> from the east and west; Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, and Jebusites from the hill country; and Hivites from below Hermon in the area<a name="fnB430" href="jos_note.htm#fn430"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> of Mizpah. 
<bqverse 4>4  These kings came out with their armies; they were as numerous as the sand on the seashore and had a large number of horses and chariots.<a name="fnB431" href="jos_note.htm#fn431"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 6>6  The LORD told Joshua, "Don't be afraid of them, for about this time tomorrow I will cause all of them to lie dead before Israel. You must hamstring their horses and burn<a name="fnB433" href="jos_note.htm#fn433"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> their chariots."

<bqverse 15>15  Moses the LORD's servant passed on the LORD's commands to Joshua, and Joshua did as he was told.

<bqverse 17>17  from Mount Halak on up to Seir, as far as Baal Gad in the Lebanon Valley below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings and executed them.<a name="fnB446" href="jos_note.htm#fn446"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  Joshua campaigned against<a name="fnB447" href="jos_note.htm#fn447"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> these kings for quite some time.<a name="fnB448" href="jos_note.htm#fn448"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  No city made peace with the Israelites (except the Hivites living in Gibeon);<a name="fnB449" href="jos_note.htm#fn449"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> they had to conquer all of them,<a name="fnB450" href="jos_note.htm#fn450"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  for the LORD determined to make them obstinate so they would attack Israel. He wanted Israel to annihilate them without mercy, as he had instructed Moses.<a name="fnB451" href="jos_note.htm#fn451"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 21>21  At that time Joshua attacked and eliminated the Anakites from the hill country<a name="fnB452" href="jos_note.htm#fn452"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a>--from Hebron, Debir, Anab, and all the hill country of Judah and Israel.<a name="fnB453" href="jos_note.htm#fn453"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> Joshua annihilated them and their cities. 
<bqverse 22>22  No Anakites were left in Israelite territory, though some remained in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod. 
<bqverse 23>23  Joshua conquered<a name="fnB454" href="jos_note.htm#fn454"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> the whole land, just as the LORD had promised Moses,<a name="fnB455" href="jos_note.htm#fn455"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> and he assigned Israel their tribal portions.<a name="fnB456" href="jos_note.htm#fn456"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> Then the land was free of war.<p>

<bqverse 3>3  Now Moses had assigned land<a name="fnB520" href="jos_note.htm#fn520"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> to the two-and-a-half tribes east of the Jordan, but he assigned no land<a name="fnB521" href="jos_note.htm#fn521"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> to the Levites.<a name="fnB522" href="jos_note.htm#fn522"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  The descendants of Joseph were considered as two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim.

<bqverse 6>6  The men of Judah approached Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, "You know what the LORD said about you and me to Moses, the man of God, at Kadesh Barnea.<a name="fnB525" href="jos_note.htm#fn525"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  I was forty years old when Moses, the LORD's servant, sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy on the land and I brought back to him an honest report.<a name="fnB526" href="jos_note.htm#fn526"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 9>9  That day Moses made this solemn promise:<a name="fnB531" href="jos_note.htm#fn531"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> `Surely the land on which you walked<a name="fnB532" href="jos_note.htm#fn532"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> will belong to you and your descendants permanently,<a name="fnB533" href="jos_note.htm#fn533"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> for you remained loyal to the LORD your God.' 
<bqverse 10>10  So now, look, the LORD has preserved my life, just as he promised, these past forty-five years since the LORD spoke these words to Moses, during which Israel traveled through the wilderness. Now look, I am today eighty-five years old.

<p><i>Joseph's Tribal Lands</i>
<p><A NAME="16"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> The land allotted to Joseph's descendants extended from the Jordan at Jericho to the waters of Jericho to the east, through the desert and on up from Jericho into the hill country of Bethel.<a name="fnB572" href="jos_note.htm#fn572"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  The southern border<a name="fnB573" href="jos_note.htm#fn573"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> extended from Bethel to Luz,<a name="fnB574" href="jos_note.htm#fn574"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> and crossed to Arkite territory at Ataroth. 
<bqverse 3>3  It then descended westward to Japhletite territory, as far as the territory of lower Beth Horon and Gezer, and ended at the sea.<p>

<bqverse 4>4  Joseph's descendants, Manasseh and Ephraim, were assigned their land.<a name="fnB575" href="jos_note.htm#fn575"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  The territory of the tribe of Ephraim by its clans included the following:<a name="fnB576" href="jos_note.htm#fn576"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> The border of their assigned land to the east was Ataroth Addar as far as upper Beth Horon. 
<bqverse 6>6  It then extended on to the sea, with Micmethath on the north. It turned eastward to Taanath Shiloh and crossed it on the east to Janoah. 
<bqverse 7>7  It then descended from Janoah to Ataroth and Naarah, touched Jericho, and extended to the Jordan River.<a name="fnB577" href="jos_note.htm#fn577"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  From Tappuah it went westward to the Valley of Kanah and ended at the sea. This is the land assigned to the tribe of Ephraim<a name="fnB578" href="jos_note.htm#fn578"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> by its clans. 
<bqverse 9>9  Also included were the cities set apart for the tribe of Ephraim within Manasseh's territory, along with their towns.<a name="fnB579" href="jos_note.htm#fn579"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 10>10  The Ephraimites<a name="fnB580" href="jos_note.htm#fn580"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> did not conquer the Canaanites living in Gezer. The Canaanites live among the Ephraimites to this very day and do hard labor as their servants.<p>

<bqchapter 17><A NAME="17"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> The tribe of Manasseh, Joseph's firstborn son, was also allotted land.<a name="fnB581" href="jos_note.htm#fn581"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> The descendants of Makir, Manasseh's firstborn and the father of Gilead, received land, for they were warriors.<a name="fnB582" href="jos_note.htm#fn582"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> They were assigned Gilead and Bashan.<a name="fnB583" href="jos_note.htm#fn583"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  The rest of Manasseh's descendants were also assigned land<a name="fnB584" href="jos_note.htm#fn584"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> by their clans, including the descendants of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These are the male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph by their clans.<p>

<bqverse 3>3  Now Zelophehad son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Makir, son of Manasseh, had no sons, only daughters. These are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 
<bqverse 4>4  They went before Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders and said, "The LORD told Moses to assign us land among our relatives."<a name="fnB585" href="jos_note.htm#fn585"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> So Joshua<a name="fnB586" href="jos_note.htm#fn586"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> assigned them land among their uncles, as the LORD had commanded.<a name="fnB587" href="jos_note.htm#fn587"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  Manasseh was allotted ten shares of land,<a name="fnB588" href="jos_note.htm#fn588"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan east of the Jordan, 
<bqverse 6>6  for the daughters of Manasseh were assigned land among his sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the descendants of Manasseh.<p>

<bqverse 7>7  The border of Manasseh went<a name="fnB589" href="jos_note.htm#fn589"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> from Asher to Micmethath which is near<a name="fnB590" href="jos_note.htm#fn590"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> Shechem. It then went south toward those who live in Tappuah. 
<bqverse 8>8  (The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah, located on the border of Manasseh, belonged to the tribe of Ephraim.) 
<bqverse 9>9  The border then descended southward to the Valley of Kanah. Ephraim was assigned cities there among the cities of Manasseh,<a name="fnB591" href="jos_note.htm#fn591"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> but the border of Manasseh was north of the valley and ended at the sea. 
<bqverse 10>10  Ephraim's territory was to the south, and Manasseh's to the north. The sea was Manasseh's<a name="fnB592" href="jos_note.htm#fn592"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> western border and their territory<a name="fnB593" href="jos_note.htm#fn593"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> touched Asher on the north and Issachar on the east. 
<bqverse 11>11  Within Issachar's and Asher's territory Manasseh was assigned Beth Shean, Ibleam, the residents of Dor, En Dor, the residents of Taanach, the residents of Megiddo, the three of Napheth,<a name="fnB594" href="jos_note.htm#fn594"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> and the towns surrounding all these cities.<a name="fnB595" href="jos_note.htm#fn595"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  But the men<a name="fnB596" href="jos_note.htm#fn596"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> of Manasseh were unable to conquer these cities; the Canaanites managed<a name="fnB597" href="jos_note.htm#fn597"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> to remain in those areas. 
<bqverse 13>13  Whenever the Israelites were strong militarily, they forced the Canaanites to do hard labor, but they never totally conquered them.<a name="fnB598" href="jos_note.htm#fn598"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 14>14  The descendants of Joseph said to Joshua, "Why have you assigned us only one tribal allotment?

<bqverse 15>15  Joshua replied to them, "Since you have so many people,<a name="fnB600" href="jos_note.htm#fn600"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> go up into the forest and clear out a place to live in the land of the Perizzites and Rephaites, for the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you." 
<bqverse 16>16  The descendants of Joseph said, "The whole hill country<a name="fnB601" href="jos_note.htm#fn601"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> is inadequate for us, and the Canaanites living down in the valley in Beth Shean and its surrounding towns and in the Valley of Jezreel have chariots with iron-rimmed wheels."<a name="fnB602" href="jos_note.htm#fn602"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Joshua Sends Home the Eastern Tribes</i>
<p><A NAME="22"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh 
<bqverse 2>2  and told them: "You have carried out all the instructions of Moses the LORD's servant, and you have obeyed all I have told you.<a name="fnB694" href="jos_note.htm#fn694"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 4>4  Now the LORD your God has made your fellow Israelites secure,<a name="fnB698" href="jos_note.htm#fn698"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> just as he promised them. So now you may turn around and go to your homes<a name="fnB699" href="jos_note.htm#fn699"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> in your own land<a name="fnB700" href="jos_note.htm#fn700"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> which Moses the LORD's servant assigned to you east of the Jordan. 
<bqverse 5>5  But carefully obey the commands and instructions Moses the LORD's servant gave you.

<bqverse 6>6  Joshua rewarded<a name="fnB706" href="jos_note.htm#fn706"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> them and sent them on their way; they returned to their homes.<a name="fnB707" href="jos_note.htm#fn707"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  (Now to one half-tribe of Manasseh, Moses had assigned land in Bashan; and to the other half Joshua had assigned land on the west side of the Jordan with their fellow Israelites.) When Joshua sent them home,<a name="fnB708" href="jos_note.htm#fn708"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> he rewarded<a name="fnB709" href="jos_note.htm#fn709"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> them, 
<bqverse 8>8  saying, "Take home<a name="fnB710" href="jos_note.htm#fn710"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> great wealth, a lot of cattle,<a name="fnB711" href="jos_note.htm#fn711"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> silver, gold, bronze, iron, and a lot of<a name="fnB712" href="jos_note.htm#fn712"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> clothing. Divide up the loot taken from your enemies with your brothers." 
<bqverse 9>9  So the Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh left the Israelites in Shiloh in the land of Canaan and headed home to their own land in Gilead,<a name="fnB713" href="jos_note.htm#fn713"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> which they acquired by the LORD's command through Moses. <a name="_Toc494011810"></a></p>
<p><i>Civil War is Averted</i>
<p>
<bqverse 10>10  The Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh came to Geliloth near the Jordan in the land of Canaan and built there, near the Jordan, an impressive altar.<a name="fnB714" href="jos_note.htm#fn714"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  The Israelites received this report:<a name="fnB715" href="jos_note.htm#fn715"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> "Look, the Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar at the entrance to<a name="fnB716" href="jos_note.htm#fn716"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> the land of Canaan, at Geliloth near the Jordan on the Israelite side." 
<bqverse 12>12  When the Israelites heard this, the entire Israelite community assembled at Shiloh to launch an attack against them.<a name="fnB717" href="jos_note.htm#fn717"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 13>13  The Israelites sent Phinehas, son of Eleazar, the priest, to the land of Gilead to the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. 
<bqverse 14>14  He was accompanied by ten leaders, one from each of the Israelite tribes, each one a family leader among the Israelite clans.<a name="fnB718" href="jos_note.htm#fn718"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  They went to the land of Gilead to the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and said to them: 
<bqverse 16>16  "The entire community of the LORD says, `Why have you disobeyed the God of Israel by turning back today from following the LORD? You built an altar for yourselves and have rebelled today against the LORD.<a name="fnB719" href="jos_note.htm#fn719"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  The sin we committed at Peor was bad enough. To this very day we have not purified ourselves; it even brought a plague on the community of the LORD.<a name="fnB720" href="jos_note.htm#fn720"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  Now today you dare to turn back<a name="fnB721" href="jos_note.htm#fn721"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> from following the LORD!

<bqverse 19>19  But if your own land<a name="fnB723" href="jos_note.htm#fn723"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> is impure,<a name="fnB724" href="jos_note.htm#fn724"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> cross over to the LORD's own land,<a name="fnB725" href="jos_note.htm#fn725"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> where the LORD himself lives,<a name="fnB726" href="jos_note.htm#fn726"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> and settle down among us.<a name="fnB727" href="jos_note.htm#fn727"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> But don't rebel against the LORD or us<a name="fnB728" href="jos_note.htm#fn728"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> by building for yourselves an altar aside from the altar of the LORD our God. 
<bqverse 20>20  When Achan son of Zerah disobeyed the command about the city's riches, the entire Israelite community was judged,<a name="fnB729" href="jos_note.htm#fn729"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> though only one man had sinned. He most certainly died for his sin!'"<a name="fnB730" href="jos_note.htm#fn730"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 21>21  The Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered the leaders<a name="fnB731" href="jos_note.htm#fn731"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> of the Israelite clans:

<bqverse 23>23  If we have built<a name="fnB736" href="jos_note.htm#fn736"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> an altar for ourselves to turn back from following the LORD by making<a name="fnB737" href="jos_note.htm#fn737"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> burnt sacrifices and grain offerings on it, or by offering<a name="fnB738" href="jos_note.htm#fn738"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> tokens of peace<a name="fnB739" href="jos_note.htm#fn739"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> on it, the LORD himself will punish us.<a name="fnB740" href="jos_note.htm#fn740"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  We swear we have done this because we were worried that<a name="fnB741" href="jos_note.htm#fn741"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> in the future your descendants would say to our descendants, `What relationship do you have with the LORD God of Israel?<a name="fnB742" href="jos_note.htm#fn742"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  The LORD made the Jordan a boundary between us and you Reubenites and Gadites.

<bqverse 26>26  So we decided to build this altar, not for burnt offerings and sacrifices,

<bqverse 28>28  We said, `If in the future they say such a thing<a name="fnB749" href="jos_note.htm#fn749"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> to us or to our descendants, we will reply, "See the model of the LORD's altar that our ancestors<a name="fnB750" href="jos_note.htm#fn750"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> made, not for burnt offerings or sacrifices, but as a reminder to us and you."'<a name="fnB751" href="jos_note.htm#fn751"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 29>29  Far be it from us to rebel against the LORD by turning back today from following after the LORD by building an altar for burnt offerings, sacrifices, and tokens of peace<a name="fnB752" href="jos_note.htm#fn752"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> aside from the altar of the LORD our God located in front of his dwelling place!"<a name="fnB753" href="jos_note.htm#fn753"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 3>3  but I took your father Abraham from beyond the river<a name="fnB803" href="jos_note.htm#fn803"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> and brought him into<a name="fnB804" href="jos_note.htm#fn804"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> the entire land of Canaan. I made his descendants numerous; I gave him Isaac, 
<bqverse 4>4  and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I assigned Mount Seir,<a name="fnB805" href="jos_note.htm#fn805"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> while Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt. 
<bqverse 5>5  I sent Moses and Aaron, and I struck Egypt down when I intervened in their land.<a name="fnB806" href="jos_note.htm#fn806"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> Then I brought you out. 
<bqverse 6>6  When I brought your fathers out of Egypt, you arrived at the sea. The Egyptians chased your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea. 
<bqverse 7>7  Your fathers<a name="fnB807" href="jos_note.htm#fn807"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> cried out for help to the LORD; he made the area between you and the Egyptians dark,<a name="fnB808" href="jos_note.htm#fn808"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> and then drowned them in the sea.<a name="fnB809" href="jos_note.htm#fn809"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> You witnessed with your very own eyes<a name="fnB810" href="jos_note.htm#fn810"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> what I did in Egypt. You lived in the wilderness for a long time.<a name="fnB811" href="jos_note.htm#fn811"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived east of the Jordan. They fought with you, but I handed them over to you; you conquered<a name="fnB812" href="jos_note.htm#fn812"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> their land and I destroyed them from before you. 
<bqverse 9>9  Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, launched an attack<a name="fnB813" href="jos_note.htm#fn813"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> against Israel. He summoned<a name="fnB814" href="jos_note.htm#fn814"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> Balaam son of Beor to call judgment down<a name="fnB815" href="jos_note.htm#fn815"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> on you. 
<bqverse 10>10  I refused to respond to Balaam; he kept<a name="fnB816" href="jos_note.htm#fn816"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> prophesying good things about<a name="fnB817" href="jos_note.htm#fn817"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> you, and I rescued you from his power.<a name="fnB818" href="jos_note.htm#fn818"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  You crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. The leaders<a name="fnB819" href="jos_note.htm#fn819"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> of Jericho, as well as the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites, and Jebusites, fought with you, but I handed them over to you. 
<bqverse 12>12  I sent terror<a name="fnB820" href="jos_note.htm#fn820"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> ahead of you to drive out before you the two<a name="fnB821" href="jos_note.htm#fn821"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> Amorite kings. I gave you the victory; it was not by your swords or bows.<a name="fnB822" href="jos_note.htm#fn822"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  I gave you a land in<a name="fnB823" href="jos_note.htm#fn823"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> which you had not worked hard; you took up residence in cities you did not build and you are eating the produce of<a name="fnB824" href="jos_note.htm#fn824"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> vineyards and olive groves you did not plant.'<p>

<bqverse 14>14  Now<a name="fnB825" href="jos_note.htm#fn825"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> obey<a name="fnB826" href="jos_note.htm#fn826"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD and worship<a name="fnB827" href="jos_note.htm#fn827"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> him with integrity and loyalty. Put aside the gods your ancestors<a name="fnB828" href="jos_note.htm#fn828"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> worshiped<a name="fnB829" href="jos_note.htm#fn829"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> beyond the river<a name="fnB830" href="jos_note.htm#fn830"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> and in Egypt and worship<a name="fnB831" href="jos_note.htm#fn831"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD. 
<bqverse 15>15  If you have no desire<a name="fnB832" href="jos_note.htm#fn832"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> to worship<a name="fnB833" href="jos_note.htm#fn833"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD, choose today whom you will worship,<a name="fnB834" href="jos_note.htm#fn834"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> whether it be the gods whom your ancestors<a name="fnB835" href="jos_note.htm#fn835"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> worshiped<a name="fnB836" href="jos_note.htm#fn836"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> beyond the river,<a name="fnB837" href="jos_note.htm#fn837"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living. But I and my family<a name="fnB838" href="jos_note.htm#fn838"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> will worship<a name="fnB839" href="jos_note.htm#fn839"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD!"<p>

<bqverse 16>16  The people responded, "Far be it from us to abandon the LORD so we can<a name="fnB840" href="jos_note.htm#fn840"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> worship<a name="fnB841" href="jos_note.htm#fn841"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> other gods! 
<bqverse 17>17  For the LORD our God took us and our fathers out of slavery<a name="fnB842" href="jos_note.htm#fn842"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> in the land of Egypt<a name="fnB843" href="jos_note.htm#fn843"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> and performed these awesome miracles<a name="fnB844" href="jos_note.htm#fn844"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> before our very eyes. He continually protected us as we traveled and when we passed through nations.<a name="fnB845" href="jos_note.htm#fn845"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  The LORD drove out from before us all the nations, including the Amorites who lived in the land. So we too will worship<a name="fnB846" href="jos_note.htm#fn846"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD, for he is our God!"<p>

<bqverse 19>19  Joshua warned<a name="fnB847" href="jos_note.htm#fn847"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> the people, "You won't keep worshiping the LORD,<a name="fnB848" href="jos_note.htm#fn848"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> for<a name="fnB849" href="jos_note.htm#fn849"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> he is a holy God.<a name="fnB850" href="jos_note.htm#fn850"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> He is a jealous God who will not forgive<a name="fnB851" href="jos_note.htm#fn851"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> your rebellion or your sins. 
<bqverse 20>20  If<a name="fnB852" href="jos_note.htm#fn852"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> you abandon the LORD and worship<a name="fnB853" href="jos_note.htm#fn853"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> foreign gods, he will turn against you;<a name="fnB854" href="jos_note.htm#fn854"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> he will bring disaster on you and destroy you,<a name="fnB855" href="jos_note.htm#fn855"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> though he once treated you well."<a name="fnB856" href="jos_note.htm#fn856"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 21>21  The people said to Joshua, "No! We really will<a name="fnB857" href="jos_note.htm#fn857"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> worship<a name="fnB858" href="jos_note.htm#fn858"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD!" 
<bqverse 22>22  Joshua said to the people, "Do you agree to be witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to worship the LORD?"<a name="fnB859" href="jos_note.htm#fn859"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> They replied, "We are witnesses."<a name="fnB860" href="jos_note.htm#fn860"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23  Joshua said,<a name="fnB861" href="jos_note.htm#fn861"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> "Now put aside the foreign gods that are among you and submit to<a name="fnB862" href="jos_note.htm#fn862"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD God of Israel."<p>

<bqverse 24>24  The people said to Joshua, "We will worship<a name="fnB863" href="jos_note.htm#fn863"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD our God and obey him."<a name="fnB864" href="jos_note.htm#fn864"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 25>25  That day Joshua drew up an agreement<a name="fnB865" href="jos_note.htm#fn865"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a> for the people, and he established rules and regulations<a name="fnB866" href="jos_note.htm#fn866"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> for them in Shechem. 
<bqverse 26>26  Joshua wrote these words in the Law Scroll of God. He then took a large stone and set it up there under the oak tree near the LORD's shrine. 
<bqverse 27>27  Joshua said to all the people, "Look, this stone will be a witness against you, for it has heard everything the LORD said to us.<a name="fnB867" href="jos_note.htm#fn867"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a> It will be a witness against you if<a name="fnB868" href="jos_note.htm#fn868"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>69</SUP></FONT></a> you deny your God." 
<bqverse 28>28  When Joshua dismissed the people, they went to their allotted portions of property.<a name="fnB869" href="jos_note.htm#fn869"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>70</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494011813"></a></p>
<p><i>An Era Ends</i>
<p>
<bqverse 29>29  After all this<a name="fnB870" href="jos_note.htm#fn870"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>71</SUP></FONT></a> Joshua son of Nun, the LORD's servant, died at the age of one hundred and ten. 
<bqverse 30>30  They buried him in his allotted territory<a name="fnB871" href="jos_note.htm#fn871"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>72</SUP></FONT></a> in Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. 
<bqverse 31>31  Israel worshiped<a name="fnB872" href="jos_note.htm#fn872"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>73</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD throughout Joshua's lifetime and as long as the elderly men who outlived him remained alive.<a name="fnB873" href="jos_note.htm#fn873"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>74</SUP></FONT></a> These men had experienced firsthand everything the LORD had done for Israel.<a name="fnB874" href="jos_note.htm#fn874"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>75</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 32>32  The bones of Joseph, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem in the part of the field that Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for one hundred pieces of money.<a name="fnB875" href="jos_note.htm#fn875"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>76</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 33>33  Eleazar son of Aaron died, and they buried him in Gibeah in the hill country of Ephraim, where his son Phinehas had been assigned land.<a name="fnB876" href="jos_note.htm#fn876"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>77</SUP></FONT></a></p>
