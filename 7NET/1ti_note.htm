 <b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Grk</i> "Paul." The word "from" is not in the Greek text, but has been supplied to indicate the sender of the letter.<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="1ti.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:1)  <i>God our Savior.</i> Use of the title "Savior" for God the Father is characteristic of 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus. It occurs six times in these letters, but only twice elsewhere in the NT. However, it occurs commonly in the OT, especially in Isaiah. It emphasizes the Father as the initiator and source of salvation.<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="1ti.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  This word implies authoritative instruction: "direct, command, give orders" (cf. 1 Tim 4:11; 5:7; 6:13, 17). See BAGD 613 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">paraggevllw</FONT>.<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="1ti.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  <i>Grk</i> "to teach other doctrines," different from apostolic teaching (cf. 1 Tim 6:3).<br>
 <a name="fn4" href="1ti.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:4)  <i>Myths and interminable genealogies.</i> These <i>myths</i> were legendary tales characteristic of the false teachers in Ephesus and Crete. See parallels in 1 Tim 4:7; 2 Tim 4:4; and Titus 1:14. They were perhaps built by speculation from the patriarchal narratives in the OT; hence the connection with <i>genealogies</i> and with wanting <i>to be teachers of the law</i> (v. 7).<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="1ti.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:4)  A few Western MSS (D* syr<sup>p,hmg</sup>) read <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oijkodomhvn </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">oikodomhn</FONT>, "God's edification") rather than <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oijkonomivan </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">oikonomian</FONT>, "God's redemptive plan"), which is read by the vast majority of witnesses.<br>
 <b>tn</b> (1:4)  More literally, "the administration of God that is by faith."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:4)  <i>God's redemptive plan.</i> The basic word (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oijkonomiva</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">oikonomia</FONT>) denotes the work of a household steward or manager or the arrangement under which he works: "household management." As a theological term it is used of the order or arrangement by which God brings redemption through Christ (God's "dispensation, plan of salvation" [Eph 1:10; 3:9]) or of human responsibility to pass on the message of that salvation ("stewardship, commission" [1 Cor 9:17; Eph 3:2; Col 1:25]). Here the former is in view (see the summary of God's plan in 1 Tim 2:3-6; 2 Tim 1:9-10; Titus 3:4-7), and Paul notes the response people must make to God's arrangement: it is "in faith" or "by faith."<br>
 <a name="fn6" href="1ti.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Grk</i> "the instruction," referring to orthodox Christian teaching and ministry in general, in contrast to that of the false teachers mentioned in 1:3-4.<br>
 <a name="fn7" href="1ti.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Grk</i> "love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith."<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="1ti.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  The Greek reinforces this negation: "understand neither what they are saying nor the things they insist on..."<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="1ti.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:9)  <i>Law.</i> There is no definite article ("the") with this word in Greek and so the inherent quality of the OT law as such is in view. But the OT law is still in mind, since the types of sinful people surveyed in vv. 9b-11a follow the general outline of sins prohibited in the Decalogue.<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="1ti.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  On this term BAGD 109 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajrsenokoivth"</FONT> states, "<i>a male who practices homosexuality, pederast, sodomite</i> 1 Cor 6:9; 1 Ti 1:10; Pol 5:3. Cf. Ro 1:27. DSBailey, Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition, '55." L&amp;N 88.280 states, "a male partner in homosexual intercourse--`homosexual.'...It is possible that <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajrsenokoivth"</FONT> in certain contexts refers to the active male partner in homosexual intercourse in contrast with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">malakov"</FONT>, the passive male partner" (cf. 1 Cor 6:9). Since there is a distinction in contemporary usage between sexual orientation and actual behavior, the qualification "practicing" was supplied in the translation, following the emphasis in BAGD.<br>
 <a name="fn11" href="1ti.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  A continuation of the preceding idea: <i>Grk</i> "teaching, according to the gospel." This use of the law is in accord with the gospel entrusted to Paul (cf. Rom 7:7-16; Gal 3:23-26). Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation.<br>

 <a name="fn21" href="1ti.htm#fnB21"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:17)  <i>Grk</i> "unto the ages of the ages," an emphatic way of speaking about eternity in Greek.<br>
 <a name="fn22" href="1ti.htm#fnB22"><sup>23</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:18)  <i>This charge</i> refers to the task Paul described to Timothy in vv. 3-7 above.<br>
 <a name="fn23" href="1ti.htm#fnB23"><sup>24</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:18)  <i>The prophecies once spoken about you</i> were apparently spoken at Timothy's ordination (cf. 1 Tim 4:14) and perhaps spoke of what God would do through him. Thus they can encourage him in his work, as the next clause says.<br>
 <a name="fn24" href="1ti.htm#fnB24"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:18)  <i>Grk</i> "that by them you might fight..." (a reference to the prophecies which can encourage him in his work).<br>
 <a name="fn25" href="1ti.htm#fnB25"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:19)  In Greek this continues the same sentence from v. 18, a participle showing the means by which Timothy will accomplish his task: <i>Grk</i> "fight the good fight, holding firmly..."<br>
 <a name="fn26" href="1ti.htm#fnB26"><sup>27</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:20)  The expression<i> handed over to Satan </i>refers to an act of discipline mentioned by Paul here and in 1 Cor 5:5, with a remedial goal, not a punitive one. The Greek word translated <i>taught</i> in this verse is used of "discipline, training of children" to lead them to correct behavior.<br>
 <a name="fn27" href="1ti.htm#fnB27"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:1)  Or "petitions."<br>
 <a name="fn28" href="1ti.htm#fnB28"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:1)  <i>Grk</i> "all men"; but here <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajnqrwvpwn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">anqrwpwn</FONT>) is used generically, referring to both men and women.<br>
 <a name="fn29" href="1ti.htm#fnB29"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:2)  For "even for kings" the Greek says simply "for kings."<br>
 <a name="fn30" href="1ti.htm#fnB30"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:3)  <i>Grk</i> "this"; the referent (such prayer for all, referring to vv. 1-2) is specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn31" href="1ti.htm#fnB31"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  <i>Grk</i> "who wants..." (but showing why such prayer is pleasing to God).<br>

 <a name="fn33" href="1ti.htm#fnB33"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:5) Traditionally this word (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mesivth"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">mesith"</FONT>) is rendered "mediator," but this conveys a wrong impression in contemporary English. Jesus was not a mediator, for example, who worked for compromise between opposing parties. Instead he was the only one able to go between man and God to enable them to have a relationship, but entirely on God's terms.<br>
 <a name="fn34" href="1ti.htm#fnB34"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:5)  <i>Grk</i> "one mediator between God and mankind, the human, Christ Jesus." <br>
 <a name="fn35" href="1ti.htm#fnB35"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:6)  <i>Revealing God's purpose at his appointed time</i> is a difficult expression without clear connection to the preceding, literally "a testimony at the proper time." This may allude to testimony about Christ's atoning work given by Paul and others (as v. 7 mentions). But it seems more likely to identify Christ's death itself as a testimony to God's gracious character (as vv. 3-4 describe). This testimony was planned from all eternity, but now has come to light at the time God intended, in the work of Christ. See 2 Tim 1:9-10; Titus 2:11-14; 3:4-7 for similar ideas. <br>
 <a name="fn36" href="1ti.htm#fnB36"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tc</b> (2:7)  Many MSS (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT>* D<sup>c</sup> H K 614 1241 <i>Byz al</i>) place <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn Cristw'/</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">en Cristw</FONT>) after <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">levgw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">legw</FONT>) to read "I am telling the truth in Christ," but this is probably an assimilation to Rom 9:1. Since it is harder to explain the omission, the shorter reading is preferred.<br>
 <a name="fn37" href="1ti.htm#fnB37"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:8)  The word translated "men" here (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajnhvr</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">anhr</FONT>) refers to adult males, not people in general. Note the command given to "the women" in v. 9.<br>
 <a name="fn38" href="1ti.htm#fnB38"><sup>12</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:8)  <i>To pray. </i>In this verse Paul resumes and concludes the section about prayer begun in 2:1-2. 1 Tim 2:3-7 described God's concern for all people as the motive for such prayer.<br>
 <a name="fn39" href="1ti.htm#fnB39"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:8)  Paul uses a common ancient posture in prayer (<i>lifting up holy hands</i>) as a figure of speech for offering requests from a holy life (<i>without anger or dispute</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn40" href="1ti.htm#fnB40"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tc</b> (2:9)  Most witnesses have <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiV tav" </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai tas</FONT>; so D<sup>1 </sup><FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Y</FONT> 1881 <i>Byz</i>) or simply <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT><sup>2</sup> D* F G 1739 <i>et pauci</i>) after <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">wJsauvtw"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jwsautw"</FONT>). A few important witnesses omit such words (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT>* A H P 33 81 1175 <i>et pauci</i>). The evidence is for the most part along "party" lines, with the shortest reading being found in the Alexandrian text, the conjunction in the Western, and the longest reading in the Byzantine tradition. Externally, the shortest reading is better. However, there is a good chance of homoiomeson or homoioteleuton in which case <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> or <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiV tav"</FONT> could have accidentally been omitted (note the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ai</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ai</FONT>] and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ai a"</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ai as</FONT>] in the word that follows): <FONT FACE="GREEK UNCIALS">wsautwskaigunaikas</FONT>/ <FONT FACE="GREEK UNCIALS">wsautwskaitasgunaikas</FONT>. Nevertheless, since both the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiV tav"</FONT> are predictable variants, intended to fill out the meaning of the text, the shortest reading seems best able to explain the rise of the others. <br>
 <a name="fn41" href="1ti.htm#fnB41"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:9)  <i>Grk</i> "to adorn themselves." Grammatically the phrase "to adorn themselves" continues Paul's words in v. 8: "I want...likewise the women to adorn themselves."<br>
 <a name="fn42" href="1ti.htm#fnB42"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:9)  This word and its cognates are used frequently in the Pastoral Epistles. It means "moderation," "sobriety," "decency," "sensibleness," or "sound judgment."<br>
 <a name="fn43" href="1ti.htm#fnB43"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:9)  Literally a continuation of v. 9a, "not with braided hair..." Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation.<br>
 <a name="fn44" href="1ti.htm#fnB44"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:11)  Or "receive instruction."<br>
 <a name="fn45" href="1ti.htm#fnB45"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:12)  <i>But I do not allow. </i>Although the Greek conjunction <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dev </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">de</FONT>)<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek"> </FONT>can have a simple connective force ("and"), it is best to take it as contrastive here: v. 11 gives a positive statement (that is to say, that a woman should <i>learn</i>). This was a radical and liberating departure from the Jewish view that women were not to learn the law.<br>
 <a name="fn46" href="1ti.htm#fnB46"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:12)  <i>Grk</i> "but to be in quietness." The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn hJsuciva/</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">en Jhsucia</FONT>) is used in Greek literature either of absolute silence or of a quiet demeanor.<br>
 <a name="fn47" href="1ti.htm#fnB47"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:14)  This phrase uses a compound form of the same verb as in v. 14a: "deceived" vs. "deceived out, completely deceived." The two verbs could be synonymous, but because of the close contrast in this context, it seems that a stronger meaning is intended for the second verb.<br>
 <a name="fn48" href="1ti.htm#fnB48"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:14)  <i>Grk</i> "has come to be in transgression" (with an emphasis on the continuing consequences of that fall).<br>
 <a name="fn49" href="1ti.htm#fnB49"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:15)  "But she will be delivered through childbearing," or "But she will be saved in spite of childbearing." This verse is notoriously difficult to interpret, though there is general agreement about one point: v. 15 is intended to lessen the impact of vv. 13-14. There are several interpretive possibilities here, though the first three can be readily dismissed (cf. D. Moo, "1 Timothy 2:11-15: Meaning and Significance," <i>TJ</i> 1 [1980]: 70-73). (1) Christian women will be saved, but only if they bear children. This view is entirely unlikely for it lays a condition on Christian women that goes beyond grace, is unsupported elsewhere in scripture, and is explicitly against Paul's and Jesus' teaching on both marriage and salvation (cf. Matt 19:12; 1 Cor 7:8-9, 26-27, 34-35; 1 Tim 5:3-10). (2) Despite the curse, Christian women will be kept safe when bearing children. This view also is unlikely, both because it has little to do with the context and because it is not true to life (especially life in the ancient world with its high infant mortality rate). (3) Despite the sin of Eve and the results to her progeny, she would be saved through <i>the</i> childbirth--that is, through the birth of the Messiah, as promised in the <i>protevangelium</i> (Gen 3:15). This view sees the singular "she" as referring first to Eve and then to all women (note the change from singular to plural in this verse). Further, it works well in the context. However, there are several problems with it: [a] The future tense (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">swqhvshtai, </FONT><FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">swqhshtai</FONT>) is unnatural if referring to the <i>protevangelium</i> or even to the historical fact of the Messiah's birth; [b] that only women are singled out as recipients of salvation seems odd since the birth of the Messiah was necessary for the salvation of both women <i>and</i> men; [c] as ingenious as this view is, its very ingenuity is its downfall, for it is overly subtle; and [d] the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">teknogoniva </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">teknogonia</FONT>) refers to the <i>process</i> of childbirth rather than the <i>product</i>. And since it is the person of the Messiah (the product of the birth) that saves us, the term is unlikely to be used in the sense given it by those who hold this view. There are three other views that have greater plausibility: (4) This may be a somewhat veiled reference to the curse of Gen 3:16 in order to clarify that though the woman led the man into transgression (v. 14b), she will be saved spiritually despite this physical reminder of her sin. The phrase is literally "through childbearing," but this does not necessarily denote means or instrument here. Instead it may show attendant circumstance (probably with a concessive force): "with, though accompanied by" (cf. BAGD 180 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">diva</FONT> III.1.c; Rom 2:27; 2 Cor 2:4; 1 Tim 4:14). (5) "It is not through active teaching and ruling activities that Christian women will be saved, but through faithfulness to their proper role, exemplified in motherhood" (Moo, 71). In this view <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">teknogoniva </FONT>is seen as a synecdoche in which child-<i>rearing</i> and other activities of motherhood are involved. Thus, one <i>evidence</i> (though clearly not an <i>essential</i> evidence) of a woman's salvation may be seen in her decision to function in this role. (6) The verse may point to some sort of proverbial expression now lost, in which "saved" means "delivered" and in which this deliverance was from some of the devastating effects of the role reversal that took place in Eden. The idea of childbearing, then, is a metonymy of part for the whole that encompasses the woman's submission again to the leadership of the man, though it has no specific soteriological import (but it certainly would have to do with the outworking of redemption).<br>
 <a name="fn50" href="1ti.htm#fnB50"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:15)  There is a shift to the plural here (<i>Grk</i> "if they continue"), but it still refers to the woman in a simple shift from generic singular to generic plural.<br>
 <a name="fn51" href="1ti.htm#fnB51"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:1)  <i>Grk</i> "the saying," referring to the following citation (see 1 Tim 1:15; 4:9; 2 Tim 2:11; Titus 3:8 for other occurrences of this phrase).<br>

 <a name="fn53" href="1ti.htm#fnB53"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:2)  Or "bishop."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:2)  Although some see the article with <i>overseer</i> as indicating a single leader at the top of the ecclesiastical structure (thus taking the article as monadic), this is hardly necessary. It is naturally taken generically (referring to the <i>class</i> of leaders known as overseers) and, in fact, finds precedent in 2:11-12 ("a woman," "a man"), 2:15 ("she"). Paul almost casually changes between singular and plural in both chapters.<br>
 <a name="fn54" href="1ti.htm#fnB54"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:2)  Or "a man married only once," "devoted solely to his wife" (see 1 Tim 3:12; 5:9; Titus 1:6). The meaning of this phrase is disputed. It is frequently understood to refer to the marital status of the church leader, excluding from leadership those who are (1) unmarried, (2) polygamous, (3) divorced, or (4) remarried after being widowed. A different interpretation is reflected in the NEB's translation "faithful to his one wife."<br>
 <a name="fn55" href="1ti.htm#fnB55"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:4)  <i>Grk</i> "having children in submission with all dignity." The last phrase, "keep his children in control without losing his dignity," may refer to the children rather than the parent: "having children who are obedient and respectful."<br>
 <a name="fn56" href="1ti.htm#fnB56"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:6)  <i>Grk</i> "that he may not become arrogant."<br>
 <a name="fn57" href="1ti.htm#fnB57"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:6)  <i>Grk</i> "the judgment of the devil," which could also mean "the judgment that the devil incurred." But see 1 Tim 1:20 for examples of the danger Paul seems to have in mind.<br>

 <a name="fn66" href="1ti.htm#fnB66"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:12)  Or "men married only once," "devoted solely to their wives" (see the note on "wife" in 1 Tim 3:2; also 1 Tim 5:9; Titus 1:6).<br>
 <a name="fn67" href="1ti.htm#fnB67"><sup>17</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:13)  The statement<i> those who have served well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves</i> is reminiscent of Jesus' teaching (Matt 20:26-28; Mark 10:43-45) that the one who wishes to be great must be a servant (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">diavkono" </FONT>[<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">diakonos</FONT>], used here of deacons) of all, just as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">diakonevw </FONT>[<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">diakonew</FONT>], as in 1 Tim 3:10, 13).<br>
 <a name="fn68" href="1ti.htm#fnB68"><sup>18</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:13)  In the phrase <i>the faith that is in Christ Jesus</i>, the term <i>faith</i> seems to mean "what Christians believe, Christian truth," rather than personal trust in Christ. So the whole phrase could mean that others will come to place greater confidence in them regarding Christian truth; but the word "confidence" is much more likely to refer to their own boldness to act on the truth of their convictions.<br>

The word "mystery" denotes a secret previously hidden in God, but now revealed and made widely known (cf. Rom 16:25; 1 Cor 2:7; 4:1; Eph 1:9; 3:3, 4, 9; 6:19; Col 1:26-27; 4:3). "Religion" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eujsevbeia</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">eusebeia</FONT>) is a word used frequently in the pastorals with a range of meanings: (1) a certain attitude toward God-- "devotion, reverence"; (2) the conduct that befits that attitude-- "godliness, piety"; and (3) the whole system of belief and approach to God that forms the basis for such attitude and conduct-- "religion, creed." See BAGD 326 s.v.; 2 Tim 3:5; 4 Macc 9:6-7, 29-30; 15:1-3; 17:7. So the following creedal statements are illustrations of the great truths that the church is charged with protecting (v. 15).<br>
 <a name="fn74" href="1ti.htm#fnB74"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tc</b> (3:16)  The Byzantine text along with a few other witnesses (most significantly, 1739; the second correctors of other MSS such as <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> A C D all tend to conform to the medieval standard, the Byzantine text, and add no independent voice to the discussion) read <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">qeos</FONT>, "God") for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jos</FONT>, "who"). On the other side, the masculine relative pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{" </FONT>is strongly supported by <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT>* A* C* F G 33 Did Epiph<i> et pauci</i>. Significantly, D* and virtually the entire Latin tradition read the neuter relative pronoun, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jo</FONT>, "which"). Thus, externally, there is no question as to what should be considered original: the Alexandrian and Western traditions are decidedly in favor of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{"</FONT>. Internally, the evidence is even stronger. What scribe would change <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov"</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{"</FONT> intentionally? "Who" is not only a theologically pale reading by comparison; it also is much harder (since the relative pronoun has no obvious antecedent). Intrinsically, the rest of 3:16, beginning with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{"</FONT>, appears to form a six-strophed hymn. As such, it is a text that is seemingly incorporated into the letter without syntactical connection. Hence, not only should we <i>not</i> look for an antecedent for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{"</FONT> (as is often done by commentators), but the relative pronoun thus is not too hard a reading (or impossible, as Dean Burgon believed). Once the genre is taken into account, the relative pronoun fits neatly into the author's style (cf. also Col 1:15; Phil 2:6 for other places in which the relative pronoun begins a hymn, as was often the case in poetry of the day). On the other hand, with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov"</FONT> written as a <i>nomen sacrum</i>, it would have looked very much like the relative pronoun: <FONT FACE="GREEK UNCIALS">q-=s </FONT>vs. <FONT FACE="GREEK UNCIALS">os</FONT>. Thus, it may have been easy to confuse one for the other. This, of course, does not solve which direction the scribes would go, although given their generally high Christology and the bland and ambiguous relative pronoun, it is doubtful that they would have replaced <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov"</FONT> with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{"</FONT>. How then should we account for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov"</FONT>? It appears that sometime after the 2nd century the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov"</FONT> reading came into existence, either via confusion with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{"</FONT> or as an intentional alteration to magnify Christ and clear up the syntax at the same time. Once it got in, this theologically rich reading was easily able to influence all the rest of the MSS it came in contact with (including MSS already written, such as <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> A C D). That this reading did not arise until after the 2nd century is evident from the Western reading, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{</FONT>. The neuter relative pronoun is certainly a "correction" of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{"</FONT>, conforming the gender to that of the neuter <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">musthvrion </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">musthrion</FONT>, "mystery"). What is significant in this reading is (1) since virtually all the Western witnesses have either the masculine or neuter relative pronoun, the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov"</FONT> reading was unknown to them in the 2nd century (when the "Western" text originated, though its place of origination was most likely in the east); they thus supply strong indirect evidence of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{"</FONT> outside of Egypt in the 2nd century; (2) even 2nd century scribes were able to misunderstand the genre, feeling compelled to alter the masculine relative pronoun because it appeared to them to be too harsh. The evidence, therefore, for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{"</FONT> is quite compelling, both externally and internally. As B. M. Metzger notes (<i>Textual Commentary</i>, 574), "no uncial (in the first hand) earlier than the eighth or ninth century (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Y</FONT>) supports <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov"</FONT>; all ancient versions presuppose <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{"</FONT> or <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{</FONT>; and no patristic writer prior to the last third of the fourth century testifies to the reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov"</FONT>." Thus, the cries of certain groups that <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov" </FONT>has to be original must be seen as special pleading in this case. To argue that heretics tampered with the text here is self-defeating, for most of the Western <i>fathers</i> who quoted the verse with the relative pronoun were quite orthodox, strongly affirming the deity of Christ. They would have dearly loved such a reading as <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov"</FONT>. Further, had heretics introduced a variant to <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeov"</FONT>, a far more natural choice would have been <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Cristov"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Cristos</FONT>, "Christ") or <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kuvrio"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kurios</FONT>, "Lord"), since the text is self-evidently about Christ, but it is not self-evidently a proclamation of his deity.

 <b>tn</b> (3:16)  <i>Grk</i> "who."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:16)  This passage has been typeset as poetry because many scholars regard this passage as poetic or hymnic. These terms are used broadly to refer to the genre of writing, not to the content. There are two broad criteria for determining if a passage is poetic or hymnic: "(a) <i>stylistic:</i> a certain rhythmical lilt when the passages are read aloud, the presence of <i>parallelismus membrorum</i> (i.e., an arrangement into couplets), the semblance of some metre, and the presence of rhetorical devices such as alliteration, <i>chiasmus</i>, and antithesis; and (b) <i>linguistic: </i>an unusual vocabulary, particularly the presence of theological terms, which is different from the surrounding context" (P. T. O'Brien, <i>Philippians </i>[NIGTC], 188-9). Classifying a passage as hymnic or poetic is important because understanding this genre can provide keys to interpretation. However, not all scholars agree that the above criteria are present in this passage, so the decision to typeset it as poetry should be viewed as a tentative decision about its genre. <br>

But there is no parallel for taking a construction like this to mean "all kinds of" or "every kind of." The normal sense is "all evils."<br>
 <a name="fn152" href="1ti.htm#fnB152"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:11)  <i>Grk</i> "O man of God."<br>
 <a name="fn153" href="1ti.htm#fnB153"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:11)  <i>Grk</i> "flee these things."<br>
 <a name="fn154" href="1ti.htm#fnB154"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:12)  This phrase literally means "compete in the good competition of the faith," using words that may refer to a race or to a boxing or wrestling match: "run the good race" or "fight the good fight." The similar phrase in 1 Tim 1:18 uses a military picture and is more literally "war the good warfare."<br>
 <a name="fn155" href="1ti.htm#fnB155"><sup>16</sup></a><b>sn</b> (6:12)  At some point in Timothy's life, he publicly acknowledged Jesus as the resurrected Lord, perhaps either at his baptism or his ordination as a minister of the gospel. With this reminder of the historical moment of his <i>good confession</i>, Timothy is encouraged to remain steadfast in his faith and to finish his life as a minister in the same way it began (see G. W. Knight, <i>Pastoral Epistles </i>[NIGTC], 264-5).<br>
 <a name="fn156" href="1ti.htm#fnB156"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:12)  <i>Grk</i> "confessed the good confession."<br>
 <a name="fn157" href="1ti.htm#fnB157"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tc</b> (6:13)  Although most witnesses have <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">soi </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">soi</FONT>, "you") after <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">paraggevllw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">parangellw</FONT>), the personal pronoun is almost demanded by the sense of the passage. Hence, the omission is the harder reading, and the addition of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">soi </FONT>is apparently a clarifying addition. Further, the shorter reading is found in several important witnesses of the Alexandrian and Western traditions, such as <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT>* F G <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Y</FONT> 6 33 1739 <i>et pauci</i>.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (6:13)  Jesus' good confession was his affirmative answer to Pilate's question "Are you the king of the Jews?" (see Matt 27:11, Mark 15:2, Luke 23:3, John 18:33-37).<br>
 <a name="fn159" href="1ti.htm#fnB159"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn </b> (6:14) The Greek word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">threvw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">threw</FONT>, traditionally translated "keep") in this context connotes preservation of and devotion to an object as well as obedience.<br>
 <a name="fn160" href="1ti.htm#fnB160"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:14)  <i>Grk</i> "the command."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (6:14)  The <i>command </i>refers to the duties laid upon Timothy for his ministry in Ephesus (1 Tim 1:3-20; 6:2c-5).<br>
 <a name="fn161" href="1ti.htm#fnB161"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:15)  <i>Grk</i> "which." All of 1 Tim 6:15 is a relative clause which refers back to "appearing" in v.14. The phrase "whose appearing" was supplied to clarify this connection.<br>
