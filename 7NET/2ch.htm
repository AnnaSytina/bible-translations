<p><A NAME="1"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Solomon son of David solidified his royal authority,<a name="fnB0" href="2ch_note.htm#fn0"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> for<a name="fnB1" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD his God was with him and greatly magnified him.<p>

<bqverse 2>2  Solomon addressed all Israel, including those who commanded units of a thousand and a hundred, the judges, and all the leaders of all Israel who were heads of families. 
<bqverse 3>3  Solomon and the entire assembly went to the worship center<a name="fnB2" href="2ch_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> in Gibeon, for the tent where they met God<a name="fnB3" href="2ch_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> was located there, which Moses the LORD's servant had made in the desert. 
<bqverse 4>4  (Now David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim to the place he had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 5>5  But the bronze altar made by Bezalel son of Uri, son of Hur, was in front of the LORD's tabernacle.<a name="fnB4" href="2ch_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> Solomon and the entire assembly prayed to him<a name="fnB5" href="2ch_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> there.) 
<bqverse 6>6  Solomon went up to the bronze altar before the LORD which was at the meeting tent, and he offered up a thousand burnt sacrifices.<p>

<bqverse 7>7  That night God appeared<a name="fnB6" href="2ch_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> to Solomon and said to him, "Tell me,<a name="fnB7" href="2ch_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> what I should give you?" 
<bqverse 8>8  Solomon replied to God, "You demonstrated<a name="fnB8" href="2ch_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> great loyalty to my father David and have made me king in his place. 
<bqverse 9>9  Now, LORD God, may your promise<a name="fnB9" href="2ch_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> to my father David be realized,<a name="fnB10" href="2ch_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> for you have made me king over a great nation as numerous as the dust of the earth. 
<bqverse 10>10  Now give me wisdom and discernment so<a name="fnB11" href="2ch_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> I can effectively lead this nation.<a name="fnB12" href="2ch_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> Otherwise<a name="fnB13" href="2ch_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> no one is able<a name="fnB14" href="2ch_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> to make judicial decisions for<a name="fnB15" href="2ch_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> this great nation of yours."<a name="fnB16" href="2ch_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 11>11  God said to Solomon, "Because you desire this,<a name="fnB17" href="2ch_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and did not ask for riches, wealth, and honor, or for vengeance on your enemies,<a name="fnB18" href="2ch_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> and because you did not ask for long life,<a name="fnB19" href="2ch_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> but requested wisdom and discernment so you can make judicial decisions for my people over whom I have made you king, 
<bqverse 12>12  you are granted wisdom and discernment.<a name="fnB20" href="2ch_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> Furthermore I am giving you riches, wealth, and honor surpassing that of any king before or after you."<a name="fnB21" href="2ch_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 13>13  Solomon left the meeting tent at the worship center in Gibeon and went to Jerusalem, where he reigned over Israel.<a name="fnB22" href="2ch_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494012129"></a></p>
<p><i>Solomon's Wealth</i>
<p>
<bqverse 14>14  Solomon accumulated<a name="fnB23" href="2ch_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> chariots and horses. He had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses. He kept them in assigned cities and in Jerusalem.<a name="fnB24" href="2ch_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  The king made silver and gold as plentiful<a name="fnB25" href="2ch_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> in Jerusalem as stones; cedar was<a name="fnB26" href="2ch_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> as plentiful as sycamore fig trees are in the lowlands.<a name="fnB27" href="2ch_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  Solomon acquired his horses from Egypt<a name="fnB28" href="2ch_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> and from Que; the king's traders purchased them from Que. 
<bqverse 17>17  They paid six hundred silver pieces for each chariot from Egypt, and one hundred fifty silver pieces for each horse. They also sold chariots and horses to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Syria.<a name="fnB29" href="2ch_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Solomon Gathers Building Materials for the Temple</i>

<bqverse 1>1 </b><i>(1.18)</i><a name="fnB30" href="2ch_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> Solomon ordered a temple to be built to honor the LORD, as well as a royal palace for himself.<a name="fnB31" href="2ch_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2 <i>(2.1)</i>Solomon had<a name="fnB32" href="2ch_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> seventy thousand common laborers<a name="fnB33" href="2ch_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> and eighty thousand stonemasons<a name="fnB34" href="2ch_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> in the hills, in addition to thirty-six hundred supervisors.<a name="fnB35" href="2ch_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 3>3  Solomon sent a message to King Huram<a name="fnB36" href="2ch_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> of Tyre: "Help me<a name="fnB37" href="2ch_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> as you did my father David, when you sent him cedar logs<a name="fnB38" href="2ch_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> for the construction of his palace.<a name="fnB39" href="2ch_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  Look, I am ready to build a temple to honor<a name="fnB40" href="2ch_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD my God and to dedicate it to him in order to burn fragrant incense before him, to set out the bread that is regularly displayed,<a name="fnB41" href="2ch_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> and to offer burnt sacrifices each morning and evening, and on Sabbaths, new moon festivals, and at other times appointed by the LORD our God. This is something Israel must do on a permanent basis.<a name="fnB42" href="2ch_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  I will build a great temple, for our God is greater than all gods. 
<bqverse 6>6  Of course, who can really build a temple for him, since the sky<a name="fnB43" href="2ch_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> and the highest heavens cannot contain him? Who am I that I should build him a temple! It will really be just a place to offer sacrifices before him.<a name="fnB44" href="2ch_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 7>7  "Now send me a man who is skilled in working with gold, silver, bronze, and iron, as well as purple, crimson, and violet colored fabrics, and who knows how to engrave. He will work with my skilled craftsmen here in Jerusalem and Judah, whom my father David provided. 
<bqverse 8>8  Send me cedars, evergreens, and algum<a name="fnB45" href="2ch_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> trees from Lebanon, for I know your servants are adept<a name="fnB46" href="2ch_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> at cutting down trees in Lebanon. My servants will work with your servants 
<bqverse 9>9  to supply me with large quantities of timber, for I am building a great, magnificent temple. 
<bqverse 10>10  Look, I will pay your servants who cut the timber twenty thousand kors<a name="fnB47" href="2ch_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> of ground wheat, twenty thousand kors of barley, one hundred twenty thousand gallons<a name="fnB48" href="2ch_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> of wine, and one hundred twenty thousand gallons of olive oil."<p>

<bqverse 11>11  King Huram<a name="fnB49" href="2ch_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> of Tyre sent this letter to Solomon: "Because the LORD loves his people, he has made you their king." 
<bqverse 12>12  Huram also said, "Worthy of praise is the LORD God of Israel, who made the sky and the earth! He has given David a wise son who has discernment and insight and will build a temple for the LORD, as well as a royal palace for himself.<a name="fnB50" href="2ch_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  Now I am sending you Huram Abi,<a name="fnB51" href="2ch_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> a skilled and capable man, 
<bqverse 14>14  whose mother is a Danite and whose father is a Tyrian.<a name="fnB52" href="2ch_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> He knows how to work with gold, silver, bronze, iron, stones, and wood, as well as purple, violet, white, and crimson fabrics. He knows how to do all kinds of engraving and understands any design given to him. He will work with your skilled craftsmen and the skilled craftsmen of my lord David your father. 
<bqverse 15>15  Now let my lord send to his servants the wheat barley, olive oil, and wine he has promised; 
<bqverse 16>16  we will get all the timber you need from Lebanon<a name="fnB53" href="2ch_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> and bring it<a name="fnB54" href="2ch_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> in raft-like bundles<a name="fnB55" href="2ch_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> by sea to Joppa. You can then haul it on up to Jerusalem."<p>

<bqverse 17>17  Solomon took a census<a name="fnB56" href="2ch_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> of all the male resident foreigners in the land of Israel, after the census his father David had taken. There were 153,600 in all. 
<bqverse 18>18  He designated<a name="fnB57" href="2ch_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> seventy thousand as common laborers,<a name="fnB58" href="2ch_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> eighty thousand as stonemasons<a name="fnB59" href="2ch_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> in the hills, and thirty-six hundred as supervisors to make sure the people completed the work.<a name="fnB60" href="2ch_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>The Building of the Temple</i>
<p><A NAME="3"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Solomon began building the LORD's temple in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared to his father David. This was the place that David prepared at the threshing floor of Ornan<a name="fnB61" href="2ch_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> the Jebusite. 
<bqverse 2>2  He began building on the second day of the second month of the fourth year of his reign.<a name="fnB62" href="2ch_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 3>3  Solomon laid the foundation for God's temple;<a name="fnB63" href="2ch_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> its length (determined according to the old standard of measure) was ninety feet, and its width thirty feet.<a name="fnB64" href="2ch_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  The porch in front of the main hall was thirty feet long, corresponding to the width of the temple,<a name="fnB65" href="2ch_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and its height was thirty feet.<a name="fnB66" href="2ch_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> He plated the inside with pure gold. 
<bqverse 5>5  He paneled<a name="fnB67" href="2ch_note.htm#fn67"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> the main hall<a name="fnB68" href="2ch_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> with boards made from evergreen trees<a name="fnB69" href="2ch_note.htm#fn69"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> and plated it with fine gold, decorated with palm trees and chains.<a name="fnB70" href="2ch_note.htm#fn70"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  He decorated the temple with precious stones; the gold he used came from Parvaim.<a name="fnB71" href="2ch_note.htm#fn71"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  He overlaid the temple's rafters, thresholds, walls and doors with gold; he carved decorative cherubim on the walls.<p>

<bqverse 8>8  He made the most holy place;<a name="fnB72" href="2ch_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> its length was thirty feet,<a name="fnB73" href="2ch_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> corresponding to the width of the temple, and its width thirty feet.<a name="fnB74" href="2ch_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> He plated it with six hundred units<a name="fnB75" href="2ch_note.htm#fn75"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> of fine gold. 
<bqverse 9>9  The gold nails weighed fifty shekels; he also plated the upper areas with gold. 
<bqverse 10>10  In the most holy place he made two images of cherubim and plated them with gold. 
<bqverse 11>11  The combined wing span of the cherubs was thirty feet.<a name="fnB76" href="2ch_note.htm#fn76"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> One of the first cherub's wings was seven and one-half feet long and touched one wall of the temple; its other wing was also seven and one-half feet long and touched one of the second cherub's wings.<a name="fnB77" href="2ch_note.htm#fn77"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  Likewise one of the second cherub's wings was seven and one-half feet long and touched the other wall of the temple; its other wing was also seven and one-half feet long and touched one of the first cherub's wings.<a name="fnB78" href="2ch_note.htm#fn78"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  The combined wingspan of these cherubim was thirty feet.<a name="fnB79" href="2ch_note.htm#fn79"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> They stood upright, facing inward.<a name="fnB80" href="2ch_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  He made the curtain out of violet, purple, crimson, and white fabrics, and embroidered on it decorative cherubim.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  In front of the temple he made two pillars which had a combined length<a name="fnB81" href="2ch_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> of fifty-two and one-half feet,<a name="fnB82" href="2ch_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> with each having a plated capital seven and one-half feet high.<a name="fnB83" href="2ch_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  He made ornamental chains<a name="fnB84" href="2ch_note.htm#fn84"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> and put them on top of the pillars. He also made one hundred pomegranate-shaped ornaments and arranged them within the chains. 
<bqverse 17>17  He set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right side and the other on the left.<a name="fnB85" href="2ch_note.htm#fn85"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> He named the one on the right Jachin,<a name="fnB86" href="2ch_note.htm#fn86"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> and the one on the left Boaz.<a name="fnB87" href="2ch_note.htm#fn87"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqchapter 4><A NAME="4"><b>

<bqverse 2>2  He also made the big bronze basin called "The Sea."<a name="fnB91" href="2ch_note.htm#fn91"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> It measured fifteen feet<a name="fnB92" href="2ch_note.htm#fn92"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> from rim to rim, was circular in shape, and stood seven and one-half feet<a name="fnB93" href="2ch_note.htm#fn93"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> high.

<bqverse 4>4  "The Sea" stood on top of twelve bulls. Three faced northward, three westward, three southward, and three eastward. "The Sea" was placed on top of them, and they all faced outward.<a name="fnB96" href="2ch_note.htm#fn96"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  It was four fingers thick and its rim was like that of a cup shaped like a lily blossom. It could hold 18,000 gallons.<a name="fnB97" href="2ch_note.htm#fn97"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  He made ten washing basins; he put five on the south side and five on the north side. In them they rinsed the items used for burnt sacrifices; the priests washed in "The Sea." <p>

<bqverse 7>7  He made ten gold lampstands according to specifications and put them in the temple, five on the right and five on the left. 
<bqverse 8>8  He made ten tables and set them in the temple, five on the right and five on the left. He also made one hundred gold bowls. 
<bqverse 9>9  He made the courtyard of the priests and the large enclosure and its doors;<a name="fnB98" href="2ch_note.htm#fn98"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> he plated their doors with bronze. 
<bqverse 10>10  He put "The Sea" on the south side, in the southeast corner. <p>

<bqverse 11>11  Huram<a name="fnB99" href="2ch_note.htm#fn99"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> made the pots, shovels, and bowls.

<bqverse 12>12  He made<a name="fnB101" href="2ch_note.htm#fn101"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> the two pillars, the two bowl-shaped tops of the pillars, the latticework for the bowl-shaped tops of the two pillars, 
<bqverse 13>13  the four hundred pomegranate-shaped ornaments for the latticework of the two pillars (each latticework had two rows of these ornaments at the bowl-shaped top of the pillar),

<bqverse 17>17  The king had them cast in earthen foundries<a name="fnB106" href="2ch_note.htm#fn106"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> in the region of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan. 
<bqverse 18>18  Solomon made so many of these items they did not weigh the bronze.<a name="fnB107" href="2ch_note.htm#fn107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 19>19  Solomon also made these items for God's temple: the gold altar, the tables on which the bread offered to God<a name="fnB108" href="2ch_note.htm#fn108"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> was kept, 
<bqverse 20>20  the pure gold lampstands and their lamps which burned as specified at the entrance to the inner sanctuary, 
<bqverse 21>21  the pure gold flower-shaped ornaments, lamps, and tongs, 
<bqverse 22>22  the pure gold trimming shears, basins, pans, and censers, and the gold door sockets for the inner sanctuary (the most holy place) and for the doors of the main hall of the temple. 
<bqchapter 5><A NAME="5"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> When Solomon had finished constructing the LORD's temple, he put the holy items that belonged to his father David (the silver, gold, and all the other articles) in the treasuries of God's temple.<a name="_Toc494012132"></a></p>
<p><i>Solomon Moves the Ark into the Temple</i>
<p>
<bqverse 2>2  Then Solomon convened Israel's elders--all the leaders of the Israelite tribes and families--in Jerusalem, so they could witness the transfer of the ark of the LORD's covenant from the City of David<a name="fnB109" href="2ch_note.htm#fn109"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> (that is, Zion).<a name="fnB110" href="2ch_note.htm#fn110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  All the men of Israel assembled before the king during the festival<a name="fnB111" href="2ch_note.htm#fn111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> in the seventh month.<a name="fnB112" href="2ch_note.htm#fn112"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  When all Israel's elders had arrived, the Levites lifted the ark. 
<bqverse 5>5  The priests and Levites carried the ark, the tent where God appeared to his people,<a name="fnB113" href="2ch_note.htm#fn113"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> and all the holy items in the tent.<a name="fnB114" href="2ch_note.htm#fn114"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  Now King Solomon and all the Israelites who had assembled with him went on ahead of the ark and sacrificed more sheep and cattle than could be counted or numbered.<a name="fnB115" href="2ch_note.htm#fn115"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 7>7  The priests brought the ark of the LORD's covenant to its assigned<a name="fnB116" href="2ch_note.htm#fn116"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, in the most holy place under the wings of the cherubs. 
<bqverse 8>8  The cherubs' wings extended over the place where the ark sat; the cherubs overshadowed the ark and its poles.<a name="fnB117" href="2ch_note.htm#fn117"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  The poles were so long the ends of them extending out from the ark were visible from in front of the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen from beyond that point.<a name="fnB118" href="2ch_note.htm#fn118"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> They have remained there to this very day. 
<bqverse 10>10  There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets Moses had placed there in Horeb.<a name="fnB119" href="2ch_note.htm#fn119"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> (It was there that<a name="fnB120" href="2ch_note.htm#fn120"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD made an agreement with the Israelites after he brought them out of the land of Egypt.)<p>

<bqverse 11>11  The priests left the holy place.<a name="fnB121" href="2ch_note.htm#fn121"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> All the priests who participated had consecrated themselves, no matter which division they represented.<a name="fnB122" href="2ch_note.htm#fn122"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  All the Levites who were musicians, including Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and relatives, wore linen. They played cymbals and stringed instruments as they stood east of the altar. They were accompanied by one hundred twenty priests who blew trumpets. 
<bqverse 13>13  The trumpeters and musicians played together, praising and giving thanks to the LORD. Accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and other instruments, they loudly praised the LORD, singing:<a name="fnB123" href="2ch_note.htm#fn123"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> "Certainly he is good; certainly his loyal love endures!" Then a cloud filled the LORD's temple.<a name="fnB124" href="2ch_note.htm#fn124"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  The priests could not carry out their duties<a name="fnB125" href="2ch_note.htm#fn125"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> because of the cloud; the LORD's splendor filled God's temple.<p>

<bqverse 8>8  The LORD told my father David, `It is right for you to have a strong desire to build a temple to honor me.<a name="fnB135" href="2ch_note.htm#fn135"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 12>12  He stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the entire assembly of Israel and spread out his hands.

<bqverse 2>2  The priests were unable to enter the LORD's temple because the LORD's splendor filled the LORD's temple.

<bqverse 4>4  The king and all Israel were presenting sacrifices to the LORD.

<bqverse 7>7  Solomon consecrated the middle of the courtyard that is in front of the LORD's temple.

<p><i>The Lord Gives Solomon a Promise and a Warning</i>

<bqverse 12>12  the LORD appeared to Solomon at night and said to him: "I have answered<a name="fnB215" href="2ch_note.htm#fn215"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> your prayer and chosen this place to be my temple where sacrifices are to be made.<a name="fnB216" href="2ch_note.htm#fn216"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  When<a name="fnB217" href="2ch_note.htm#fn217"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> I close up the sky<a name="fnB218" href="2ch_note.htm#fn218"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> so that it doesn't rain, or command locusts to devour the land's vegetation,<a name="fnB219" href="2ch_note.htm#fn219"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> or send a plague among my people,

<p><i>Building Projects and Commercial Efforts</i>
<p><A NAME="8"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> After twenty years, during which Solomon built the LORD's temple and his royal palace, 
<bqverse 2>2  Solomon rebuilt the cities that Huram<a name="fnB243" href="2ch_note.htm#fn243"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> had given him and settled Israelites there. 
<bqverse 3>3  Solomon went to Hamath Zobah and seized it. 
<bqverse 4>4  He built up Tadmor in the wilderness and all the storage cities he had built in Hamath. 
<bqverse 5>5  He made upper Beth Horon and lower Beth Horon fortified cities with walls and strong gates,<a name="fnB244" href="2ch_note.htm#fn244"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  and built up Baalath, all the storage cities that belonged to him,<a name="fnB245" href="2ch_note.htm#fn245"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> and all the cities where chariots and horses were kept.<a name="fnB246" href="2ch_note.htm#fn246"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> He built whatever he wanted in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and throughout his entire kingdom.<a name="fnB247" href="2ch_note.htm#fn247"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 7>7  Now several non-Israelite peoples were left in the land after the conquest of Joshua, including the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.<a name="fnB248" href="2ch_note.htm#fn248"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  Their descendants remained in the land (the Israelites were unable to wipe them out). Solomon conscripted them for his work crews and they continue in that role to this very day.<a name="fnB249" href="2ch_note.htm#fn249"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  Solomon did not assign Israelites to these work crews;<a name="fnB250" href="2ch_note.htm#fn250"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> the Israelites served as his soldiers, officers, charioteers, and commanders of his chariot forces.<a name="fnB251" href="2ch_note.htm#fn251"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  These men worked for Solomon as supervisors; there were a total of two hundred fifty men who were in charge of the people.<a name="fnB252" href="2ch_note.htm#fn252"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 11>11  Solomon moved Pharaoh's daughter up from the City of David<a name="fnB253" href="2ch_note.htm#fn253"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> to the palace he had built for her, for he said, "My wife must not live in the palace of King David of Israel, for the places where the ark of the LORD has entered are holy."<p>

<bqverse 12>12  Then Solomon offered burnt sacrifices to the LORD on the altar of the LORD which he had built in front of the temple's porch.<a name="fnB254" href="2ch_note.htm#fn254"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  He observed the daily requirements for sacrifices that Moses had specified for sabbaths, new moon festivals, and the three annual celebrations--the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Temporary Shelters.<a name="fnB255" href="2ch_note.htm#fn255"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  As his father David had decreed, Solomon<a name="fnB256" href="2ch_note.htm#fn256"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> appointed the divisions of the priests to do their assigned tasks, the levitical orders to lead worship and help the priests with their daily tasks,<a name="fnB257" href="2ch_note.htm#fn257"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> and the divisions of the gatekeepers to serve at their assigned gates.<a name="fnB258" href="2ch_note.htm#fn258"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> This was what David the man of God had ordered.<a name="fnB259" href="2ch_note.htm#fn259"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  They did not neglect any detail of the king's orders pertaining to the priests, Levites, and treasuries.<a name="fnB260" href="2ch_note.htm#fn260"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 16>16  All the work ordered by Solomon was completed, from the day the foundation of the LORD's temple was laid until it was finished; the LORD's temple was completed.<p>

<bqverse 17>17  Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and to Elath on the coast in the land of Edom. 
<bqverse 18>18  Huram sent him ships and some of his sailors, men who were well acquainted with the sea. They sailed with Solomon's men to Ophir,<a name="fnB261" href="2ch_note.htm#fn261"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> and took from there four hundred fifty units<a name="fnB262" href="2ch_note.htm#fn262"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> of gold, which they brought to King Solomon.

<bqverse 17>17  The king made a large throne decorated with ivory and overlaid it with pure gold.

<bqverse 4>4  "Your father made us work too hard!<a name="fnB319" href="2ch_note.htm#fn319"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> Now if you lighten the demands he made and don't make us work as hard, we will serve you."<a name="fnB320" href="2ch_note.htm#fn320"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  He said to them, "Go away for three days, then return to me." So the people went away.<p>

<bqverse 6>6  King Rehoboam consulted with the older advisers who had served<a name="fnB321" href="2ch_note.htm#fn321"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> his father Solomon when he had been alive. He asked them,<a name="fnB322" href="2ch_note.htm#fn322"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> "How do you advise me to answer these people?" 
<bqverse 7>7  They said to him, "If you are fair to these people, grant their request, and are cordial to them, they will be your servants from this time forward."<a name="fnB323" href="2ch_note.htm#fn323"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  But Rehoboam rejected their advice and consulted the young advisers who served him, with whom he had grown up.<a name="fnB324" href="2ch_note.htm#fn324"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  He asked them, "How do you advise me to respond to these people who said to me, `Lessen the demands your father placed on us'?"<a name="fnB325" href="2ch_note.htm#fn325"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  The young advisers with whom he had grown up said to him, "Say this to these people who say to you, `Your father made us work hard, but now lighten our burden'<a name="fnB326" href="2ch_note.htm#fn326"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a>--say this to them: `I am a lot tougher than my father!<a name="fnB327" href="2ch_note.htm#fn327"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  My father imposed heavy demands on you; I will make them even heavier.<a name="fnB328" href="2ch_note.htm#fn328"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> My father punished you with ordinary whips; I will punish you with whips that really sting your flesh.'"<a name="fnB329" href="2ch_note.htm#fn329"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 12>12  Jeroboam and all the people reported to Rehoboam on the third day, just as the king had ordered when he said, "Return to me on the third day." 
<bqverse 13>13  The king responded to the people harshly. He<a name="fnB330" href="2ch_note.htm#fn330"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> rejected the advice of the older men 
<bqverse 14>14  and followed the advice of the younger ones. He said, "My father imposed heavy demands on you;<a name="fnB331" href="2ch_note.htm#fn331"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> I will make them even heavier.<a name="fnB332" href="2ch_note.htm#fn332"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> My father punished you with ordinary whips; I will punish you with whips that really sting your flesh."<a name="fnB333" href="2ch_note.htm#fn333"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  The king refused to listen to the people, because God was instigating this turn of events<a name="fnB334" href="2ch_note.htm#fn334"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> so that he might bring to pass the prophetic announcement he had made<a name="fnB335" href="2ch_note.htm#fn335"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> through Achijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.<p>

<bqverse 16>16  When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, the people answered the king, "We have no portion in David--no share in the son of Jesse!<a name="fnB336" href="2ch_note.htm#fn336"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> Return to your homes, O Israel!<a name="fnB337" href="2ch_note.htm#fn337"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> Now, look after your own dynasty, O David!"<a name="fnB338" href="2ch_note.htm#fn338"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> So all Israel returned to their homes.<a name="fnB339" href="2ch_note.htm#fn339"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  (Rehoboam continued to rule over the Israelites who lived in the cities of Judah.) 
<bqverse 18>18  King Rehoboam sent Hadoram,<a name="fnB340" href="2ch_note.htm#fn340"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> the supervisor of the work crews, out after them, but the Israelites stoned him to death. King Rehoboam managed to hop into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 19>19  So Israel has been in rebellion against the Davidic dynasty to this very day.<p>

<bqchapter 11><A NAME="11"><b>

<p><i>Rehoboam's Reign</i>
<p>
<bqverse 5>5  Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem; he built up these fortified cities throughout Judah: 
<bqverse 6>6  Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, 
<bqverse 7>7  Beth Zur, Soco, Adullam, 
<bqverse 8>8  Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 
<bqverse 9>9  Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 
<bqverse 10>10  Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. These were the fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin. 
<bqverse 11>11  He fortified these cities and placed officers in them, as well as storehouses of food, olive oil, and wine. 
<bqverse 12>12  In each city there were shields and spears; he strongly fortified them.<a name="fnB345" href="2ch_note.htm#fn345"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.<p>

<bqverse 13>13  The priests and Levites who lived throughout Israel supported him, no matter where they resided.<a name="fnB346" href="2ch_note.htm#fn346"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  The Levites even left their pasturelands and their property behind and came to Judah and Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons prohibited them from serving as the LORD's priests. 
<bqverse 15>15  Jeroboam<a name="fnB347" href="2ch_note.htm#fn347"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> appointed his own priests to serve at the worship centers<a name="fnB348" href="2ch_note.htm#fn348"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> and to lead in the worship of the goat idols and calf idols he had made.<a name="fnB349" href="2ch_note.htm#fn349"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  Those among all the Israelite tribes who were determined to worship the LORD God of Israel followed them to Jerusalem<a name="fnB350" href="2ch_note.htm#fn350"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> to sacrifice to the LORD God of their ancestors.<a name="fnB351" href="2ch_note.htm#fn351"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  They supported<a name="fnB352" href="2ch_note.htm#fn352"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> the kingdom of Judah and were loyal to<a name="fnB353" href="2ch_note.htm#fn353"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> Rehoboam son of Solomon for three years; they followed the edicts of<a name="fnB354" href="2ch_note.htm#fn354"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> David and Solomon for three years.<p>

<bqverse 18>18  Rehoboam married<a name="fnB355" href="2ch_note.htm#fn355"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> Machalath the daughter of David's son Jerimoth and of<a name="fnB356" href="2ch_note.htm#fn356"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> Abihail, the daughter of Jesse's son Eliab. 
<bqverse 19>19  She bore him sons named Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. 
<bqverse 20>20  He later married Maachah the daughter of Absalom. She bore to him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. 
<bqverse 21>21  Rehoboam loved Maachah daughter of Absalom move than his other wives and concubines.<a name="fnB357" href="2ch_note.htm#fn357"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> He had eighteen wives and sixty concubines; he fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.<p>

<bqverse 22>22  Rehoboam appointed Abijah son of Maachah as the leader over his brothers, for he intended to name him his successor.<a name="fnB358" href="2ch_note.htm#fn358"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23  He wisely placed some of his many sons throughout the regions of Judah and Benjamin in the various fortified cities.<a name="fnB359" href="2ch_note.htm#fn359"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> He supplied them with abundant provisions and acquired many wives for them.<a name="fnB360" href="2ch_note.htm#fn360"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqchapter 12><A NAME="12"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> After Rehoboam's rule was established and solidified, he and all Israel rejected the law of the LORD. 
<bqverse 2>2  Because they were unfaithful to the LORD, in King Rehoboam's fifth year King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem,. 
<bqverse 3>3  He had twelve hundred chariots, sixty thousand horsemen, and an innumerable number of soldiers who accompanied him from Egypt, including Libyans, Sukkites, and Cushites. 
<bqverse 4>4  He captured the fortified cities of Judah and marched against Jerusalem.<p>

<bqverse 5>5  Shemaiah the prophet visited Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah who were assembled in Jerusalem because of Shishak. He said to them, "This is what the LORD says: `You have rejected me, so I have rejected you and will hand you over to Shishak.'"<a name="fnB361" href="2ch_note.htm#fn361"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  The leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, "The LORD is fair."<a name="fnB362" href="2ch_note.htm#fn362"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  When the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, he gave this message to Shemaiah:<a name="fnB363" href="2ch_note.htm#fn363"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> "They have humbled themselves, so I will not destroy them.

<bqverse 9>9  King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the LORD's temple and of the royal palace; he took everything, including the gold shields Solomon had made. 
<bqverse 10>10  King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned them to the officers of the royal guard<a name="fnB368" href="2ch_note.htm#fn368"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> who protected the entrance to the royal palace.

<bqverse 12>12  So when Rehoboam<a name="fnB370" href="2ch_note.htm#fn370"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> humbled himself, the LORD relented from his anger and did not annihilate him;<a name="fnB371" href="2ch_note.htm#fn371"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> Judah experienced some good things.<a name="fnB372" href="2ch_note.htm#fn372"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Abijah's Reign</i>
<p><A NAME="13"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> In the eighteenth of the reign of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over Judah. 
<bqverse 2>2  He ruled for three years in Jerusalem. His mother was Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel from Gibeah.<p>
There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. 
<bqverse 3>3  Abijah launched the attack with four hundred thousand well-trained warriors,<a name="fnB381" href="2ch_note.htm#fn381"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> while Jeroboam deployed against him eight hundred thousand well-trained warriors.<a name="fnB382" href="2ch_note.htm#fn382"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 4>4  Abijah ascended Mount Zemaraim, in the Ephraimite hill country, and said: "Listen to me, Jeroboam and all Israel! 
<bqverse 5>5  Don't you realize that the LORD God of Israel has given David and his dynasty lasting dominion over Israel by a formal agreement?<a name="fnB383" href="2ch_note.htm#fn383"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  Jeroboam son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon son of David, rose up and rebelled against his master. 
<bqverse 7>7  Lawless good-for-nothing men<a name="fnB384" href="2ch_note.htm#fn384"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> gathered around him and conspired<a name="fnB385" href="2ch_note.htm#fn385"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> against Rehoboam son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was an inexperienced young man<a name="fnB386" href="2ch_note.htm#fn386"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> and could not resist them. 
<bqverse 8>8  Now you are declaring that you will resist the LORD's rule through the Davidic dynasty.<a name="fnB387" href="2ch_note.htm#fn387"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> You have a huge army,<a name="fnB388" href="2ch_note.htm#fn388"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> and bring with you the gold calves that Jeroboam made for you as gods. 
<bqverse 9>9  But you banished<a name="fnB389" href="2ch_note.htm#fn389"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD's priests, Aaron's descendants, and the Levites, and appointed your own priests just as the surrounding nations do. Anyone who comes to consecrate himself with a young bull or seven rams becomes a priest of these fake gods.<a name="fnB390" href="2ch_note.htm#fn390"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  But as for us, the LORD is our God and we have not rejected him. Aaron's descendants serve as the LORD's priests and the Levites assist them with the work.<a name="fnB391" href="2ch_note.htm#fn391"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  They offer burnt sacrifices to the LORD every morning and every evening, along with fragrant incense. They arrange the ceremonial bread on a ritually clean table and light the lamps on the gold lampstand every evening. Certainly<a name="fnB392" href="2ch_note.htm#fn392"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> we are observing the LORD our God's regulations, but you have rejected him. 
<bqverse 12>12  Now look, God is with us as our leader. His priests are ready to blow the trumpets to signal the attack against you.<a name="fnB393" href="2ch_note.htm#fn393"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> You Israelites, don't fight against the LORD God of your ancestors,<a name="fnB394" href="2ch_note.htm#fn394"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> for you will not win!"<p>

<bqverse 13>13  Now Jeroboam had sent some men to ambush the Judahite army from behind.<a name="fnB395" href="2ch_note.htm#fn395"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> The main army was in front of the Judahite army;<a name="fnB396" href="2ch_note.htm#fn396"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> the ambushers were behind it. 
<bqverse 14>14  The men of Judah turned around and realized they were being attacked from the front and the rear.<a name="fnB397" href="2ch_note.htm#fn397"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> So they cried out for help to the LORD. The priests blew their trumpets, 
<bqverse 15>15  and the men of Judah gave<a name="fnB398" href="2ch_note.htm#fn398"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> the battle cry. As the men of Judah gave the battle cry, the LORD struck down Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. 
<bqverse 16>16  The Israelites fled from before the Judahite army,<a name="fnB399" href="2ch_note.htm#fn399"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> and God handed them over to the men of Judah.<a name="fnB400" href="2ch_note.htm#fn400"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  Abijah and his army thoroughly defeated them;<a name="fnB401" href="2ch_note.htm#fn401"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> five hundred thousand well-trained Israelite men fell dead.<a name="fnB402" href="2ch_note.htm#fn402"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  That day<a name="fnB403" href="2ch_note.htm#fn403"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> the Israelites were defeated; the men of Judah prevailed because they relied on the LORD God of their ancestors.<p>

<bqverse 19>19  Abijah chased Jeroboam; he seized from him these cities: Bethel and its surrounding towns, Jeshanah and its surrounding towns, and Ephron and its surrounding towns. 
<bqverse 20>20  Jeroboam did not regain power during the reign of Abijah.<a name="fnB404" href="2ch_note.htm#fn404"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> The LORD struck him down and he died.

<bqverse 5>5  He removed the high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah. The kingdom had rest under his rule.<a name="fnB416" href="2ch_note.htm#fn416"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 6>6  He built fortified cities throughout Judah, for the land was at rest and there was no war during those years; the LORD gave him peace. 
<bqverse 7>7  He said to the people of Judah:<a name="fnB417" href="2ch_note.htm#fn417"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> "Let's build these cities and fortify them with walls, towers, and strong gates.<a name="fnB418" href="2ch_note.htm#fn418"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> The land remains ours because we have followed<a name="fnB419" href="2ch_note.htm#fn419"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD our God and he has made us secure on all sides."<a name="fnB420" href="2ch_note.htm#fn420"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> So they built the cities<a name="fnB421" href="2ch_note.htm#fn421"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> and prospered.<p>

<bqverse 8>8  Asa had an army of three hundred thousand men from Judah, equipped with large shields and spears. He also had two hundred eighty thousand men from Benjamin who carried small shields and were adept archers; they were all skilled warriors. 
<bqverse 9>9  Zerach the Cushite marched against them with an army of a million<a name="fnB422" href="2ch_note.htm#fn422"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> men and three hundred chariots. He arrived at Mareshah, 
<bqverse 10>10  and Asa went out to oppose him. They deployed for battle in the Valley of Zephathah near Mareshah. <p>

<bqverse 11>11  Asa prayed<a name="fnB423" href="2ch_note.htm#fn423"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> to the LORD his God: "O LORD, there is no one but you that can help the weak when they are vastly outnumbered.<a name="fnB424" href="2ch_note.htm#fn424"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> Help us, O LORD our God, for we rely on you and have marched on your behalf against this huge army.<a name="fnB425" href="2ch_note.htm#fn425"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> O LORD our God, don't let men prevail against you!"<a name="fnB426" href="2ch_note.htm#fn426"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  The LORD struck down the Cushites before Asa and Judah. The Cushites fled, 
<bqverse 13>13  and Asa and his army chased them as far as Gerar. The Cushites were wiped out;<a name="fnB427" href="2ch_note.htm#fn427"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> they were shattered before the LORD and his army.

<bqverse 14>14  They defeated all the cities surrounding Gerar, for the LORD caused them to panic.<a name="fnB429" href="2ch_note.htm#fn429"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> The men of Judah<a name="fnB430" href="2ch_note.htm#fn430"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> looted all the cities, for they contained a huge amount of goods.<a name="fnB431" href="2ch_note.htm#fn431"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  They also attacked the tents of the herdsmen in charge of the livestock.<a name="fnB432" href="2ch_note.htm#fn432"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> They carried off many sheep and camels and then returned to Jerusalem.<p>

<p><i>Asa's Failures</i>
<p>
<bqverse 19>19  There was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa's reign. 
<bqchapter 16><A NAME="16"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> In the thirty-sixth year of Asa's reign, King Baasha of Israel attacked Judah, and he established Ramah as a military outpost to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the land of King Asa of Judah.<a name="fnB460" href="2ch_note.htm#fn460"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  Asa took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the LORD's temple and of the royal palace and sent it to King Ben Hadad of Syria, ruler in Damascus, along with this message: 
<bqverse 3>3  "I want to make a treaty with you, like the one our fathers made.<a name="fnB461" href="2ch_note.htm#fn461"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> See, I have sent you silver and gold. Break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel, so he will retreat from my land."<a name="fnB462" href="2ch_note.htm#fn462"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  Ben Hadad accepted King Asa's offer and ordered his army commanders to attack the cities of Israel.<a name="fnB463" href="2ch_note.htm#fn463"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> They conquered<a name="fnB464" href="2ch_note.htm#fn464"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> Ijon, Dan, Abel-Maim,<a name="fnB465" href="2ch_note.htm#fn465"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> and all the storage cities of Naphtali. 
<bqverse 5>5  When Baasha heard the news, he stopped fortifying<a name="fnB466" href="2ch_note.htm#fn466"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> Ramah and abandoned the project.<a name="fnB467" href="2ch_note.htm#fn467"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  King Asa ordered all the men of Judah to carry away the stones and wood that Baasha had used to build Ramah.<a name="fnB468" href="2ch_note.htm#fn468"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> He used the materials to build up<a name="fnB469" href="2ch_note.htm#fn469"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> Geba and Mizpah.<p>

<bqverse 7>7  At that time Hanani the prophet<a name="fnB470" href="2ch_note.htm#fn470"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> visited King Asa of Judah and said to him: "Because you relied on the king of Syria and did not rely on the LORD your God, the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your hand. 
<bqverse 8>8  Did not the Cushites and Libyans have a huge army with chariots and a very large number of horsemen? But when you relied on the LORD, he handed them over to you! 
<bqverse 9>9  Certainly<a name="fnB471" href="2ch_note.htm#fn471"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD watches the whole earth carefully<a name="fnB472" href="2ch_note.htm#fn472"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> and is ready to strengthen those who are devoted to him.<a name="fnB473" href="2ch_note.htm#fn473"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> You have acted foolishly in this matter; from now on you will have war. 
<bqverse 10>10  Asa was so angry at the prophet, he put him in jail.<a name="fnB474" href="2ch_note.htm#fn474"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> Asa also oppressed some of the people at that time.<a name="_Toc494012144"></a></p>

<bqverse 12>12  In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa developed a foot ailment.<a name="fnB476" href="2ch_note.htm#fn476"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> Though his ailment was severe, he did not seek the LORD, but only the doctors.<a name="fnB477" href="2ch_note.htm#fn477"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  Asa passed away<a name="fnB478" href="2ch_note.htm#fn478"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> in the forty-first year of his reign.

<bqverse 6>6  He was committed to following the LORD;<a name="fnB490" href="2ch_note.htm#fn490"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> he even removed the high places and Asherah poles from Judah.<p>

<bqverse 7>7  In the third year of his reign he sent his officials Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah to teach in the cities of Judah. 
<bqverse 8>8  They were accompanied by the Levites Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-Adonijah, and by the priests Elishama and Jehoram. 
<bqverse 9>9  They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the scroll of the law of the LORD. They traveled to all the cities of Judah and taught the people.<p>

<bqverse 10>10  The LORD put fear into all the kingdoms surrounding Judah;<a name="fnB491" href="2ch_note.htm#fn491"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> they did not make war with Jehoshaphat.

<bqverse 12>12  Jehoshaphat's power kept increasing. He built fortresses and storage cities throughout Judah.

<p><i>Jehoshaphat Allies with Ahab</i>

<bqverse 3>3  King Ahab of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Will you go with me to attack Ramoth Gilead?"

<bqverse 4>4  Then Jehoshaphat added,<a name="fnB499" href="2ch_note.htm#fn499"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> "Today seek an oracle from the LORD."<a name="fnB500" href="2ch_note.htm#fn500"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  So the king of Israel assembled four hundred prophets and asked them, "Should we attack Ramoth Gilead or not?"<a name="fnB501" href="2ch_note.htm#fn501"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> They said, "Attack!

<bqverse 6>6  But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there not a prophet of the LORD still here, that we may ask him?" 
<bqverse 7>7  The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, "There is still one man through whom we can seek the LORD's will.<a name="fnB503" href="2ch_note.htm#fn503"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> But I despise<a name="fnB504" href="2ch_note.htm#fn504"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> him because he does not prophesy prosperity for me, but always<a name="fnB505" href="2ch_note.htm#fn505"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> disaster.

<bqverse 8>8  The king of Israel summoned an officer and said, "Quickly bring Micaiah son of Imlah."<p>

<bqverse 9>9  Now the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah were sitting on their respective thrones, dressed in their robes, at the threshing floor near<a name="fnB507" href="2ch_note.htm#fn507"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> the entrance of the gate of Samaria.

<bqverse 10>10  Zedekiah son of Kenaanah made iron horns and said, "This is what the LORD says, `With these you will gore Syria until they are destroyed!'" 
<bqverse 11>11  All the prophets were prophesying the same, saying, "Attack Ramoth Gilead! You will succeed; the LORD will hand it over to the king!" 
<bqverse 12>12  Now the messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, "Look, the prophets are in complete agreement that the king will succeed.<a name="fnB508" href="2ch_note.htm#fn508"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> Your words must agree with theirs; you must predict success."<a name="fnB509" href="2ch_note.htm#fn509"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a>

He answered him, "Attack! You will succeed; they will be handed over to you."<a name="fnB511" href="2ch_note.htm#fn511"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  The king said to him, "How many times must I make you solemnly promise in<a name="fnB512" href="2ch_note.htm#fn512"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> the name of the LORD to tell me only the truth?" 
<bqverse 16>16  Micaiah<a name="fnB513" href="2ch_note.htm#fn513"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> replied, "I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains like sheep that have no shepherd. Then the LORD said, `They have no master. They should go home in peace.'" 
<bqverse 17>17  The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you he does not prophesy prosperity for me, but disaster?" 
<bqverse 18>18  Micaiah<a name="fnB514" href="2ch_note.htm#fn514"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> said, "That being the case, hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, with all the heavenly assembly standing on his right and on his left. 
<bqverse 19>19  The LORD said, `Who will deceive King Ahab of Israel, so he will attack Ramoth Gilead and die there?' One said this and another that. 
<bqverse 20>20  Then a spirit<a name="fnB515" href="2ch_note.htm#fn515"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> stepped forward and stood before the LORD. He said, `I will deceive him.' The LORD asked him, `How?' 
<bqverse 21>21  He replied, `I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.' The LORD<a name="fnB516" href="2ch_note.htm#fn516"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> said, `Deceive and overpower him.<a name="fnB517" href="2ch_note.htm#fn517"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> Go out and do as you have proposed.' 
<bqverse 22>22  So now, look, the LORD has placed a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours; but the LORD has decreed disaster for you." 
<bqverse 23>23  Zedekiah son of Kenaanah approached, hit Micaiah on the jaw, and said, "Which way did the LORD's spirit go when he went from me to speak to you?" 
<bqverse 24>24  Micaiah replied, "Look, you will see in the day when you go into an inner room to hide." 
<bqverse 25>25  Then the king of Israel said, "Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the city official and Joash the king's son. 
<bqverse 26>26  Say, `This is what the king says: "Put this man in prison. Give him only a little bread and water<a name="fnB518" href="2ch_note.htm#fn518"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> until I return safely."'" 
<bqverse 27>27  Micaiah said, "If you really do return safely, then the LORD has not spoken through me!" Then he added, "Take note,<a name="fnB519" href="2ch_note.htm#fn519"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> all you people."<p>

<bqverse 28>28  The king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah attacked Ramoth Gilead. 
<bqverse 29>29  The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and then enter<a name="fnB520" href="2ch_note.htm#fn520"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> the battle; but you wear your royal attire." So the king of Israel disguised himself and they entered the battle. 
<bqverse 30>30  Now the king of Syria had ordered his chariot commanders, "Do not fight common soldiers or high ranking officers;<a name="fnB521" href="2ch_note.htm#fn521"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> fight only the king of Israel." 
<bqverse 31>31  When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, "He must be the king of Israel." So they turned and attacked him, but Jehoshaphat cried out. The LORD helped him; God lured them away from him. 
<bqverse 32>32  When the chariot commanders realized he was not the king of Israel, they turned away from him. 
<bqverse 33>33  Now an archer shot an arrow at random<a name="fnB522" href="2ch_note.htm#fn522"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> and it struck the king of Israel between the plates of his armor. The king<a name="fnB523" href="2ch_note.htm#fn523"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> ordered his charioteer, "Turn around and take me from the battle line,<a name="fnB524" href="2ch_note.htm#fn524"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> for I am wounded." 
<bqverse 34>34  While the battle raged throughout the day, the king stood propped up in his chariot opposite the Syrians. He died in the evening as the sun was setting.<p>

<bqverse 5>5  Jehoshaphat stood before the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem at the LORD's temple, in front of the new courtyard. 
<bqverse 6>6  He prayed: "O LORD God of our ancestors,<a name="fnB553" href="2ch_note.htm#fn553"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> you are the God who lives in heaven<a name="fnB554" href="2ch_note.htm#fn554"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and rules over all the kingdoms of the nations.

<bqverse 19>19  Then some Levites, from the Kohathites and Korachites, got up and loudly praised the LORD God of Israel.<a name="fnB574" href="2ch_note.htm#fn574"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 20>20  Early the next morning they marched out to the Desert of Tekoa.

<bqverse 25>25  Jehoshaphat and his men<a name="fnB587" href="2ch_note.htm#fn587"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> went to gather the loot; they found a huge amount of supplies, clothing<a name="fnB588" href="2ch_note.htm#fn588"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> and valuable items. They carried away everything they could.<a name="fnB589" href="2ch_note.htm#fn589"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> There was so much loot, it took them three days to haul it off.<a name="fnB590" href="2ch_note.htm#fn590"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 26>26  On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berachah, where<a name="fnB591" href="2ch_note.htm#fn591"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> they praised the LORD.

<bqverse 27>27  Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned joyfully to Jerusalem with Jehoshaphat leading them; the LORD had given them reason to rejoice over their enemies. 
<bqverse 28>28  They entered Jerusalem to the sound of stringed instruments and trumpets and proceeded to the temple of the LORD. 
<bqverse 29>29  All the kingdoms of the surrounding lands were afraid of God<a name="fnB593" href="2ch_note.htm#fn593"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> when they heard how the LORD had fought against Israel's enemies.

<p><i>Jehoshaphat's Reign Ends</i>

<bqverse 31>31  Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king and he reigned for twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilchi. 
<bqverse 32>32  He followed in his father Asa's footsteps and was careful to do what the LORD approved.<a name="fnB595" href="2ch_note.htm#fn595"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 33>33  However, the high places were not eliminated; the people were still not devoted to the God of their ancestors.<a name="fnB596" href="2ch_note.htm#fn596"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 34>34  The rest of the events of Jehoshaphat's reign, from start to finish, are recorded in the Annals of Jehu son of Hanani which are included in Scroll of the Kings of Israel.<a name="fnB597" href="2ch_note.htm#fn597"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 35>35  Later King Jehoshaphat of Judah made an alliance with King Ahaziah of Israel, who<a name="fnB598" href="2ch_note.htm#fn598"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> did evil. 
<bqverse 36>36  They agreed<a name="fnB599" href="2ch_note.htm#fn599"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> to make ships to travel to Tarshish; they built the ships in Ezion Geber. 
<bqverse 37>37  Eliezer son of Dodavahu from Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, "Because<a name="fnB600" href="2ch_note.htm#fn600"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> you made an alliance with Ahaziah, the LORD will shatter what you have made."

<bqverse 5>5  Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 6>6  He followed in the footsteps of the kings of Israel, just as Ahab's dynasty had done, for he married Ahab's daughter.<a name="fnB607" href="2ch_note.htm#fn607"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> He did evil before<a name="fnB608" href="2ch_note.htm#fn608"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD. 
<bqverse 7>7  But the LORD was unwilling to destroy David's dynasty<a name="fnB609" href="2ch_note.htm#fn609"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> because of the promise<a name="fnB610" href="2ch_note.htm#fn610"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> he had made to give David a perpetual dynasty.<a name="fnB611" href="2ch_note.htm#fn611"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 8>8  During Jehoram's<a name="fnB612" href="2ch_note.htm#fn612"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> reign Edom freed themselves from Judah's control and set up their own king.<a name="fnB613" href="2ch_note.htm#fn613"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  Jehoram crossed over to Zair with his officers and all his chariots. The Edomites, who had surrounded him, attacked at night and defeated him and his chariot officers.<a name="fnB614" href="2ch_note.htm#fn614"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  So Edom has remained free from Judah's control to this very day.<a name="fnB615" href="2ch_note.htm#fn615"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> At that same time Libnah also rebelled and freed themselves from Judah's control<a name="fnB616" href="2ch_note.htm#fn616"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> because Jehoram<a name="fnB617" href="2ch_note.htm#fn617"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> rejected the LORD God of his ancestors. 
<bqverse 11>11  He also built high places on the hills of Judah; he encouraged the residents of Jerusalem to be unfaithful to the LORD<a name="fnB618" href="2ch_note.htm#fn618"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and led Judah away from the LORD.<a name="fnB619" href="2ch_note.htm#fn619"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 12>12  Jehoram<a name="fnB620" href="2ch_note.htm#fn620"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> received this letter from Elijah the prophet: "This is what the LORD God of your ancestor David says: `You<a name="fnB621" href="2ch_note.htm#fn621"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> have not followed in the footsteps<a name="fnB622" href="2ch_note.htm#fn622"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> of your father Jehoshaphat and of<a name="fnB623" href="2ch_note.htm#fn623"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> King Asa of Judah, 
<bqverse 13>13  but have instead followed in the footsteps of the kings of Israel.

<bqverse 14>14  So look, the LORD is about to severely afflict<a name="fnB626" href="2ch_note.htm#fn626"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> your people, your sons, your wives, and all you own. 
<bqverse 15>15  And you will get a serious, chronic intestinal disease which will cause your intestines to swell."<a name="fnB627" href="2ch_note.htm#fn627"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 16>16  The LORD stirred up against Jehoram the Philistines<a name="fnB628" href="2ch_note.htm#fn628"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> and the Arabs who lived beside the Cushites. 
<bqverse 17>17  They attacked Judah and swept through it.<a name="fnB629" href="2ch_note.htm#fn629"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> They carried off everything they found in the royal palace,<a name="fnB630" href="2ch_note.htm#fn630"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> including his sons and wives. None of his sons was left, except for his youngest, Ahaziah. 
<bqverse 18>18  After all this happened, the LORD afflicted him with an incurable intestinal disease.<a name="fnB631" href="2ch_note.htm#fn631"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  After about two years his intestines were so swollen from the disease that he died a very painful death.<a name="fnB632" href="2ch_note.htm#fn632"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> His people did not make a bonfire to honor him, as they had done for his ancestors.<a name="fnB633" href="2ch_note.htm#fn633"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 20>20  Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. No one regretted his death;<a name="fnB634" href="2ch_note.htm#fn634"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> he was buried in the City of David,<a name="fnB635" href="2ch_note.htm#fn635"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> but not in the royal tombs.

<p><i>Ahaziah's Reign</i>
<p><A NAME="22"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> The residents of Jerusalem made his youngest son Ahaziah king in his place, for the raiding party that invaded the city with the Arabs had killed all the older sons.<a name="fnB636" href="2ch_note.htm#fn636"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> So Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah. 
<bqverse 2>2 Ahaziah was twenty-two<a name="fnB637" href="2ch_note.htm#fn637"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> years old when he became king and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. His mother was Athaliah, the granddaughter<a name="fnB638" href="2ch_note.htm#fn638"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> of Omri. 
<bqverse 3>3  He followed in the footsteps of Ahab's dynasty,<a name="fnB639" href="2ch_note.htm#fn639"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> for his mother gave him evil advice.<a name="fnB640" href="2ch_note.htm#fn640"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  He did evil before the LORD like Ahab's dynasty because, after his father's death, they<a name="fnB641" href="2ch_note.htm#fn641"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> gave him advice that led to his destruction. 
<bqverse 5>5  He followed their advice and joined Ahab's son King Joram<a name="fnB642" href="2ch_note.htm#fn642"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> of Israel, in a battle against King Hazael of Syria<a name="fnB643" href="2ch_note.htm#fn643"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> at Ramoth Gilead in which the Syrians defeated Joram. 
<bqverse 6>6  Joram<a name="fnB644" href="2ch_note.htm#fn644"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he received from the Syrians<a name="fnB645" href="2ch_note.htm#fn645"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> in Ramah when he fought against King Hazael of Syria. Ahaziah<a name="fnB646" href="2ch_note.htm#fn646"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> son of King Jehoram of Judah went down to visit Joram son of Ahab in Jezreel, for he was ill.<p>

<bqverse 7>7  God brought about Ahaziah's downfall through his visit to Joram.<a name="fnB647" href="2ch_note.htm#fn647"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> When Ahaziah<a name="fnB648" href="2ch_note.htm#fn648"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> arrived, he went out with Joram to meet Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had commissioned<a name="fnB649" href="2ch_note.htm#fn649"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> to wipe out Ahab's family.<a name="fnB650" href="2ch_note.htm#fn650"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  While Jehu was dishing out punishment to Ahab's family, he discovered the officials of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's relatives who were serving Ahaziah and killed them. 
<bqverse 9>9  He looked for Ahaziah, who was captured while hiding in Samaria. They brought him to Jehu and then executed him. They did give him a burial, for they reasoned,<a name="fnB651" href="2ch_note.htm#fn651"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> "He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with his whole heart."

<p><i>Athaliah is Eliminated</i>
<p>
<bqverse 10>10  When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she was determined to destroy the entire royal line<a name="fnB653" href="2ch_note.htm#fn653"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> of Judah.<a name="fnB654" href="2ch_note.htm#fn654"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  So Jehoshabeath,<a name="fnB655" href="2ch_note.htm#fn655"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> the daughter of King Jehoram,<a name="fnB656" href="2ch_note.htm#fn656"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> took Ahaziah's son Joash and sneaked him away<a name="fnB657" href="2ch_note.htm#fn657"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> from the rest of the royal descendants who were to be executed. She hid him and his nurse in the room where the bedcovers were stored. So Jehoshabeath the daughter of King Jehoram, wife of Jehoiada the priest and sister of Ahaziah, hid him from Athaliah so she could not execute him. 
<bqverse 12>12  He hid out in God's temple<a name="fnB658" href="2ch_note.htm#fn658"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> for six years, while Athaliah was ruling over the land.<p>

<bqchapter 23><A NAME="23"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> In the seventh year Jehoiada made a bold move. He made a pact<a name="fnB659" href="2ch_note.htm#fn659"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> with the officers of the units of hundreds: Azariah son of Jehoram, Ishmael son of Jehochanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri. 
<bqverse 2>2  They traveled throughout Judah and assembled the Levites from all the cities of Judah, as well as the Israelite family leaders.<p>
They came to Jerusalem, 
<bqverse 3>3  and the whole assembly made a covenant with the king in the temple of God. Jehoiada<a name="fnB660" href="2ch_note.htm#fn660"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> said to them, "The king's son will rule, just as the LORD promised David's descendants. 
<bqverse 4>4  This is what you must do. One third of you priests and Levites who are on duty during the Sabbath will guard the doors. 
<bqverse 5>5  Another third of you will be stationed at the royal palace and still another third at the Foundation Gate. All the others<a name="fnB661" href="2ch_note.htm#fn661"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> will stand in the courtyards of the LORD's temple. 
<bqverse 6>6  No one must enter the LORD's temple except the priests and Levites who are on duty. They may enter because they are ritually pure. All the others should carry out their assigned service to the LORD. 
<bqverse 7>7  The Levites must surround the king. Each of you must hold his weapon in his hand. Whoever tries to enter the temple<a name="fnB662" href="2ch_note.htm#fn662"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> must be killed. You must accompany the king wherever he goes."<a name="fnB663" href="2ch_note.htm#fn663"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 8>8  The Levites and all the men of Judah<a name="fnB664" href="2ch_note.htm#fn664"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each of them took his men, those who were on duty during the Sabbath as well as those who were off duty on the Sabbath. Jehoiada the priest did not release his divisions from their duties. 
<bqverse 9>9  Jehoiada the priest gave to the officers of the units of hundreds King David's spears and shields<a name="fnB665" href="2ch_note.htm#fn665"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> that were kept in God's temple. 
<bqverse 10>10  He placed the men at their posts, each holding his weapon in his hand. They lined up from the south side of the temple to the north side and stood near the altar and the temple, surrounding the king.<a name="fnB666" href="2ch_note.htm#fn666"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  Jehoiada and his sons led out the king's son and placed on him the crown and the royal insignia.<a name="fnB667" href="2ch_note.htm#fn667"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> They proclaimed him king and poured oil on his head.<a name="fnB668" href="2ch_note.htm#fn668"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> They declared, "Long live the king!"<p>

<bqverse 12>12  When Athaliah heard the royal guard<a name="fnB669" href="2ch_note.htm#fn669"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> shouting and praising the king, she joined the crowd<a name="fnB670" href="2ch_note.htm#fn670"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> at the LORD's temple. 
<bqverse 13>13  Then she saw<a name="fnB671" href="2ch_note.htm#fn671"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> the king standing by his pillar at the entrance. The officers and trumpeters stood beside the king and all the people of the land were celebrating and blowing trumpets, and the musicians with various instruments were leading the celebration. Athaliah tore her clothes and yelled, "Treason! Treason!"<a name="fnB672" href="2ch_note.htm#fn672"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  Jehoiada the priest sent out the officers of the units of hundreds, who were in charge of the army, and ordered them, "Bring her outside the temple to the guards.<a name="fnB673" href="2ch_note.htm#fn673"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> Put the sword to anyone who follows her." The priest gave this order because he had decided she should not be executed in the LORD's temple.<a name="fnB674" href="2ch_note.htm#fn674"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  They seized her and took her into the precincts of the royal palace through the horses' entrance.<a name="fnB675" href="2ch_note.htm#fn675"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> There they executed her.<p>

<bqverse 16>16  Jehoiada then drew up a covenant stipulating that he, all the people, and the king should be loyal to the LORD.<a name="fnB676" href="2ch_note.htm#fn676"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  All the people went and demolished<a name="fnB677" href="2ch_note.htm#fn677"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> the temple of Baal. They smashed its altars and idols.<a name="fnB678" href="2ch_note.htm#fn678"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> They killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars. 
<bqverse 18>18  Jehoiada then assigned the duties of the LORD's temple to the priests, the Levites whom David had assigned to the LORD's temple. They were responsible for offering burnt sacrifices to the LORD with joy and music, according to<a name="fnB679" href="2ch_note.htm#fn679"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> the law of Moses and the edict of David. 
<bqverse 19>19  He posted guards at the gates of the LORD's temple, so no one who was ritually unclean in any way could enter. 
<bqverse 20>20 He summoned<a name="fnB680" href="2ch_note.htm#fn680"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> the officers of the units of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people, and all the people of land, and he then led the king down from the LORD's temple. They entered the royal palace through the Upper Gate and seated the king on the royal throne. 
<bqverse 21>21  All the people of the land celebrated, for the city had rest now that they had killed Athaliah.<a name="fnB681" href="2ch_note.htm#fn681"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqchapter 24>

<p><i>Joash's Reign</i>
<p><A NAME="24"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Joash was seven years old when he began to reign. He reigned for forty years in Jerusalem. His mother was Zibiah, who was from Beer Sheba. 
<bqverse 2>2  Joash did what the LORD approved<a name="fnB682" href="2ch_note.htm#fn682"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> throughout the lifetime<a name="fnB683" href="2ch_note.htm#fn683"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> of Jehoiada the priest. 
<bqverse 3>3  Jehoiada chose two wives for him who gave him sons and daughters. <p>

<bqverse 4>4  Joash was determined to repair the LORD's temple.<a name="fnB684" href="2ch_note.htm#fn684"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  He assembled the priests and Levites and ordered them, "Go out to the cities of Judah and collect the annual quota of silver from all Israel for repairs on the temple of your God. Be quick about it!" But the Levites delayed. <p>

<bqverse 6>6  So the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest,<a name="fnB685" href="2ch_note.htm#fn685"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> and said to him, "Why have you not made<a name="fnB686" href="2ch_note.htm#fn686"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> the Levites collect<a name="fnB687" href="2ch_note.htm#fn687"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> from Judah and Jerusalem the tax authorized by Moses the LORD's servant and by the assembly of Israel at the tent containing the tablets of the law?"<a name="fnB688" href="2ch_note.htm#fn688"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  (Wicked Athaliah and her sons had broken into God's temple and used all the holy items of the LORD's temple in their worship of the Baals.) 
<bqverse 8>8  The king ordered a chest to be made and placed outside the gate of the LORD's temple.<a name="fnB689" href="2ch_note.htm#fn689"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  An edict was sent throughout Judah and Jerusalem requiring the people to bring to the LORD the tax that Moses, God's servant, imposed on Israel in the wilderness.<a name="fnB690" href="2ch_note.htm#fn690"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  All the officials and all the people gladly brought their silver and threw it into the chest until it was full. 
<bqverse 11>11  Whenever the Levites brought the chest to the royal accountant and they saw there was a lot of silver, the royal scribe and the accountant of the high priest emptied the chest and then took it back to its place. They went through this routine every day and collected a large amount of silver. <p>

<bqverse 12>12  The king and Jehoiada gave it to the construction foremen<a name="fnB691" href="2ch_note.htm#fn691"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> assigned to the LORD's temple. They hired carpenters and craftsmen to repair the LORD's temple, as well as those skilled in working with iron and bronze to restore the LORD's temple. 
<bqverse 13>13  They worked hard and made the repairs.<a name="fnB692" href="2ch_note.htm#fn692"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> They followed the measurements specified for God's temple and restored it.<a name="fnB693" href="2ch_note.htm#fn693"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  When they were finished, they brought the rest of the silver to the king and Jehoiada. They used it to make items for the LORD's temple, including items used in the temple service and for burnt sacrifices, pans, and various other gold and silver items. Throughout Jehoiada's lifetime, burnt sacrifices were offered regularly in the LORD's temple. <p>

<bqverse 15>15  Jehoiada grew old and died at the age of one hundred and thirty.<a name="fnB694" href="2ch_note.htm#fn694"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  He was buried in the City of David<a name="fnB695" href="2ch_note.htm#fn695"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> with the kings, because he had accomplished good in Israel and for God and his temple.<p>

<bqverse 17>17  After Jehoiada died, the officials of Judah visited the king and declared their loyalty to him.<a name="fnB696" href="2ch_note.htm#fn696"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> The king listened to their advice.<a name="fnB697" href="2ch_note.htm#fn697"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  They abandoned the temple of the LORD God of their ancestors,<a name="fnB698" href="2ch_note.htm#fn698"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> and worshiped<a name="fnB699" href="2ch_note.htm#fn699"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> the Asherah poles and idols. Because of this sinful activity, God was angry with Judah and Jerusalem.<a name="fnB700" href="2ch_note.htm#fn700"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  The LORD sent prophets among them to lead them back to him.<a name="fnB701" href="2ch_note.htm#fn701"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> They warned<a name="fnB702" href="2ch_note.htm#fn702"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> the people, but they would not pay attention. 
<bqverse 20>20  God's Spirit energized<a name="fnB703" href="2ch_note.htm#fn703"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood up before the people and said to them, "This is what God says: `Why are you violating the commands of the LORD? You will not be prosperous. Because you have rejected the LORD, he has rejected you!'" 
<bqverse 21>21  They plotted against him and by royal decree stoned him to death in the courtyard of the LORD's temple. 
<bqverse 22>22  King Joash disregarded<a name="fnB704" href="2ch_note.htm#fn704"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> the loyalty his father Jehoiada had shown him and killed Jehoiada's<a name="fnB705" href="2ch_note.htm#fn705"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> son. As Zechariah<a name="fnB706" href="2ch_note.htm#fn706"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> was dying, he said, "May the LORD take notice and seek vengeance!"<a name="fnB707" href="2ch_note.htm#fn707"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 23>23  At the beginning<a name="fnB708" href="2ch_note.htm#fn708"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> of the year the Syrian army attacked<a name="fnB709" href="2ch_note.htm#fn709"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> Joash<a name="fnB710" href="2ch_note.htm#fn710"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> and invaded Judah and Jerusalem. They wiped out all the leaders of the people and sent all the loot they gathered to the king of Damascus. 
<bqverse 24>24  Even though the invading Syrian army was relatively weak, the LORD handed over to them Judah's very large army,<a name="fnB711" href="2ch_note.htm#fn711"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> for the people of Judah<a name="fnB712" href="2ch_note.htm#fn712"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> had abandoned the LORD God of their ancestors. The Syrians<a name="fnB713" href="2ch_note.htm#fn713"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> gave Joash what he deserved.<a name="fnB714" href="2ch_note.htm#fn714"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  When they withdrew, they left Joash<a name="fnB715" href="2ch_note.htm#fn715"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> badly wounded.

Thus<a name="fnB718" href="2ch_note.htm#fn718"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> he died and was buried in the City of David,<a name="fnB719" href="2ch_note.htm#fn719"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> but not in the tombs of the kings. 
<bqverse 26>26  The conspirators were Zabad son of Shimeath (an Ammonite woman) and Jehozabad son of Shimrith (a Moabite woman).<p>

<bqverse 27>27  The list of his sons, the many prophetic oracles pertaining to him, and the account of his building project on God's temple are included in the record of the Scroll of the Kings.<a name="fnB720" href="2ch_note.htm#fn720"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> His son Amaziah replaced him as king.

<p><i>Amaziah's Reign</i>
<p><A NAME="25"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jehoaddan, who was from Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 2>2  He did what the LORD approved,<a name="fnB721" href="2ch_note.htm#fn721"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> but not with wholehearted devotion.<a name="fnB722" href="2ch_note.htm#fn722"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 3>3  When he had secured control of the kingdom,<a name="fnB723" href="2ch_note.htm#fn723"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> he executed the servants who had assassinated his father.<a name="fnB724" href="2ch_note.htm#fn724"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  However, he did not execute their sons. He obeyed the LORD's commandment as recorded in the law scroll of Moses,<a name="fnB725" href="2ch_note.htm#fn725"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> "Fathers must not be executed for their sons' crimes,<a name="fnB726" href="2ch_note.htm#fn726"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> and sons must not be executed for their fathers' crimes.<a name="fnB727" href="2ch_note.htm#fn727"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> A man must be executed only for his own crime."<a name="fnB728" href="2ch_note.htm#fn728"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 5>5  Amaziah assembled the people of Judah<a name="fnB729" href="2ch_note.htm#fn729"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> and assigned them by families to the commanders of units of a thousand and the commanders of units of a hundred for all Judah and Benjamin. He counted those twenty years of age and up and discovered there were three hundred thousand young men of fighting age<a name="fnB730" href="2ch_note.htm#fn730"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> equipped with spears and shields.<a name="fnB731" href="2ch_note.htm#fn731"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  He hired one hundred thousand Israelite warriors for a hundred units<a name="fnB732" href="2ch_note.htm#fn732"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> of silver.<p>

<bqverse 7>7  But a prophet<a name="fnB733" href="2ch_note.htm#fn733"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> visited him and said: "O king, the Israelite troops must not go with you, for the LORD is not with Israel or any of the Ephraimites.<a name="fnB734" href="2ch_note.htm#fn734"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  Even if you go and fight bravely in battle, God will defeat you<a name="fnB735" href="2ch_note.htm#fn735"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> before the enemy. God is capable of helping or defeating."<a name="fnB736" href="2ch_note.htm#fn736"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  Amaziah asked the prophet:<a name="fnB737" href="2ch_note.htm#fn737"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> "But what should I do about the hundred units<a name="fnB738" href="2ch_note.htm#fn738"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> of silver I paid the Israelite troops?" The prophet<a name="fnB739" href="2ch_note.htm#fn739"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> replied, "The LORD is capable of giving you more than that." 
<bqverse 10>10  So Amaziah dismissed the troops that had come to him from Ephraim and sent them home.<a name="fnB740" href="2ch_note.htm#fn740"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> They were very angry at Judah and returned home incensed. 
<bqverse 11>11  Amaziah boldly led his army to the Valley of Salt,<a name="fnB741" href="2ch_note.htm#fn741"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> where he defeated<a name="fnB742" href="2ch_note.htm#fn742"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> ten thousand Edomites.<a name="fnB743" href="2ch_note.htm#fn743"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  The men<a name="fnB744" href="2ch_note.htm#fn744"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> of Judah captured ten thousand men alive. They took them to the top of a cliff and threw them over.<a name="fnB745" href="2ch_note.htm#fn745"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> All the captives<a name="fnB746" href="2ch_note.htm#fn746"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> fell to their death.<a name="fnB747" href="2ch_note.htm#fn747"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 13>13  Now the troops Amaziah had dismissed and not allowed to fight in the battle<a name="fnB748" href="2ch_note.htm#fn748"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a><b> </b>raided<a name="fnB749" href="2ch_note.htm#fn749"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon. They killed<a name="fnB750" href="2ch_note.htm#fn750"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> three thousand people and carried off a large amount of loot.<p>

<bqverse 14>14  When Amaziah returned from defeating the Edomites, he brought back the gods of the people<a name="fnB751" href="2ch_note.htm#fn751"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> of Seir and made them his personal gods.<a name="fnB752" href="2ch_note.htm#fn752"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> He bowed down before them and offered them sacrifices. 
<bqverse 15>15  The LORD was angry at Amaziah and sent a prophet to him, who said, "Why are you following<a name="fnB753" href="2ch_note.htm#fn753"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> these gods<a name="fnB754" href="2ch_note.htm#fn754"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> that could not deliver their own people from your power?"<a name="fnB755" href="2ch_note.htm#fn755"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  While he was speaking, Amaziah<a name="fnB756" href="2ch_note.htm#fn756"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> said to him, "Did we appoint you to be a royal counselor? Stop prophesying or else you will be killed!"<a name="fnB757" href="2ch_note.htm#fn757"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> So the prophet stopped, but added, "I know that the LORD has decided<a name="fnB758" href="2ch_note.htm#fn758"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> to destroy you, because you have done this thing and refused to listen to my advice."<p>

<bqverse 17>17  After King Amaziah of Judah consulted with his advisers,<a name="fnB759" href="2ch_note.htm#fn759"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> he sent this message to the king of Israel, Joash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, "Come on, face me on the battlefield."<a name="fnB760" href="2ch_note.htm#fn760"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  King Joash of Israel sent this message back to King Amaziah of Judah, "A thorn bush in Lebanon sent this message to a cedar in Lebanon, `Give your daughter to my son as a wife.' Then a wild animal of Lebanon came by and trampled down the thorn bush.<a name="fnB761" href="2ch_note.htm#fn761"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  You defeated Edom<a name="fnB762" href="2ch_note.htm#fn762"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> and it has gone to your head.<a name="fnB763" href="2ch_note.htm#fn763"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> Stay in your palace. Why bring calamity on yourself? Why bring down yourself and Judah along with you?"<a name="fnB764" href="2ch_note.htm#fn764"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 20>20  But Amaziah did not heed the warning,<a name="fnB765" href="2ch_note.htm#fn765"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> for God wanted to hand them over to Joash because they followed the gods of Edom.<a name="fnB766" href="2ch_note.htm#fn766"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  So King Joash of Israel attacked. He and King Amaziah of Judah faced each other on the battlefield<a name="fnB767" href="2ch_note.htm#fn767"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> in Beth Shemesh of Judah. 
<bqverse 22>22 Judah was defeated by Israel, and each man ran back home.<a name="fnB768" href="2ch_note.htm#fn768"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23  King Joash of Israel captured King Amaziah of Judah, son of Joash son of Jehoahaz, in Beth Shemesh and brought him to Jerusalem. He broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate--a distance of about six hundred feet.<a name="fnB769" href="2ch_note.htm#fn769"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  He took away all the gold and silver, all the items found in God's temple that were under the watch of Obed-Edom, the riches in the royal palace, and some hostages. Then he went back to Samaria.<p>

<bqverse 25>25  King Amaziah son of Joash of Judah, lived for fifteen years after the death of King Joash son of Jehoahaz of Israel. 
<bqverse 26>26  The rest of the events of Amaziah's reign, from start to finish, are recorded in the Scroll of the Kings of Judah and Israel.<a name="fnB770" href="2ch_note.htm#fn770"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  From the time Amaziah turned from following the LORD, conspirators plotted against him in Jerusalem.<a name="fnB771" href="2ch_note.htm#fn771"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> He fled to Lachish, but they sent assassins after him<a name="fnB772" href="2ch_note.htm#fn772"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> and they killed him there. 
<bqverse 28>28  His corpse was carried back by horses,<a name="fnB773" href="2ch_note.htm#fn773"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> and he was buried in Jerusalem with his ancestors<a name="fnB774" href="2ch_note.htm#fn774"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> in the City of David.<a name="fnB775" href="2ch_note.htm#fn775"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Uzziah's Reign</i>
<p><A NAME="26"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> All the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in his father Amaziah's place. 
<bqverse 2>2  Uzziah<a name="fnB776" href="2ch_note.htm#fn776"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> built up Elath and restored it to Judah after King Amaziah<a name="fnB777" href="2ch_note.htm#fn777"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> had passed away.<a name="fnB778" href="2ch_note.htm#fn778"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 3>3  Uzziah was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jecholiah, who was from Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 4>4  He did what the LORD approved, just as his father Amaziah had done.<a name="fnB779" href="2ch_note.htm#fn779"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  He followed<a name="fnB780" href="2ch_note.htm#fn780"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> God during the lifetime of<a name="fnB781" href="2ch_note.htm#fn781"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> Zechariah, who taught him how to honor God. As long as he followed<a name="fnB782" href="2ch_note.htm#fn782"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD, God caused him to succeed.<a name="fnB783" href="2ch_note.htm#fn783"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 6>6  Uzziah attacked<a name="fnB784" href="2ch_note.htm#fn784"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> the Philistines and broke down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod. He built cities in the region of Ashdod and throughout Philistine territory.<a name="fnB785" href="2ch_note.htm#fn785"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  God helped him in his campaigns<a name="fnB786" href="2ch_note.htm#fn786"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> against the Philistines, the Arabs living in Gur Baal, and the Meunites. 
<bqverse 8>8  The Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziah and his fame reached<a name="fnB787" href="2ch_note.htm#fn787"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> the border of Egypt, for he grew in power.<p>

<bqverse 9>9  Uzziah built and fortified towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, Valley Gate, and at the "Angle."<a name="fnB788" href="2ch_note.htm#fn788"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  He built towers in the desert and dug many cisterns, for he owned many herds in the lowlands<a name="fnB789" href="2ch_note.htm#fn789"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> and the plain. He had workers in the fields and vineyards in the hills and in Carmel,<a name="fnB790" href="2ch_note.htm#fn790"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> for he loved agriculture.<a name="fnB791" href="2ch_note.htm#fn791"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 11>11  Uzziah had an army of skilled warriors trained for battle. They were organized by divisions according to the muster rolls made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer under the authority of Hananiah, a royal official. 
<bqverse 12>12  The total number of family leaders who led warriors was twenty-six hundred. 
<bqverse 13>13  They commanded an army of 307,500 skilled and able warriors who were ready to defend<a name="fnB792" href="2ch_note.htm#fn792"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> the king against his enemies. 
<bqverse 14>14  Uzziah supplied shields, spears, helmets, breastplates, bows, and slingstones for the entire army. 
<bqverse 15>15  In Jerusalem he made war machines carefully designed to shoot arrows and large stones from the towers and corners of the walls. He became very famous, for he received tremendous support and became powerful.<a name="fnB793" href="2ch_note.htm#fn793"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 16>16  But once he became powerful, his pride destroyed him.<a name="fnB794" href="2ch_note.htm#fn794"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> He disobeyed<a name="fnB795" href="2ch_note.htm#fn795"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD his God. He entered the LORD's temple to offer incense on the incense altar. 
<bqverse 17>17  Azariah the priest and eighty other brave priests of the LORD followed him in. 
<bqverse 18>18  They confronted<a name="fnB796" href="2ch_note.htm#fn796"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> King Uzziah and said to him, "It is not proper for you, Uzziah, to offer incense to the LORD. That is the responsibility of the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who are consecrated to offer incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have disobeyed<a name="fnB797" href="2ch_note.htm#fn797"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> and the LORD God will not honor you!" 
<bqverse 19>19  Uzziah, who had an incense censer in his hand, became angry. While he was yelling<a name="fnB798" href="2ch_note.htm#fn798"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> at the priests, a skin disease<a name="fnB799" href="2ch_note.htm#fn799"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> appeared on his forehead right there in front of the priests in the LORD's temple near the incense altar. 
<bqverse 20>20  When Azariah the high priest and the other priests looked at<a name="fnB800" href="2ch_note.htm#fn800"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> him, there was a skin disease on his forehead. They took him out of there; even the king<a name="fnB801" href="2ch_note.htm#fn801"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> himself was in a hurry to leave because the LORD had afflicted him. 
<bqverse 21>21  King Uzziah suffered from a skin disease until the day he died. He lived in separate quarters,<a name="fnB802" href="2ch_note.htm#fn802"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> afflicted by a skin disease and banned from the LORD's temple.

<p><i>Ahaz's Reign</i>
<p><A NAME="28"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what pleased the LORD, in contrast to his ancestor David.<a name="fnB820" href="2ch_note.htm#fn820"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  He followed in the footsteps of<a name="fnB821" href="2ch_note.htm#fn821"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> the kings of Israel; he also made images of the Baals. 
<bqverse 3>3  He offered sacrifices in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom and passed his sons through the fire,<a name="fnB822" href="2ch_note.htm#fn822"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> a horrible sin practiced by the nations<a name="fnB823" href="2ch_note.htm#fn823"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> whom the LORD drove out before the Israelites. 
<bqverse 4>4  He offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.<p>

<bqverse 5>5  The LORD his God handed him over to the king of Syria. The Syrians<a name="fnB824" href="2ch_note.htm#fn824"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> defeated him and deported many captives to Damascus.<a name="fnB825" href="2ch_note.htm#fn825"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> He was also handed over to the king of Israel, who thoroughly defeated him.<a name="fnB826" href="2ch_note.htm#fn826"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  In one day King Pekah son of Remaliah of Israel killed one hundred and twenty thousand warriors in Judah, because they had abandoned the LORD God of their ancestors.<a name="fnB827" href="2ch_note.htm#fn827"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  Zichri, an Ephraimite warrior, killed the king's son Maaseiah, Azrikam, the supervisor of the palace, and Elkanah, the king's second-in-command. 
<bqverse 8>8  The Israelites seized from their brothers two hundred thousand wives, sons, and daughters. They also carried off a huge amount of loot and took it<a name="fnB828" href="2ch_note.htm#fn828"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> back to Samaria.<p>

<bqverse 9>9  Oded, a prophet of the LORD, was there. He went to meet the army as they arrived in Samaria and said to them: "Look, because the LORD God of your ancestors was angry with Judah he handed them over to you. You have killed them so mercilessly that God has taken notice.<a name="fnB829" href="2ch_note.htm#fn829"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  And now you are planning<a name="fnB830" href="2ch_note.htm#fn830"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> to enslave<a name="fnB831" href="2ch_note.htm#fn831"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> the people<a name="fnB832" href="2ch_note.htm#fn832"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> of Judah and Jerusalem. Yet are you not also guilty before the LORD your God? 
<bqverse 11>11  Now listen to me! Send back those you have seized from your brothers, for the LORD is very angry at you!"<a name="fnB833" href="2ch_note.htm#fn833"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  So some of<a name="fnB834" href="2ch_note.htm#fn834"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> the Ephraimite family leaders, Azariah son of Jehochanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jechizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai confronted<a name="fnB835" href="2ch_note.htm#fn835"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> those returning from the battle. 
<bqverse 13>13  They said to them, "Don't bring those captives here! Are you planning on making us even more sinful and guilty before the LORD?<a name="fnB836" href="2ch_note.htm#fn836"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> Our guilt is already great and the LORD is very angry at Israel."<a name="fnB837" href="2ch_note.htm#fn837"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  So the soldiers released the captives and the loot before the officials and the entire assembly. 
<bqverse 15>15  Men were assigned to take the prisoners and find clothes among the loot for those who were naked.<a name="fnB838" href="2ch_note.htm#fn838"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> So they clothed them, supplied them with sandals, gave them food and drink, and provided them with oil to rub on their skin.<a name="fnB839" href="2ch_note.htm#fn839"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> They put the ones who couldn't walk on donkeys.<a name="fnB840" href="2ch_note.htm#fn840"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> They brought them back to their brothers at Jericho, the city of the date palm trees, and then returned to Samaria.<p>

<bqverse 16>16  At that time King Ahaz asked the king<a name="fnB841" href="2ch_note.htm#fn841"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> of Assyria for help. 
<bqverse 17>17  The Edomites had again invaded and defeated Judah and carried off captives. 
<bqverse 18>18  The Philistines had raided the cities of Judah in the lowlands<a name="fnB842" href="2ch_note.htm#fn842"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> and Negev. They captured and settled in Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Socho and its surrounding towns, Timnah and its surrounding towns, and Gimzo and its surrounding towns. 
<bqverse 19>19  The LORD humiliated<a name="fnB843" href="2ch_note.htm#fn843"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> Judah because of King Ahaz of Israel,<a name="fnB844" href="2ch_note.htm#fn844"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> for he encouraged Judah to sin and was very<a name="fnB845" href="2ch_note.htm#fn845"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> unfaithful to the LORD. 
<bqverse 20>20  King Tiglath-pileser<a name="fnB846" href="2ch_note.htm#fn846"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> of Assyria came, but he gave him more trouble than support.<a name="fnB847" href="2ch_note.htm#fn847"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  Ahaz gathered riches<a name="fnB848" href="2ch_note.htm#fn848"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> from the LORD's temple, the royal palace, and the officials and gave them to the king of Assyria, but that did not help.<p>

<bqverse 22>22  During his time of trouble King Ahaz was even more unfaithful to the LORD. 
<bqverse 23>23  He offered sacrifices to the gods of Damascus whom he thought had defeated him.<a name="fnB849" href="2ch_note.htm#fn849"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> He reasoned,<a name="fnB850" href="2ch_note.htm#fn850"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> "Since the gods of the kings of Damascus helped them, I will sacrifice to them so they will help me." But they caused him and all Israel to stumble. 
<bqverse 24>24  Ahaz gathered the items in God's temple and removed them. He shut the doors of the LORD's temple and erected altars on every street corner in Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 25>25  In every city throughout Judah he set up high places to offer sacrifices to other gods. He angered the LORD God of his ancestors.<p>

<bqverse 26>26  The rest of the events of Ahaz's reign, including his accomplishments from start to finish, are recorded in the Scroll of the Kings of Judah and Israel.<a name="fnB851" href="2ch_note.htm#fn851"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  Ahaz passed away<a name="fnB852" href="2ch_note.htm#fn852"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> and was buried in the City of David;<a name="fnB853" href="2ch_note.htm#fn853"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> they did not bring him to the tombs of the kings of Israel. His son Hezekiah replaced him as king.

<p><i>Hezekiah Consecrates the Temple</i>
<p><A NAME="29"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother was Abijah,<a name="fnB854" href="2ch_note.htm#fn854"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> the daughter of Zechariah. 
<bqverse 2>2  He did what the LORD approved, just as his ancestor David had done.<a name="fnB855" href="2ch_note.htm#fn855"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 3>3  In the first month of the first year of his reign, he opened the doors of the LORD's temple and repaired them. 
<bqverse 4>4  He brought in the priests and Levites and assembled them in the square on the east side. 
<bqverse 5>5  He said to them: "Listen to me, you Levites! Now consecrate yourselves, so you can consecrate the temple of the LORD God of your ancestors!<a name="fnB856" href="2ch_note.htm#fn856"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> Remove from the sanctuary what is ritually unclean! 
<bqverse 6>6  For our fathers were unfaithful; they did what is evil before the LORD our God and abandoned him. They turned<a name="fnB857" href="2ch_note.htm#fn857"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> away from the LORD's dwelling place and rejected him.<a name="fnB858" href="2ch_note.htm#fn858"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  They closed the doors of the temple porch and put out the lamps; they did not offer incense or burnt sacrifices in the sanctuary of the God of Israel. 
<bqverse 8>8  The LORD was angry at Judah and Jerusalem and made them an appalling object of horror at which people hiss out their scorn,<a name="fnB859" href="2ch_note.htm#fn859"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> as you can see with your own eyes. 
<bqverse 9>9  Look, our fathers died violently<a name="fnB860" href="2ch_note.htm#fn860"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> and our sons, daughters, and wives were carried off<a name="fnB861" href="2ch_note.htm#fn861"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> because of this. 
<bqverse 10>10  Now I intend<a name="fnB862" href="2ch_note.htm#fn862"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, so that he may relent from his raging anger.<a name="fnB863" href="2ch_note.htm#fn863"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  My sons, do not be negligent now, for the LORD has chosen you to serve in his presence and offer sacrifices."<a name="fnB864" href="2ch_note.htm#fn864"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 12>12  The following Levites prepared to carry out the king's orders:<a name="fnB865" href="2ch_note.htm#fn865"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a><p>
From the Kohathites: Machath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah;<p>
from the Merarites: Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel;<p>
from the Gershonites: Joach son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joach;<p>

<bqverse 13>13  from the descendants of Elizaphan: Shimri and Jeiel;<p>
from the descendants of Asaph: Zechariah and Mattaniah;<p>

<bqverse 14>14  from the descendants of Heman: Jechiel and Shimei;<p>
from the descendants of Jeduthun: Shemaiah and Uzziel.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  They assembled their brothers and consecrated themselves. Then they went in to purify the LORD's temple, just as the king had ordered in accordance with the word<a name="fnB866" href="2ch_note.htm#fn866"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> of the LORD. 
<bqverse 16>16  The priests then entered the LORD's temple to purify it; they brought out to the courtyard of the LORD's temple every ritually unclean thing they discovered inside.<a name="fnB867" href="2ch_note.htm#fn867"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> The Levites took them out to the Kidron Valley. 
<bqverse 17>17  On the first day of the first month they began consecrating; by the eighth day of the month they reached the porch of the LORD's temple.<a name="fnB868" href="2ch_note.htm#fn868"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> For eight more days they consecrated the LORD's temple. On the sixteenth day of the first month they were finished. 
<bqverse 18>18  They went to King Hezekiah and said: "We have purified the entire temple of the LORD, including the altar of burnt sacrifice and all its equipment, and the table for the ceremonial bread and all its equipment. 
<bqverse 19>19  We have prepared and consecrated all the items that King Ahaz removed during his reign when he acted unfaithfully. They are in front of the altar of the LORD."<p>

<bqverse 20>20  Early the next morning King Hezekiah assembled the city officials and went up to the LORD's temple. 
<bqverse 21>21  They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, the sanctuary, and Judah.<a name="fnB869" href="2ch_note.htm#fn869"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> The king<a name="fnB870" href="2ch_note.htm#fn870"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> told the priests, the descendants of Aaron, to offer burnt sacrifices on the altar of the LORD. 
<bqverse 22>22  They slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. Then they slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar; next they slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar. 
<bqverse 23>23  Finally they brought the goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they placed their hands on them. 
<bqverse 24>24  Then the priests slaughtered them. They offered their blood as a sin offering on the altar to make atonement for all Israel, because the king had decreed<a name="fnB871" href="2ch_note.htm#fn871"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> that the burnt sacrifice and sin offering were for all Israel.<p>

<bqverse 25>25  King Hezekiah<a name="fnB872" href="2ch_note.htm#fn872"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> stationed the Levites in the LORD's temple with cymbals and stringed instruments, just as David, Gad the king's prophet,<a name="fnB873" href="2ch_note.htm#fn873"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> and Nathan the prophet had ordered. (The LORD had actually given these orders through his prophets.) 
<bqverse 26>26  The Levites had<a name="fnB874" href="2ch_note.htm#fn874"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> David's musical instruments and the priests had trumpets. 
<bqverse 27>27  Hezekiah ordered the burnt sacrifice to be offered on the altar. As they began to offer the sacrifice, they also began to sing to the LORD, accompanied by the trumpets and the musical instruments of King David of Israel. 
<bqverse 28>28  The entire assembly worshiped, as the singers sang and the trumpeters played. They continued until the burnt sacrifice was completed.<p>

<bqverse 29>29  When the sacrifices were completed, the king and all who were with him bowed down and worshiped. 
<bqverse 30>30  King Hezekiah and the officials told the Levites to praise the LORD, using the psalms<a name="fnB875" href="2ch_note.htm#fn875"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> of David and Asaph the prophet.<a name="fnB876" href="2ch_note.htm#fn876"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> So they joyfully offered praise and bowed down and worshiped. 
<bqverse 31>31  Hezekiah said, "Now you have consecrated yourselves<a name="fnB877" href="2ch_note.htm#fn877"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> to the LORD. Come and bring sacrifices and tokens of thanks<a name="fnB878" href="2ch_note.htm#fn878"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> to the LORD's temple." So the assembly brought sacrifices and tokens of thanks, and whoever desired to do so<a name="fnB879" href="2ch_note.htm#fn879"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> brought burnt sacrifices.<p>

<bqverse 32>32  The assembly brought a total of seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs as burnt sacrifices to the LORD.<a name="fnB880" href="2ch_note.htm#fn880"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 33>33  Six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep<a name="fnB881" href="2ch_note.htm#fn881"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> were consecrated. 
<bqverse 34>34  But there were not enough priests to skin all the animals,<a name="fnB882" href="2ch_note.htm#fn882"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> so their brothers, the Levites, helped them until the work was finished and the priests could consecrate themselves. (The Levites had been more concerned about consecrating themselves than the priests.)<a name="fnB883" href="2ch_note.htm#fn883"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 35>35  There was a large number of burnt sacrifices, as well as fat from the peace offerings and drink offerings that accompanied the burnt sacrifices. So the service of the LORD's temple was reinstituted.<a name="fnB884" href="2ch_note.htm#fn884"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 36>36  Hezekiah and all the people were happy about what God had done<a name="fnB885" href="2ch_note.htm#fn885"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> for them,<a name="fnB886" href="2ch_note.htm#fn886"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> for it had been done quickly.<a name="fnB887" href="2ch_note.htm#fn887"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Hezekiah Observes the Passover</i>
<p><A NAME="30"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Hezekiah sent messages throughout Israel and Judah; he even wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, summoning them to come to the LORD's temple in Jerusalem and observe a Passover celebration for the LORD God of Israel. 
<bqverse 2>2  The king, his officials, and the entire assembly in Jerusalem decided to observe the Passover in the second month. 
<bqverse 3>3  They were unable to observe it at the regular<a name="fnB888" href="2ch_note.htm#fn888"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> time because not enough priests had consecrated themselves and the people had not assembled in Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 4>4  The proposal seemed appropriate to<a name="fnB889" href="2ch_note.htm#fn889"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> the king and the entire assembly. 
<bqverse 5>5  So they sent an edict<a name="fnB890" href="2ch_note.htm#fn890"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> throughout Israel from Beersheba to Dan, summoning the people<a name="fnB891" href="2ch_note.htm#fn891"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> to come and observe a Passover for the LORD God of Israel in Jerusalem, for they had not observed it on a nationwide scale as prescribed in the law.<a name="fnB892" href="2ch_note.htm#fn892"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  Messengers<a name="fnB893" href="2ch_note.htm#fn893"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> delivered the letters from the king and his officials throughout Israel and Judah. <p>

<bqverse 10>10  The messengers journeyed from city to city through the land of Ephraim and Manasseh as far as Zebulun, but people mocked and ridiculed them.<a name="fnB903" href="2ch_note.htm#fn903"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  But some men from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 12>12  In Judah God moved the people to unite and carry out the edict the king and the officers had issued at the LORD's command.<a name="fnB904" href="2ch_note.htm#fn904"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  A huge crowd assembled in Jerusalem to observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month.<a name="fnB905" href="2ch_note.htm#fn905"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  They removed the altars in Jerusalem; they also removed all the incense altars and threw them into the Kidron Valley.<a name="fnB906" href="2ch_note.htm#fn906"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 15>15  They slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and Levites were ashamed, so they consecrated themselves and brought burnt sacrifices to the LORD's temple. 
<bqverse 16>16  They stood at their posts according to the regulations outlined in the law of Moses, the man of God. The priests were sprinkling the blood as the Levites handed it to them.<a name="fnB907" href="2ch_note.htm#fn907"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  Because many in the assembly had not consecrated themselves, the Levites slaughtered<a name="fnB908" href="2ch_note.htm#fn908"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> the Passover lambs of all who were ritually unclean and could not consecrate their sacrifice to the LORD.<a name="fnB909" href="2ch_note.htm#fn909"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  The majority of the many people from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun were ritually unclean, yet they ate the Passover in violation of what is prescribed in the law.<a name="fnB910" href="2ch_note.htm#fn910"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> For Hezekiah prayed for them, saying: "May the LORD, who is good, forgive<a name="fnB911" href="2ch_note.htm#fn911"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 20>20  The LORD responded favorably<a name="fnB914" href="2ch_note.htm#fn914"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> to Hezekiah and forgave<a name="fnB915" href="2ch_note.htm#fn915"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> the people.<p>

<bqverse 21>21  The Israelites who were in Jerusalem observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy. The Levites and priests were praising the LORD every day with all their might.<a name="fnB916" href="2ch_note.htm#fn916"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  Hezekiah expressed his appreciation to all the Levites,<a name="fnB917" href="2ch_note.htm#fn917"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> who demonstrated great skill in serving the LORD.<a name="fnB918" href="2ch_note.htm#fn918"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> They feasted for the seven days of the festival,<a name="fnB919" href="2ch_note.htm#fn919"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> and were making peace offerings and giving thanks to the LORD God of their ancestors.<p>

<bqverse 23>23  The entire assembly then decided to celebrate for seven more days.; so they joyfully celebrated for seven more days. 
<bqverse 24>24  King Hezekiah of Judah supplied one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep<a name="fnB920" href="2ch_note.htm#fn920"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> for the assembly, while the officials supplied them<a name="fnB921" href="2ch_note.htm#fn921"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> with one thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep. Many priests consecrated themselves. 
<bqverse 25>25  The celebration included<a name="fnB922" href="2ch_note.htm#fn922"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> the entire assembly of Judah, the priests, the Levites, the entire assembly of those who came from Israel, the resident foreigners who came from the land of Israel, and the residents of Judah. 
<bqverse 26>26  There was a great celebration in Jerusalem, unlike anything that had occurred in Jerusalem since the time of King Solomon son of David of Israel.<a name="fnB923" href="2ch_note.htm#fn923"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  The priests and Levites got up and pronounced blessings on the people. The LORD responded favorably to them<a name="fnB924" href="2ch_note.htm#fn924"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> as their prayers reached his holy dwelling place in heaven.<p>

<p><i>The People Contribute to the Temple</i>
<p>
<bqverse 2>2  Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and Levites to do their assigned tasks<a name="fnB929" href="2ch_note.htm#fn929"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a>--to offer burnt sacrifices and present offerings and to serve, give thanks, and offer praise in the gates of the LORD's sanctuary.<a name="fnB930" href="2ch_note.htm#fn930"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 3>3  The king contributed<a name="fnB931" href="2ch_note.htm#fn931"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> some of what he owned for burnt sacrifices, including the morning and evening burnt sacrifices and the burnt sacrifices made on Sabbaths, new moon festivals, and at other appointed times prescribed<a name="fnB932" href="2ch_note.htm#fn932"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> in the law of the LORD. 
<bqverse 4>4  He ordered<a name="fnB933" href="2ch_note.htm#fn933"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> the people living in Jerusalem to contribute the portion prescribed for the priests and Levites so they might be obedient<a name="fnB934" href="2ch_note.htm#fn934"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> to the law of the LORD. 
<bqverse 5>5  When the edict was issued,<a name="fnB935" href="2ch_note.htm#fn935"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> the Israelites freely contributed<a name="fnB936" href="2ch_note.htm#fn936"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> the initial portion of their grain, wine, olive oil, honey, and all the produce of their fields. They brought a tenth of everything, which added up to a huge amount. 
<bqverse 6>6  The Israelites and people of Judah<a name="fnB937" href="2ch_note.htm#fn937"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> who lived in the cities of Judah also contributed a tenth of their cattle and sheep, as well as a tenth of the holy items consecrated to the LORD their God. They brought them and placed them in many heaps.<a name="fnB938" href="2ch_note.htm#fn938"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  In the third month they began piling their contributions in heaps<a name="fnB939" href="2ch_note.htm#fn939"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> and finished in the seventh month. 
<bqverse 8>8  When Hezekiah and the officials came and saw the heaps, they praised the LORD and pronounced blessings on his people Israel.<a name="fnB940" href="2ch_note.htm#fn940"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 9>9  When Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the heaps, 
<bqverse 10>10  Azariah, the head priest from the family of Zadok, said to him, "Since the contributions began arriving in the LORD's temple, we have had plenty to eat and have a large quantity left over. For the LORD has blessed his people, and this large amount remains." 
<bqverse 11>11  Hezekiah ordered that storerooms be prepared in the LORD's temple. When this was done,<a name="fnB941" href="2ch_note.htm#fn941"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  they brought in the contributions, tithes,<a name="fnB942" href="2ch_note.htm#fn942"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and consecrated items that had been offered.<a name="fnB943" href="2ch_note.htm#fn943"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> Konaniah, a Levite, was in charge of all this, assisted by his brother Shimei. 
<bqverse 13>13  Jechiel, Azaziah, Nachath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Machath, and Benaiah worked under the supervision of Konaniah and his brother Shimei, as directed by King Hezekiah and Azariah, the supervisor of God's temple. <p>

<bqverse 14>14  Kore son of Imnah, a Levite and the guard on the east side, was in charge of the voluntary offerings made to God and disbursed the contributions made to the LORD and the consecrated items. 
<bqverse 15>15  In the cities of the priests, Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shechaniah faithfully assisted him in making disbursements to their fellow priests<a name="fnB944" href="2ch_note.htm#fn944"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> according to their divisions, regardless of age.<a name="fnB945" href="2ch_note.htm#fn945"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  They made disbursements to all the males three years old and up who were listed in the genealogical records--to all who would enter the LORD's temple to serve on a daily basis and fulfill their duties as assigned to their divisions.<a name="fnB946" href="2ch_note.htm#fn946"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  They made disbursements to the priests listed in the genealogical records by their families, and to the Levites twenty years old and up, according to their duties as assigned to their divisions, 
<bqverse 18>18  and to all the infants, wives, sons, and daughters of the entire assembly listed in the genealogical records, for they faithfully consecrated themselves. 
<bqverse 19>19  As for the descendants of Aaron, the priests who lived in the outskirts of all their cities,<a name="fnB947" href="2ch_note.htm#fn947"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> men were assigned<a name="fnB948" href="2ch_note.htm#fn948"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> to disburse portions to every male among the priests and to every Levite listed in the genealogical records.<p>

<bqverse 20>20  This is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah. He did what the LORD his God considered good and right and faithful. 
<bqverse 21>21  He wholeheartedly and successfully reinstituted service in God's temple and obedience to the law, in order to follow his God.<a name="fnB949" href="2ch_note.htm#fn949"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Sennacherib Invades Judah</i>
<p><A NAME="32"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> After these faithful deeds were accomplished, King Sennacherib of Assyria invaded Judah. He besieged the fortified cities, intending to seize them.<a name="fnB950" href="2ch_note.htm#fn950"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had invaded and intended to attack Jerusalem,<a name="fnB951" href="2ch_note.htm#fn951"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  he consulted with his advisers and military officers about stopping up the springs<a name="fnB952" href="2ch_note.htm#fn952"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> outside the city and they supported him. 
<bqverse 4>4  A large number of people gathered together and stopped up all the springs and the stream that flowed through the district.<a name="fnB953" href="2ch_note.htm#fn953"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> They reasoned,<a name="fnB954" href="2ch_note.htm#fn954"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> "Why should the kings of Assyria come and find a lot of water?" 
<bqverse 5>5  Hezekiah<a name="fnB955" href="2ch_note.htm#fn955"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> energetically rebuilt<a name="fnB956" href="2ch_note.htm#fn956"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> every broken wall. He erected towers and an outer wall,<a name="fnB957" href="2ch_note.htm#fn957"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> and fortified the terrace of the City of David.<a name="fnB958" href="2ch_note.htm#fn958"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> He made many weapons and shields.<p>

<bqverse 6>6  He appointed military officers over the army<a name="fnB959" href="2ch_note.htm#fn959"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and assembled them in the square at the city gate. He encouraged them,<a name="fnB960" href="2ch_note.htm#fn960"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> saying, 
<bqverse 7>7  "Be strong and brave!

The army<a name="fnB964" href="2ch_note.htm#fn964"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> was encouraged by the words of King Hezekiah of Judah.<p>

<bqverse 9>9  Afterward King Sennacherib of Assyria, while attacking Lachish with all his military might, sent his messengers<a name="fnB965" href="2ch_note.htm#fn965"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> to Jerusalem,.

It read: 
<bqverse 10>10  "This is what King Sennacherib of Assyria says: `Why are you so confident that you remain in Jerusalem while it is under siege?<a name="fnB967" href="2ch_note.htm#fn967"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  Hezekiah says, "The LORD our God will rescue us from the power<a name="fnB968" href="2ch_note.htm#fn968"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> of the king of Assyria." But he is misleading you and you will die of hunger and thirst!<a name="fnB969" href="2ch_note.htm#fn969"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  Hezekiah is the one who eliminated<a name="fnB970" href="2ch_note.htm#fn970"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD's<a name="fnB971" href="2ch_note.htm#fn971"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> high places and altars and then told Judah and Jerusalem, "At one altar you must worship and offer sacrifices." 
<bqverse 13>13  Are you not aware of what I and my predecessors<a name="fnB972" href="2ch_note.htm#fn972"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> have done to all the nations of the surrounding lands?

<bqverse 15>15  Now don't let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you like this.

<bqverse 16>16  Sennacherib's<a name="fnB977" href="2ch_note.htm#fn977"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> servants further insulted<a name="fnB978" href="2ch_note.htm#fn978"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD God and his servant Hezekiah. 
<bqverse 17>17  He wrote letters mocking the LORD God of Israel and insulting him with these words:<a name="fnB979" href="2ch_note.htm#fn979"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> "The gods of the surrounding nations could not rescue their people from my power.

<bqverse 18>18  They called out loudly in the Judahite dialect to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, trying to scare and terrify them so they could seize the city. 
<bqverse 19>19  They talked about the God of Jerusalem as if he were one of the man-made gods of the nations of the earth.<p>

<bqverse 20>20  King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz prayed about this and cried out to heaven. 
<bqverse 21>21  The LORD sent a messenger<a name="fnB981" href="2ch_note.htm#fn981"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> and he wiped out all the soldiers, princes, and officers in the army of the king of Assyria.

<bqverse 22>22  The LORD delivered Hezekiah and the residents of Jerusalem from the power of King Sennacherib of Assyria and the other nations.<a name="fnB985" href="2ch_note.htm#fn985"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> He made them secure on every side.<a name="fnB986" href="2ch_note.htm#fn986"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Hezekiah's Shortcomings and Accomplishments</i>

<bqverse 24>24  In those days Hezekiah was stricken with a terminal illness.<a name="fnB989" href="2ch_note.htm#fn989"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> He prayed to the LORD, who answered him and gave him a sign confirming that he would be healed.<a name="fnB990" href="2ch_note.htm#fn990"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  But Hezekiah was ungrateful; he had a proud attitude, provoking God to be angry at him, as well as Judah and Jerusalem.<a name="fnB991" href="2ch_note.htm#fn991"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  But then Hezekiah and the residents of Jerusalem humbled themselves and abandoned their pride, and the LORD was not angry with them for the rest of Hezekiah's reign.<a name="fnB992" href="2ch_note.htm#fn992"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 27>27  Hezekiah was very wealthy and greatly respected. He made storehouses for his silver, gold, precious stones, spices, and all his other valuable possessions.<a name="fnB993" href="2ch_note.htm#fn993"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  He made storerooms for the harvest of grain, wine, and olive oil, and stalls for all his various kinds of livestock and his flocks.<a name="fnB994" href="2ch_note.htm#fn994"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 29>29  He built royal cities<a name="fnB995" href="2ch_note.htm#fn995"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> and owned a large number of sheep and cattle, for God gave him a huge amount of possessions.<p>

<p><i>Manasseh's Reign</i>
<p><A NAME="33"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned for fifty-five years in Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 2>2  He did evil before<a name="fnB1002" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1002"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD and committed the same horrible sins practiced by the nations<a name="fnB1003" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1003"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> whom the LORD drove out before the Israelites. 
<bqverse 3>3  He rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed; he set up altars for the Baals and made Asherah poles. He bowed down to all the stars in the sky<a name="fnB1004" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1004"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> and worshiped<a name="fnB1005" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1005"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> them. 
<bqverse 4>4  He built altars in the LORD's temple, about which the LORD had said, "Jerusalem will be my permanent home."<a name="fnB1006" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1006"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  In the two courtyards of the LORD's temple he built altars for all the stars in the sky. 
<bqverse 6>6  He passed his sons through the fire<a name="fnB1007" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1007"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom and practiced divination, omen reading, and sorcery. He set up a pit to conjure up underworld spirits and appointed magicians to supervise it.<a name="fnB1008" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1008"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> He did a great amount of evil before the LORD and angered him.<a name="fnB1009" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1009"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  He put an idolatrous image he had made in God's temple, about which God had said to David and to his son Solomon, "This temple in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will be my permanent home.<a name="fnB1010" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1010"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  I will not make Israel again leave the land I gave to their ancestors,<a name="fnB1011" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1011"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> provided that they carefully obey all I commanded them, the whole law, the rules and regulations given to Moses." 
<bqverse 9>9  But Manasseh misled the people of<a name="fnB1012" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1012"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> Judah and the residents of Jerusalem so that they sinned more than the nations whom the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites.<p>

<bqverse 10>10  The LORD confronted<a name="fnB1013" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1013"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> Manasseh and his people, but they paid no attention. 
<bqverse 11>11  So the LORD brought against them the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria. They seized Manasseh, put hooks in his nose,<a name="fnB1014" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1014"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> bound him with bronze chains, and carried him away to Babylon. 
<bqverse 12>12  In his pain<a name="fnB1015" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1015"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> Manasseh<a name="fnB1016" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1016"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> asked the LORD his God for mercy<a name="fnB1017" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1017"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> and truly<a name="fnB1018" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1018"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> humbled himself before the God of his ancestors.<a name="fnB1019" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1019"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  When he prayed to the LORD,<a name="fnB1020" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1020"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD<a name="fnB1021" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1021"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> responded to him<a name="fnB1022" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1022"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> and answered favorably<a name="fnB1023" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1023"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> his cry for mercy. The LORD<a name="fnB1024" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1024"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> brought him back to Jerusalem to his kingdom. Then Manasseh realized that the LORD is the true God.<p>

<bqverse 14>14  After this Manasseh<a name="fnB1025" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1025"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> built up the outer wall of the City of David<a name="fnB1026" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1026"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> on the west side of the Gihon in the valley to the entrance of the Fish Gate and all around the terrace; he made it much higher. He placed army officers in all the fortified cities in Judah.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  He removed the foreign gods and images from the LORD's temple and all the altars he had built on the hill of the LORD's temple and in Jerusalem; he threw them outside the city. 
<bqverse 16>16  He erected the altar of the LORD and offered on it peace offerings and thank offerings. He told the people of<a name="fnB1027" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1027"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel. 
<bqverse 17>17  The people continued to offer sacrifices at the high places, but only to the LORD their God.<p>

<bqverse 18>18  The rest of the events of Manasseh's reign, including his prayer to his God and the words the prophets<a name="fnB1028" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1028"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, are recorded<a name="fnB1029" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1029"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> in the Annals of the Kings of Israel.

<p><i>Josiah Institutes Religious Reforms</i>
<p><A NAME="34"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned for thirty-one years in Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 2>2  He did what the LORD approved<a name="fnB1037" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1037"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> and followed in his ancestor David's footsteps;<a name="fnB1038" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1038"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> he did not deviate to the right or the left.<p>

<bqverse 3>3  In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, he began to seek the God of his ancestor<a name="fnB1039" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1039"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> David. In his twelfth year he began ridding<a name="fnB1040" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1040"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, Asherah poles, idols, and images. 
<bqverse 4>4  He ordered the altars of the Baals to be torn down,<a name="fnB1041" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1041"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and broke the incense altars that were above them. He smashed the Asherah poles, idols and images, crushed them up and sprinkled the dust over the tombs of those who had sacrificed to them. 
<bqverse 5>5  He burned the bones of the priests on their altars; he purified Judah and Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 6>6  In the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, as far as Naphtali, and in the ruins<a name="fnB1042" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1042"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> around them, 
<bqverse 7>7  he tore down the altars and Asherah poles, demolished the idols, and smashed all the incense altars throughout the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem.<p>

<bqverse 8>8  In the eighteenth year of his reign, he continued his policy of purifying the land and the temple.<a name="fnB1043" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1043"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> He sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the city official, and Joach son of Joachaz the secretary to repair the temple of the LORD his God. 
<bqverse 9>9  They went to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the silver that had been brought to God's temple. The Levites who guarded the door had collected it from the people of<a name="fnB1044" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1044"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> Manasseh and Ephraim and from all who were left in Israel, as well as from all the people of<a name="fnB1045" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1045"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> Judah and Benjamin and the residents of<a name="fnB1046" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1046"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 10>10  They handed it over to the construction foremen<a name="fnB1047" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1047"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> assigned to the LORD's temple. They in turn paid the temple workers to restore and repair it.<a name="fnB1048" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1048"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  They gave money to the craftsmen and builders to buy chiseled stone and wood for the braces and rafters of the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to fall into disrepair.<a name="fnB1049" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1049"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  The men worked faithfully. Their supervisors were Jachath and Obadiah (Levites descended from Merari), as well as Zechariah and Meshullam (descendants of Kohath). The Levites, all of whom were skilled musicians, 
<bqverse 13>13  supervised the laborers and all the foremen on their various jobs.<a name="fnB1050" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1050"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> Some of the Levites were scribes, officials, and guards.<p>

<bqverse 14>14  When they took out the silver that had been brought to the LORD's temple, Hilkiah the priest found the law scroll the LORD had given to Moses. 
<bqverse 15>15  Hilkiah informed Shaphan the scribe, "I found the law scroll in the LORD's temple." Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphan. 
<bqverse 16>16  Shaphan brought the scroll to the king and reported,<a name="fnB1051" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1051"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> "Your servants are doing everything assigned to them. 
<bqverse 17>17  They melted down the silver in the LORD's temple<a name="fnB1052" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1052"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> and handed it over to the supervisors of the construction foremen." 
<bqverse 18>18  Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a scroll." Shaphan read it out loud before the king. 
<bqverse 19>19  When the king heard the words of the law scroll, he tore his clothes. 
<bqverse 20>20  The king ordered Hilkiah, Achikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, 
<bqverse 21>21  "Go, seek an oracle from<a name="fnB1053" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1053"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD for me and those who remain in Israel and Judah. Find out about<a name="fnB1054" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1054"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> the words of this scroll that has been discovered. For the LORD's fury has been ignited against us,<a name="fnB1055" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1055"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> because our ancestors<a name="fnB1056" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1056"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> have not obeyed the word of the LORD by doing all that this scroll instructs!"<a name="fnB1057" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1057"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 22>22  So Hilkiah and the others sent by the king<a name="fnB1058" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1058"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, the supervisor of the wardrobe.<a name="fnB1059" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1059"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> (She lived in Jerusalem in the Mishneh<a name="fnB1060" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1060"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> district.)

<bqverse 23>23  and she said to them: "This is what the LORD God of Israel says: `Say this to the man who sent you to me: 
<bqverse 24>24  "This is what the LORD says: `I am about to bring disaster on this place and its residents, the details of which are recorded on the scroll which they read before the king of Judah.<sup> </sup>
<bqverse 25>25  This will happen because they have abandoned me and offered sacrifices<a name="fnB1062" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1062"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> to other gods, angering me with all the idols they have made.<a name="fnB1063" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1063"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> My anger will ignite against this place and will not be extinguished.'" 
<bqverse 26>26  Say this to the king of Judah, who sent you to seek an oracle from the LORD: "This is what the LORD God of Israel says concerning the words you have heard: 
<bqverse 27>27  `You displayed a sensitive spirit<a name="fnB1064" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1064"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> and humbled yourself before God when you heard his words concerning this place and its residents. You humbled yourself before me, tore your clothes and wept before me, and I have heard you,' says the LORD. 
<bqverse 28>28  `Therefore I will allow you to die and be buried in peace.<a name="fnB1065" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1065"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> You will not have to witness all the disaster I will bring on this place and its residents.'"'" Then they reported back to the king.<p>

<bqverse 2>2  He appointed the priests to fulfill their duties and encouraged them to carry out their service in the LORD's temple. 
<bqverse 3>3  He told the Levites, who instructed all Israel about things consecrated to the LORD, "Place the holy ark in the temple which King Solomon son of David of Israel built. Don't carry it on your shoulders. Now serve the LORD your God and his people Israel! 
<bqverse 4>4  Prepare yourselves by your families according to your divisions, as instructed<a name="fnB1075" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1075"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> by King David of Israel and his son Solomon. 
<bqverse 5>5  Stand in the sanctuary and, together with the Levites, represent the family divisions of your countrymen.<a name="fnB1076" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1076"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 7>7  From his own royal flocks and herds, Josiah supplied the people with thirty thousand lambs and goats for the Passover sacrifice, as well as three thousand cattle.<a name="fnB1078" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1078"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  His officials also willingly contributed to the people, priests, and Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jechiel, the leaders of God's temple, supplied twenty-six hundred Passover sacrifices and three hundred cattle. 
<bqverse 9>9  Konaniah and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, along with Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, the officials of the Levites, supplied the Levites with five thousand Passover sacrifices and five hundred cattle. 
<bqverse 10>10  Preparations were made,<a name="fnB1079" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1079"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and the priests stood at their posts and the Levites in their divisions as prescribed by the king. 
<bqverse 11>11  They slaughtered the Passover lambs and the priests sprinkled the blood,<a name="fnB1080" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1080"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> while the Levites skinned the animals. 
<bqverse 12>12  They reserved the burnt offerings and the cattle for the family divisions of the people to present to the LORD, as prescribed in the scroll of Moses.<a name="fnB1081" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1081"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  They cooked the Passover sacrifices over the open fire as prescribed and cooked the consecrated offerings in pots, kettles, and pans. They quickly served them to all the people. 
<bqverse 14>14  Afterward they made preparations for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were offering burnt sacrifices and fat portions until evening. The Levites made preparations for themselves and for the priests, the descendants of Aaron. 
<bqverse 15>15  The musicians, the descendants of Asaph, manned their posts, as prescribed by David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king's prophet.<a name="fnB1082" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1082"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> The guards at the various gates did not need to leave their posts, for their fellow Levites made preparations for them. 
<bqverse 16>16  So all the preparations for the LORD's service were made that day, as the Passover was observed and the burnt sacrifices were offered on the altar of the LORD, as prescribed by King Josiah. 
<bqverse 17>17  So the Israelites who were present observed the Passover at that time, as well as the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days. 
<bqverse 18>18  A Passover like this had not been observed in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet. None of the kings of Israel had observed a Passover like the one celebrated by Josiah, the priests, the Levites, all the people of Judah and Israel who were there, and the residents of Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 19>19  This Passover was observed in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign.<a name="_Toc494012167"></a></p>
<p><i>Josiah's Reign Ends</i>
<p>
<bqverse 20>20  After Josiah had done all this for the temple,<a name="fnB1083" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1083"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> King Neco of Egypt marched up to do battle at Carchemish on the Euphrates River.<a name="fnB1084" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1084"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> Josiah marched out to oppose him. 
<bqverse 21>21  Neco<a name="fnB1085" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1085"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> sent messengers to him, saying, "Why are you opposing me, O king of Judah?<a name="fnB1086" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1086"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> I am not attacking you today, but the kingdom with which I am at war.<a name="fnB1087" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1087"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> God told me to hurry.

<bqverse 22>22  But Josiah did not turn back from him;<a name="fnB1089" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1089"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> he disguised himself for battle. He did not take seriously<a name="fnB1090" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1090"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> the words of Neco which he had received from God; he went to fight him in the Plain of Megiddo. 
<bqverse 23>23  Archers shot King Josiah; the king ordered his servants, "Take me out of this chariot,<a name="fnB1091" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1091"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> for I am seriously wounded." 
<bqverse 24>24  So his servants took him out of the chariot, put him in another chariot that he owned, and brought him to Jerusalem, where he died. He was buried in the tombs of his ancestors;<a name="fnB1092" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1092"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> all the people of Judah and Jerusalem mourned Josiah. 
<bqverse 25>25  Jeremiah composed laments for Josiah which all the male and female singers use to mourn Josiah to this very day. It has become customary in Israel to sing these; they are recorded in the Book of Laments.<p>

<bqverse 26>26  The rest of the events of Josiah's reign, including the faithful acts he did in obedience to what is written in the law of the LORD<a name="fnB1093" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1093"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  and his accomplishments, from start to finish, are recorded<a name="fnB1094" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1094"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> in the Scroll of the Kings of Israel and Judah.

<p><i>Jehoahaz's Reign</i>
<p><A NAME="36"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> The people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and made him king in his father's place in Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 2>2  Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 3>3  The king of Egypt prevented him from ruling in Jerusalem and imposed on the land a special tax<a name="fnB1095" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1095"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> of one hundred units<a name="fnB1096" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1096"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> of silver and a unit<a name="fnB1097" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1097"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> of gold. 
<bqverse 4>4  The king of Egypt made Jehoahaz's<a name="fnB1098" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1098"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> brother Eliakim king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim.

<p><i>Jehoiakim's Reign</i>

<bqverse 5>5  Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. He did evil before<a name="fnB1099" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1099"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD his God.<sup> </sup>

<bqverse 7>7  Nebuchadnezzar took some of the items in the LORD's temple to Babylon and put them in his palace<a name="fnB1102" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1102"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> there.<a name="fnB1103" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1103"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 8>8  The rest of the events of Jehoiakim's reign, including the horrible sins he committed and his shortcomings, are recorded in the Scroll of the Kings of Israel and Judah.<a name="fnB1104" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1104"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> His son Jehoiachin replaced him as king. <a name="_Toc494012170"></a></p>
<p><i>Jehoiachin's Reign</i>
<p>
<bqverse 9>9  Jehoiachin was eighteen<a name="fnB1105" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1105"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> years old when he became king, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem.

<bqverse 10>10  At the beginning of the year King Nebuchadnezzar ordered him to be brought<a name="fnB1107" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> to Babylon, along with the valuable items in the LORD's temple.

<bqverse 11>11  Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he ruled for eleven years in Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 12>12  He did evil before<a name="fnB1109" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1109"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD his God. He did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, the LORD's spokesman. 
<bqverse 13>13  He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him vow allegiance<a name="fnB1110" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> in the name of God. He was stubborn and obstinate, and refused to return<a name="fnB1111" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> to the LORD God of Israel. 
<bqverse 14>14  All the leaders of the priests and people became more unfaithful and committed the same horrible sins practiced by the nations.<a name="fnB1112" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1112"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> They defiled the LORD's temple which he had consecrated in Jerusalem. <a name="_Toc494012172"></a></p>
<p><i>The Babylonians Destroy Jerusalem</i>

<bqverse 15>15  The LORD God of their ancestors<a name="fnB1113" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1113"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> continually warned them through his messengers,<a name="fnB1114" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1114"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> for he felt compassion for his people and his dwelling place. 
<bqverse 16>16  But they mocked God's messengers, despised his warnings,<a name="fnB1115" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1115"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> and ridiculed his prophets.<a name="fnB1116" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1116"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> Finally the LORD got angry at his people and there was no one who could prevent his judgment.<a name="fnB1117" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1117"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  He brought against them the king of the Babylonians, who slaughtered<a name="fnB1118" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1118"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> their young men in their temple.<a name="fnB1119" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1119"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> He did not spare<a name="fnB1120" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1120"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> young men or women, or even the old and aging. God<a name="fnB1121" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1121"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> handed everyone over to him. 
<bqverse 18>18  He carried away to Babylon all the items in God's temple, whether large or small, as well as what was in the treasuries of the LORD's temple and in the treasuries of the king and his officials. 
<bqverse 19>19  They burned down the LORD's temple and tore down the wall of Jerusalem. They burned all its fortified buildings and destroyed all its valuable items. 
<bqverse 20>20  He deported to Babylon all who escaped the sword. They served him and his sons until the Persian kingdom rose to power. 
<bqverse 21>21  This took place to fulfill the LORD's message delivered through Jeremiah.<a name="fnB1122" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1122"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> The land experienced<a name="fnB1123" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1123"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> its sabbatical years;<a name="fnB1124" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1124"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> it remained desolate for seventy years,<a name="fnB1125" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1125"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> as prophesied.<a name="fnB1126" href="2ch_note.htm#fn1126"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494012173"></a></p>
