 <b>tn</b> (1:1)  The word "From" is not in the Greek text, but has been supplied to indicate the sender of the letter.<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="2jo.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  Or "presbyter." The author's self-designation, the "elder," is in keeping with the reticence of the author of the Gospel of John to identify himself. This is the same self-designation used by the author of 3 John.<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="2jo.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  This phrase may refer to an individual or to a church (or the church at large). Some have suggested that the addressee is a Christian lady named "Electa," but the same word in v. 13 is clearly an adjective, not a proper name. Others see the letter addressed to a Christian lady named "Kyria" (first proposed by Athanasius) or to an unnamed Christian lady. The internal evidence of 2 John clearly supports a collective reference, however. In v. 6 the addressee is mentioned using second person plural, and this is repeated in vv. 8, 10, and 12. Only in v. 13 does the singular reappear. The uses in vv. 1 and 13 are most likely collective. Some have seen a reference to the church at large, but v. 13, referring to "the children of your elect sister" is hard to understand if the universal church is in view. Thus the most probable explanation is that the "elect lady" is a particular local church at some distance from where the author is located.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:1)  2 John is being written to warn a "sister" church some distance away, referred to as <i>an elect lady</i>, of the missionary efforts of the secessionist false teachers (discussed in 1 John) and the dangers of welcoming them whenever they arrive.<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="2jo.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  The prepositional phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn ajlhqeiva/ </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">en alhqeia</FONT>) in 2 John 1 is similar to 3 John 1, although it is not qualified there as it is here (see 3 John 1). This is not merely the equivalent of an adverb ("truly"), but is a theological statement affirming the orthodoxy of Gaius, to whom the letter is addressed. "Truth" is the author's way of alluding to theological orthodoxy in the face of the challenge by the opponents (see 1 John 3:19).<br>
 <a name="fn4" href="2jo.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:1)  <i>All those who know the truth</i> refers to true Christians who are holding fast to the apostolic Christology in the face of the secessionist opponents described in 1 John.<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="2jo.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:2)  The prepositional phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">diaV thVn ajlhvqei-an</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">dia thn alhqeian</FONT>, "because of the truth") is missing in a number of significant MSS, among them <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Y</FONT> 614 1241 1739 <i>et alii</i>. However, it looks to be a simple case of homoioteleuton, for v. 1 ends with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">thVn ajlhvqeian</FONT>. For some of these MSS it could be an intentional omission, for the sense of the passage is largely the same without the prepositional phrase (the following adjectival participle, in this case, would simply attach itself to the previous <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">thVn ajlhvqeian</FONT>).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:2)  While <i>truth</i> certainly has a doctrinal aspect in this context, the following phrase <i>that resides in us and will be with us forever</i> suggests more than doctrine is involved. A close parallel is John 14:16-17 where Jesus promised his disciples that the Spirit (Paraclete) would be with them forever: "He remains with you and will be in you." The "truth" the author speaks of here is a manifestation of the Spirit of Truth who is permanently with the believer.<br>
 <a name="fn6" href="2jo.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  "And" is not in the Greek text. It is supplied for smoothness in English.<br>
 <a name="fn7" href="2jo.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  "Some" is not in the Greek text, but is supplied because the prepositional phrase beginning with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejk</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ek</FONT>) has partitive force. The partitive force of the prepositional phrase here has been taken by some interpreters to mean that the author has found some of the elect lady's children who are living according to the truth and some who are not. This is grammatically possible, but the author has merely stated that he knows of some Christians in the church addressed who are "walking in the truth." He does not know for certain that all of them are, and concern over this is probably part of the motivation for writing the letter.<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="2jo.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:4)  <i>Living according to the truth </i>(<i>Grk</i> "walking in [the] truth"). The use of the Greek verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">peripatevw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">peripatew</FONT>) to refer to conduct or lifestyle is common in the NT (see 1 John 1:6, 3 John 3-4, as well as numerous times in Paul. Here the phrase refers to conduct that results when a person has "truth" residing within, and possibly alludes to the indwelling Spirit of Truth (see 2 John 2). In the specific context of 2 John the phrase refers to true Christians who are holding fast to an apostolic Christology in the face of the secessionist opponents' challenge to orthodoxy.<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="2jo.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  <i>Grk</i> "just as we received commandment from the Father." The idiom "we received commandment from the Father" means the Father gave (a) commandment to them (the author plus the recipients).<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="2jo.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  The introductory <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiV nu'n</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai nun</FONT>) has some adversative (contrastive) force: The addressees are already "living according to the truth" (v. 4) but in the face of the threat posed by the opponents, the author has to stress obedience all the more.<br>
 <a name="fn11" href="2jo.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  The words "if I were" are not in the Greek text, but are supplied for clarity in English.<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="2jo.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:5)  An allusion to John 13:34-35, 1 John 2:7-8.<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="2jo.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:5)  For <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kainhVn grafw'n soi'</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kainhn grafwn soi</FONT>), codices B P and the Byzantine cursives have <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">soi' grafw'n kainhvn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">soi grafwn kainhn</FONT>). The word order is thus a bit unusual (especially with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kainhvn</FONT> being now separated from the noun it modifies, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejntolhvn</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">entolhn</FONT>]), though not out of sync with other anarthrous noun-adjective constructions in the NT (viz., on a rare occasion intervening words, even verb forms, can come between the noun and attributive adjective). This thus has the earmarks of authenticity, except that this stylized word order seems to be characteristic of P <i>Byz</i> in this epistle (cf. also <i>v.ll.</i> <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejstiVn hJ ejntolhv</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">estin Jh entolh</FONT>] in v. 6, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJmw'n hJ peplhrwmevnh</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jhmwn Jh peplhrwmenh</FONT>] in v. 12). Thus, these witnesses seem to have a predilection of going against the grain in representing the word order of the elder. In light of the fact that NT grammarians are still wrestling with the significance of word order (not to mention the establishing of a `normal' word order), one must at the present time fall back on external evidence. The reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kainhVn grafw'n soi'</FONT> is so well supported that it should be judged to be original. Translation is not affected either way by this problem. <br>
 <a name="fn14" href="2jo.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  "The one" is not in the Greek text. It is supplied for clarity in English.<br>
 <a name="fn15" href="2jo.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:5)  See 1 John 2:7.<br>
 <a name="fn16" href="2jo.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  The <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{na</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jina</FONT>) clause indicates content.<br>
 <a name="fn17" href="2jo.htm#fnB17"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  The <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{na</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jina</FONT>) clause indicates result, parallel to John 13:34 where the final <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{na</FONT> clause also indicates result.<br>
 <a name="fn18" href="2jo.htm#fnB18"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  Technically this <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joti</FONT>) clause is subordinate to the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">peripath'te</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">peripathte</FONT>) at the end of v. 6, giving the reason why the readers should walk in the commandment to love one another. But BDF &#167;456.1 notes that subordination "is often very loose" in such cases and can be translated "for." Thus the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{ti</FONT> assumes something of an inferential sense, drawing an inference based on what has preceded.<br>
 <a name="fn19" href="2jo.htm#fnB19"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  "As" is not in the Greek text. It is supplied for clarity in English, since (like in the same confession in 1 John 4:2) <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">*Ihsou'n</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Ihsoun</FONT>) should be understood as object and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Cristovn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Criston</FONT>) as complement of an object-complement double accusative construction.<br>
 <a name="fn20" href="2jo.htm#fnB20"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  Or "Messiah."<br>
 <a name="fn21" href="2jo.htm#fnB21"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  This is the same confession as in 1 John 4:2 except the perfect participle used there is replaced by a present participle (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejrcovmenon</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ercomenon</FONT>) here. It is not clear why the author changed from a perfect participle in 1 John 4:2 to a present participle here. The perfect participle suggests a reference to the incarnation (past). The present participle could suggest a reference to the (future) second advent, but based on the similarity to 1 John 4:2 is it probably best to take it as referring to the incarnation.<br>
 <a name="fn22" href="2jo.htm#fnB22"><sup>23</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:7)  The statement <i>This person is the Deceiver and the Antichrist!</i> is a metaphor (metonymy). The author does not mean that each individual is to be identified as the Antichrist. The opponents are compared to the Deceiver (Satan) and the Antichrist since they are accomplishing Satan's work and preparing the way for the Antichrist.<br>
 <a name="fn23" href="2jo.htm#fnB23"><sup>24</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:8)  The<i> things we have worked for </i>probably refers to the pastoral and missionary efforts undertaken by the recipients of the letter in their own community and surrounding communities. This work would be "lost" if the opponents with their false teaching are allowed to proselytize unopposed.<br>
 <a name="fn24" href="2jo.htm#fnB24"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:8)  The idea of a <i>reward</i> for Christians who serve faithfully is not common in the Johannine writings, but can be found in Rev 11:18 and 22:12.<br>
 <a name="fn25" href="2jo.htm#fnB25"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  The construction <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pa'" oJ</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">pas Jo</FONT>) + participle occur frequently in 1 John (13 times) where it is used by the author to divide people into categories: "everyone who does this" as opposed to "everyone who does the opposite."<br>
 <a name="fn26" href="2jo.htm#fnB26"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  Here <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mevnw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">menw</FONT>) is translated "remain" rather than "reside" since a change in status or position is present in the context: the opponents did not "remain" but "ran on ahead." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mevnw</FONT> is used only here (twice in this verse) in the Johannine letters in connection with "teaching" but in the Gospel of John it is used three times with reference to the teaching of Jesus himself (7:16, 17; 18:19).<br>
 <a name="fn27" href="2jo.htm#fnB27"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  The genitive <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tou' Cristou' </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl"><i>tou Cristou</i></FONT>, "of Christ") is difficult because it may be understood as objective (the teaching about Christ), subjective (Christ's own teaching), or both (M. Zerwick's "general" genitive [<i>Biblical Greek </i>&#167;&#167;36-39]; D. B. Wallace calls this a "plenary" genitive [<i>Exegetical Syntax</i>, 119-121]). An objective genitive (with Christ as the object of the "apostolic" teaching) might seem to be the obvious reading in context, especially since verse 7 makes reference to what a person "confesses" about Jesus Christ. A good case can also be made for a subjective genitive, however, since other Johannine uses of the genitive following the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">didachv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">didach</FONT>, "teaching") favor a subjective sense here. In John 7:16, 17 Jesus himself refers to "my teaching" and "teaching from me," and 18:19 refers to "his (Jesus') teaching." Rev 2:14, 15 refers to the "teaching of Balaam" and "the teaching of the Nicolaitans," both of which are clearly subjective in context. In the present context, to speak of "Christ's teaching" as a subjective genitive would make Christ himself (in the person of the indwelling Spirit) the teacher, and this is consistent with the author's position in 1 John 2:27 that the community does not need other teachers. In 1 John 2:27 it is the Paraclete, referred to as "his anointing," who does the teaching. Since the dispute with the opponents concerns the salvific significance of the earthly life and ministry of Jesus, the "teaching" here would refer to Jesus' own teaching (reflected in the Gospel of John) concerning his person and work. Since this is ultimately one with the apostolic eyewitness testimony about Jesus, it is perhaps best to view the genitive here as both objective and subjective (perhaps the author deliberately intended not to be specific).<br>
 <a name="fn28" href="2jo.htm#fnB28"><sup>29</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:9)  The idiom translated <i>have God</i> means to have a relationship to God as a genuine believer. The phrase <i>has both the Father and the Son</i> later in this verse should be understood the same way.<br>
 <a name="fn29" href="2jo.htm#fnB29"><sup>30</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:10)  <i>Do not give him any greeting</i> does not mean to insult the person. It means "do not greet the person as a fellow Christian" (which is impossible anyway since the opponents are not genuine believers in the author's opinion).<br>
 <a name="fn30" href="2jo.htm#fnB30"><sup>31</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:11)  <i>Shares in his evil deeds. </i>Giving a public greeting could be understood by an onlooker to suggest agreement with the (false) teaching of the opponents and is thus prohibited by John.<br>
 <a name="fn31" href="2jo.htm#fnB31"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:12)  "Other" is not in the Greek text but is supplied for clarity in English.<br>
 <a name="fn32" href="2jo.htm#fnB32"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:12)  <i>Grk</i> "by means of."<br>
 <a name="fn33" href="2jo.htm#fnB33"><sup>34</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:12)  Presumably the author means he would rather say the additional things he wants to say to the recipients in person rather than by letter (<i>with paper and ink</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn34" href="2jo.htm#fnB34"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:12)  <i>Grk</i> "speak mouth to mouth," an idiom for which the English equivalent is "speak face to face."<br>
