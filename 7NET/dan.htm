<p><A NAME="1"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> In the third<a name="fnB0" href="dan_note.htm#fn0"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> year of the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah that King Nebuchadnezzar<a name="fnB1" href="dan_note.htm#fn1"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> of Babylon advanced against Jerusalem and laid it under siege.<a name="fnB2" href="dan_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  Now the Lord<a name="fnB3" href="dan_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> delivered<a name="fnB4" href="dan_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> King Jehoiakim of Judah into his power,<a name="fnB5" href="dan_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> along with some of the vessels<a name="fnB6" href="dan_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> of God's temple.<a name="fnB7" href="dan_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> He brought them to the land of Babylonia<a name="fnB8" href="dan_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> to the temple of his gods<a name="fnB9" href="dan_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and put<a name="fnB10" href="dan_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> the vessels in the treasury of his gods.<p>

<bqverse 3>3  The king commanded<a name="fnB11" href="dan_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> Ashpenaz,<a name="fnB12" href="dan_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> who was in charge of his court officials,<a name="fnB13" href="dan_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> to bring some of the Israelites who were of royal and noble descent-- 
<bqverse 4>4  young men in whom there was no physical defect and who were attractive, learned in all kinds of wisdom, well-educated and having keen insight, and who had the potential of entering the king's royal service<a name="fnB14" href="dan_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a>--and to teach them the literature and language<a name="fnB15" href="dan_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> of the Chaldeans.<a name="fnB16" href="dan_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  So the king assigned them a daily ration from his royal delicacies and from the wine he himself drank as their allotment for the next three years. At the end of that time they were to enter the king's service. 
<bqverse 6>6  As it turned out, among these young men<a name="fnB17" href="dan_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> were some from Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.<a name="fnB18" href="dan_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  But the overseer of the court officials renamed them. He gave<a name="fnB19" href="dan_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> Daniel the name Belteshazzar, Hannaniah he named Shadrach, Mishael he named Meshach, and Azariah he named Abednego.<a name="fnB20" href="dan_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 8>8  But Daniel made up his mind<a name="fnB21" href="dan_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> that he would not defile<a name="fnB22" href="dan_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> himself with the royal delicacies or the royal wine. He therefore requested the one who was in charge of the court officials for permission not to defile himself. 
<bqverse 9>9  Then God granted Daniel compassionate favor<a name="fnB23" href="dan_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> with the one who was in charge of the court officials. 
<bqverse 10>10  He<a name="fnB24" href="dan_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> responded to Daniel, "I fear my lord the king. He is the one who has decided your food and drink. Why should he later find your appearance more haggard than that of the other young men your age? If that happened, you would endanger my life<a name="fnB25" href="dan_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> with the king!" 
<bqverse 11>11  Daniel replied to the warden whom the chief of the court officials had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: 
<bqverse 12>12  "Please test us<a name="fnB26" href="dan_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> for ten days and provide us with some vegetables to eat and water to drink. 
<bqverse 13>13  When we appear before you along with the young men who are eating the royal delicacies, deal with us in light of what you see." 
<bqverse 14>14  So the warden<a name="fnB27" href="dan_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> listened to them in this matter and tested them for ten days.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  At the end of the ten days their appearance was better and their bodies healthier than all the young men who had been eating the royal delicacies. 
<bqverse 16>16  So the warden removed their delicacies and the wine from their diet and gave them a diet of vegetables instead. 
<bqverse 17>17  Now as for these four young men, God endowed them with knowledge and skill in all sorts of literature and wisdom--and Daniel had insight into all kinds of visions and dreams. <p>

<bqverse 18>18  At the end of the time that the king had specified for them to reappear,<a name="fnB28" href="dan_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> the chief of the court officials brought them into Nebuchadnezzar's presence. 
<bqverse 19>19  When the king spoke with them, he did not find among the entire group anyone like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, or Azariah. So they entered the king's service. 
<bqverse 20>20  And in every matter of wisdom and<a name="fnB29" href="dan_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> insight the king asked them about, he found them to be ten times<a name="fnB30" href="dan_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> better than any of the magicians and astrologers that were in his entire empire. 
<bqverse 21>21  Now Daniel lived on until the first<a name="fnB31" href="dan_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> year of Cyrus the king.
<bqchapter 2>
<a name="_Toc494012859"></a></p>
<p><i>Nebuchadnezzar Has a Disturbing Dream</i>
<p><A NAME="2"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> In the second year of his<a name="fnB32" href="dan_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> reign Nebuchadnezzar was in a dream state.<a name="fnB33" href="dan_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> His mind<a name="fnB34" href="dan_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> was disturbed and he suffered from insomnia.<a name="fnB35" href="dan_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  The king issued an order<a name="fnB36" href="dan_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> to summon the magicians, conjurers, sorcerers, and Chaldeans<a name="fnB37" href="dan_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> in order to explain his dreams to him.<a name="fnB38" href="dan_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> So they came and awaited the king's instructions.<a name="fnB39" href="dan_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 3>3 The king told them, "I have had a dream,<a name="fnB40" href="dan_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> and I<a name="fnB41" href="dan_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> am anxious to understand the dream." 
<bqverse 4>4  The Chaldeans replied to the king, [in Aramaic<a name="fnB42" href="dan_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a>] "O king, live forever! Tell us<a name="fnB43" href="dan_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> the dream, and we will disclose its interpretation." 
<bqverse 5>5  The king replied<a name="fnB44" href="dan_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> to the Chaldeans, "My decision is firm.<a name="fnB45" href="dan_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> If you do not inform me of the dream and its interpretation as well, you will be dismembered and your homes reduced to rubble! 
<bqverse 6>6  But if you declare the dream and its interpretation, you will receive from me gifts, a reward, and considerable honor. So declare to me the dream and its interpretation!" 
<bqverse 7>7  They again replied, "Let the king inform us of the dream; then we will disclose its interpretation." 
<bqverse 8>8  The king answered, "I know for sure that you are attempting to gain time, because you see that my decision is firm. 
<bqverse 9>9  If you don't inform me of the dream, there is only one thing that is going to happen to you.<a name="fnB46" href="dan_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> For you have agreed among yourselves to report to me something false and deceitful until such time as things might change. So tell me the dream, and I will have confidence<a name="fnB47" href="dan_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> that you can declare its interpretation."<p>

<bqverse 10>10  The Chaldeans answered the king, "There is no man on earth who is able to declare the king's matter, for no king, regardless of his position and power, has ever requested something like this from any magician, conjurer, or Chaldean. 
<bqverse 11>11  What the king is asking is difficult, and no one exists who can declare it to the king, except for the gods--but they don't live among mortals!"<a name="fnB48" href="dan_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 12>12  Because of this the king got furiously angry<a name="fnB49" href="dan_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. 
<bqverse 13>13  So a decree went out, and the wise men were about<a name="fnB50" href="dan_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> to be executed. And Daniel and his friends were sought<a name="fnB51" href="dan_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> so that they could be executed.<p>

<bqverse 14>14  Then Daniel spoke with prudent counsel<a name="fnB52" href="dan_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> to Arioch, who was in charge of the king's executioners and who had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon. 
<bqverse 15>15  He inquired of the king's deputy,<a name="fnB53" href="dan_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> "Why is the decree from the king so urgent?"<a name="fnB54" href="dan_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> Then Arioch informed Daniel about the matter. 
<bqverse 16>16  So Daniel went in and<a name="fnB55" href="dan_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> requested the king to grant him time, that he might declare the interpretation to the king. 
<bqverse 17>17  Then Daniel went to his home and informed his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah of the matter, 
<bqverse 18>18  and asked them to pray for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he<a name="fnB56" href="dan_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> and his friends would not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. 
<bqverse 19>19  Then in a night vision the mystery was revealed to Daniel. So Daniel blessed the God of heaven, saying,</p>

<bqverse 20>20 <br>"Let the name of God<a name="fnB57" href="dan_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> <br>
be blessed forever and ever,<br>
for wisdom and power belong to him.<br>

<bqverse 21>21  He changes times and seasons,<br>
deposing some kings <br>
and establishing others.<br>
He gives wisdom to the wise;<br>
he imparts knowledge to those with understanding;<br>

<bqverse 22>22  he reveals deep and hidden things.<br>
He knows what is in the darkness,<br>
and light resides with him.<br>

<bqverse 23>23  O God of my fathers, I acknowledge and glorify you,<br>
for you have bestowed wisdom and power on me.<br>
Now you have enabled me to understand what I<a name="fnB58" href="dan_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> requested from you.<br>
For you have enabled me to understand the king's dilemma."</ul><p>
<bqverse 24>24  Then Daniel went in to see<a name="fnB59" href="dan_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> to Arioch (whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon). He came<a name="fnB60" href="dan_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> and said to him, "Don't destroy the wise men of Babylon! Escort me to the king, and I will declare the interpretation to him!"<a name="fnB61" href="dan_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 25>25  So Arioch quickly ushered Daniel in before the king and said to him, "I<a name="fnB62" href="dan_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> have found a man from the captives of Judah who can disclose the interpretation to the king." 
<bqverse 26>26  The king then asked Daniel (whose name was also Belteshazzar), "Are you able to disclose the dream that I saw, as well as its interpretation?" 
<bqverse 27>27  Daniel replied to the king, "The mystery that the king is asking about is such that no wise men, conjurers, magicians, or astrologers are able to declare it to the king. 
<bqverse 28>28  However, there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has informed king Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the latter times.<a name="fnB63" href="dan_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> The dream and the visions of your mind while you lay on your bed are as follows.<p>

<bqverse 29>29  "As for you, O king, while you were lying on your bed your thoughts turned to future things. The revealer of mysteries has disclosed to you what will take place. 
<bqverse 30>30  But for my part, this mystery was revealed to me not because I possess more wisdom<a name="fnB64" href="dan_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> than in any other living person, but so that the king may understand the interpretation and comprehend the thoughts of your mind.<a name="fnB65" href="dan_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 31>31  "You, O king, were watching as a great statue--one<a name="fnB66" href="dan_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> of impressive size and appearance--was standing before you. Its brightness caused alarm. 
<bqverse 32>32  As for that statue, its head was of fine gold, its chest and arms were of silver, its belly and thighs were of bronze. 
<bqverse 33>33  Its legs were of iron; its feet were partly of iron and partly of clay.<a name="fnB67" href="dan_note.htm#fn67"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 34>34  You were watching as a stone was cut out<a name="fnB68" href="dan_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> without human hands. It struck the statue on its iron and clay feet, breaking them in pieces. 
<bqverse 35>35  Then the iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold were broken in pieces and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors that the wind carries away. Not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the statue became a large mountain that filled the entire earth. 
<bqverse 36>36  This was the dream. Now we<a name="fnB69" href="dan_note.htm#fn69"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> will set forth before the king its interpretation.<a name="_Toc494012860"></a></p>
<p><i>Daniel Interprets Nebuchadnezzar's Dream</i>
<p>
<bqverse 37>37  "You, O king, are a king of kings. The God of heaven has granted to you sovereignty, power, strength, and honor. 
<bqverse 38>38  Wherever human beings,<a name="fnB70" href="dan_note.htm#fn70"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> wild animals,<a name="fnB71" href="dan_note.htm#fn71"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> and birds of the sky live--he has given them into your power.<a name="fnB72" href="dan_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> He has given you authority over them all. You are the head of gold. 
<bqverse 39>39  Now after you there will arise another kingdom,<a name="fnB73" href="dan_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> one inferior to yours. Then a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule in all the earth. 
<bqverse 40>40  Then there will be a fourth kingdom, one like iron. Just like iron breaks in pieces and shatters everything, and as iron breaks in pieces<a name="fnB74" href="dan_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> all of these metals, so it will break in pieces and crush the others.<a name="fnB75" href="dan_note.htm#fn75"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 41>41  In that you were seeing feet and toes<a name="fnB76" href="dan_note.htm#fn76"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> partly of wet<a name="fnB77" href="dan_note.htm#fn77"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom. Some of the strength of iron will be in it, for you saw iron mixed with wet clay.<a name="fnB78" href="dan_note.htm#fn78"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 42>42  In that the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, the latter stages of this kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile. 
<bqverse 43>43  And<a name="fnB79" href="dan_note.htm#fn79"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> in that you saw iron mixed with wet clay, so people will be mixed<a name="fnB80" href="dan_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> with one another<a name="fnB81" href="dan_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> without adhering to one another, just as<a name="fnB82" href="dan_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> iron does not mix with clay. 
<bqverse 44>44  In the days of those kings the God of heaven will raise up an everlasting kingdom that will not be destroyed and a kingdom that will not be left to another people. It will break in pieces and bring about the demise of all these kingdoms. But it will stand forever. 
<bqverse 45>45  In that you saw that a stone was cut without human hands from a mountain and smashed the iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold into pieces, the great God has disclosed to the king what will occur after the present time.<a name="fnB83" href="dan_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> The dream is certain, and its interpretation is reliable."<p>
	
<bqverse 46>46  Then king Nebuchadnezzar bowed down with his face to the ground<a name="fnB84" href="dan_note.htm#fn84"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> and worshiped Daniel. He gave orders to offer sacrifice and incense to him. 
<bqverse 47>47  The king replied to Daniel, "Certainly your God is a God of gods and Lord of kings and revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this mystery!" 
<bqverse 48>48  Then the king elevated Daniel to high position and bestowed on him many marvelous gifts. He granted him authority over the entire province of Babylon and made him the main prefect over all the wise men of Babylon. 
<bqverse 49>49  And at Daniel's request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the administration of the province of Babylon. Daniel himself served in the king's court.<a name="fnB85" href="dan_note.htm#fn85"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Daniel's Friends Are Tested</i>
<p><A NAME="3"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b><a name="fnB86" href="dan_note.htm#fn86"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> King Nebuchadnezzar had a golden<a name="fnB87" href="dan_note.htm#fn87"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> statue made.<a name="fnB88" href="dan_note.htm#fn88"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> It was ninety feet<a name="fnB89" href="dan_note.htm#fn89"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> tall and nine feet<a name="fnB90" href="dan_note.htm#fn90"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> wide. He erected it on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. 
<bqverse 2>2  Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent out a summons to assemble the satraps, prefects, governors, counselors, treasurers, judges, magistrates,<a name="fnB91" href="dan_note.htm#fn91"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> and all the other authorities of the province to attend the dedication of the statue that he<a name="fnB92" href="dan_note.htm#fn92"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> had erected. 
<bqverse 3>3  So the satraps, prefects, governors, counselors, treasurers, judges, magistrates,<b> </b>and all the other provincial authorities assembled for the dedication of the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had erected. They were standing in front of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar had erected.<a name="fnB93" href="dan_note.htm#fn93"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 4>4  Then the herald<a name="fnB94" href="dan_note.htm#fn94"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> made a loud<a name="fnB95" href="dan_note.htm#fn95"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> proclamation: "To you, O peoples, nations, and language groups, the following command is given: 
<bqverse 5>5  When you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither,<a name="fnB96" href="dan_note.htm#fn96"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> trigon, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music<b>,</b> you must<a name="fnB97" href="dan_note.htm#fn97"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> bow down to the ground and worship the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has erected. 
<bqverse 6>6  Whoever does not bow down and worship will immediately be thrown right into the middle of a furnace of blazing fire!" 
<bqverse 7>7  Therefore when they all<a name="fnB98" href="dan_note.htm#fn98"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, trigon, harp, pipes,<sup><sub> </sub></sup><a name="fnB99" href="dan_note.htm#fn99"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> and all kinds of music<b>, </b>all the peoples, nations, and language-groups began bowing down to the ground and worshiping the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had erected.<p>

<bqverse 8>8  In light of this,<a name="fnB100" href="dan_note.htm#fn100"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and brought malicious accusations against<a name="fnB101" href="dan_note.htm#fn101"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> the Jews. 
<bqverse 9>9  They said<a name="fnB102" href="dan_note.htm#fn102"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> to King Nebuchadnezzar, "O king, live forever!<a name="fnB103" href="dan_note.htm#fn103"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  You have issued an edict, O king, that everyone<b> </b>must bow down to the ground and worship the golden statue when they hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, trigon, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music<b> </b>. 
<bqverse 11>11  And whoever does not bow down and worship, must be thrown into the middle of a furnace of blazing fire. 
<bqverse 12>12  But there are Jewish men whom you appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon--Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego--and these men<a name="fnB104" href="dan_note.htm#fn104"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> have not shown proper respect to you, O king. They don't serve your gods and they don't worship the golden statue that you have erected."<p>

<bqverse 13>13  Then Nebuchadnezzar in a fit of rage<a name="fnB105" href="dan_note.htm#fn105"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> demanded that they bring<a name="fnB106" href="dan_note.htm#fn106"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego before him. So they brought them before the king. 
<bqverse 14>14  Nebuchadnezzar said to them, "Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you don't serve my gods and that you don't worship the golden statue that I erected?" 
<bqverse 15>15  Now if you are ready, when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, trigon, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music<b>, </b>you must bow down and worship the statue that I had made. If you don't worship it, you will immediately be thrown into the middle of the furnace of blazing fire. Now, who is that god who can rescue you from my power?"<a name="fnB107" href="dan_note.htm#fn107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied to King Nebuchadnezzar,<a name="fnB108" href="dan_note.htm#fn108"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> "We do not need to give you a reply<a name="fnB109" href="dan_note.htm#fn109"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> concerning this. 
<bqverse 17>17  If<a name="fnB110" href="dan_note.htm#fn110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> our God whom we are serving exists,<a name="fnB111" href="dan_note.htm#fn111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> he is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing fire, and he will deliver us, O king, from your power as well. 
<bqverse 18>18  But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we don't serve your gods, and we will not worship the golden statue that you have erected." <p>

<bqverse 19>19  Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with rage, and his disposition changed<a name="fnB112" href="dan_note.htm#fn112"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He gave orders to heat the furnace seven times hotter than it was normally heated. 
<bqverse 20>20  He ordered strong<a name="fnB113" href="dan_note.htm#fn113"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and to throw them into the furnace of blazing fire. 
<bqverse 21>21  Then those men were bound, while still wearing their mantles, trousers, turbans, and other clothes,<a name="fnB114" href="dan_note.htm#fn114"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> and were thrown into the middle of the furnace of blazing fire. 
<bqverse 22>22  But since the king's command was so urgent, and the furnace was so excessively hot, the men who escorted<a name="fnB115" href="dan_note.htm#fn115"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were killed<a name="fnB116" href="dan_note.htm#fn116"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> by the fiery flame. 
<bqverse 23>23  But those three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell right into the middle of the furnace of blazing fire while securely bound.<a name="fnB117" href="dan_note.htm#fn117"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494012862"></a></p>
<p><i>God Delivers His Servants</i>
<p>
<bqverse 24>24  Then King Nebuchadnezzar was startled and quickly got up. He said to his ministers, "Wasn't it three men that we tied up and threw into<a name="fnB118" href="dan_note.htm#fn118"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> the fire?" They replied to the king, "For sure, O king." 
<bqverse 25>25  He answered, "But I see four men, untied and walking around in the middle of the fire! No harm has come to them! And the appearance of the fourth is like that of a god!"<a name="fnB119" href="dan_note.htm#fn119"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the furnace of blazing fire. He called out, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the most high God, come out! Come here!" <p>
Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire. 
<bqverse 27>27  Once the satraps, prefects, governors, and counselors of the king had gathered around, they saw that those men were physically<a name="fnB120" href="dan_note.htm#fn120"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> unharmed by the fire. The hair of their heads was not singed, nor were their trousers damaged. Not even the smell of fire was to be found on them!<p>

<bqverse 28>28  Nebuchadnezzar exclaimed,<a name="fnB121" href="dan_note.htm#fn121"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent forth his angel and has delivered his servants who trusted in him, ignoring the edict of the king and giving up their bodies rather than<a name="fnB122" href="dan_note.htm#fn122"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> serve or worship any god other than their God! 
<bqverse 29>29  I hereby decree<a name="fnB123" href="dan_note.htm#fn123"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> that any people, nation, or language group that utters calumny against the god of Shadrach, Meshach, or Abednego will be dismembered and his home reduced to rubble. For there exists no other god who can deliver in this way." 
<bqverse 30>30  Then Nebuchadnezzar<a name="fnB124" href="dan_note.htm#fn124"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.<p>

<p>
<bqverse 4>4 <i>(4.1)</i><a name="fnB127" href="dan_note.htm#fn127"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my home,<a name="fnB128" href="dan_note.htm#fn128"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> living luxuriously in my palace. 
<bqverse 5>5  I saw a dream that scared me. The things I imagined while lying on my bed--these visions of my mind--were terrifying me. 
<bqverse 6>6  So I issued an order<a name="fnB129" href="dan_note.htm#fn129"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> for all the wise men of Babylon to be brought<a name="fnB130" href="dan_note.htm#fn130"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> before me so that they could disclose to me the interpretation of the dream. 
<bqverse 7>7  When the magicians, conjurers, Chaldeans, and astrologers entered, I recounted the dream for them. But they were unable to disclose its interpretation to me. 
<bqverse 8>8  Later Daniel entered (whose name is Belteshazzar after the name of my god,<a name="fnB131" href="dan_note.htm#fn131"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> and in whom there is a spirit of the holy gods). I recounted the dream for him as well, 
<bqverse 9>9  saying, "Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, in whom I know there to be a spirit of the holy gods and whom no mystery baffles, consider<a name="fnB132" href="dan_note.htm#fn132"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> my dream that I saw and set forth its interpretation! 
<bqverse 10>10  Here are the visions of my mind<a name="fnB133" href="dan_note.htm#fn133"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> while I was on my bed. While I was watching,</p>
<br>there was a tree in the middle of the land.<a name="fnB134" href="dan_note.htm#fn134"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a><br>
It was enormously tall.<br>

<bqverse 11>11  The tree grew large and strong.<br>
Its top reached far into the sky;<br>
it could be seen<a name="fnB135" href="dan_note.htm#fn135"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> from the borders of all the land.<a name="fnB136" href="dan_note.htm#fn136"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 12>12  Its foliage was attractive and its fruit plentiful;<br>
on it there was food enough for all.<br>
Under it the wild animals<a name="fnB137" href="dan_note.htm#fn137"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> used to seek shade,<br>
and in its branches the birds of the sky used to nest.<br>
All creatures<a name="fnB138" href="dan_note.htm#fn138"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> used to feed themselves from it.<br>

<bqverse 13>13  While I was watching in my mind's visions on my bed,<br>
a holy watcher<a name="fnB139" href="dan_note.htm#fn139"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> came down from heaven.<br>

<bqverse 14>14  He called out loudly<a name="fnB140" href="dan_note.htm#fn140"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> as follows:<a name="fnB141" href="dan_note.htm#fn141"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a><br>
`Chop down the tree and lop off its branches!<br>
Strip off its foliage<br>
and scatter its fruit!<br>
Let the animals flee from under it<br>
and the birds from its branches!<br>

<bqverse 15>15  But leave the stump and its taproot<a name="fnB142" href="dan_note.htm#fn142"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a><br>
in the ground,<br>
with a band of iron and bronze around it<a name="fnB143" href="dan_note.htm#fn143"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> <br>
surrounded by the grass of the field.<br>
Let him become damp with the dew of the sky,<br>
and let his lot be with the animals in the grass of the land.<br>

<bqverse 16>16  Let his mind<a name="fnB144" href="dan_note.htm#fn144"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> be altered from that of a human being,<br>
and let an animal's mind be given to him,<br>
and let seven periods of time<a name="fnB145" href="dan_note.htm#fn145"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> go by for<a name="fnB146" href="dan_note.htm#fn146"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> him.<br>

<bqverse 17>17  This announcement is by the decree of the watchers;<br>
this decision is by the pronouncement of the holy ones, <br>
so that those who are alive may understand <br>
that the Most High has authority over human kingdoms, <br>
and he bestows them on whomever he wishes.<br>
He establishes over them even the lowliest of human beings.'</ul><p>
<bqverse 18>18  "This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw. Now you, Belteshazzar, declare its<a name="fnB147" href="dan_note.htm#fn147"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> interpretation, for none of the wise men in my kingdom are able to declare to me the interpretation. But you can do so, for a spirit of the holy gods is in you." <p>

<bqverse 19>19  Then Daniel (whose name is also Belteshazzar) was briefly<a name="fnB148" href="dan_note.htm#fn148"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> appalled; his thoughts were alarming him. The king said, "Belteshazzar, don't let the dream and its interpretation alarm you." But Belteshazzar replied, "Sir,<a name="fnB149" href="dan_note.htm#fn149"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> if only the dream were for your enemies and its interpretation applied to your adversaries! 
<bqverse 20>20  The tree that you saw that grew large and strong, whose top reached to the sky, and which could be seen in all the land, 
<bqverse 21>21  whose foliage was attractive and its fruit plentiful, and from which there was food available for all, under whose branches wild animals<a name="fnB150" href="dan_note.htm#fn150"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> used to live, and in whose branches birds of the sky used to nest-- 
<bqverse 22>22  it is you,<a name="fnB151" href="dan_note.htm#fn151"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> O king! For you have become great and strong. Your greatness is such that it reaches to heaven, your authority to the ends of the earth. 
<bqverse 23>23  As for the king seeing a holy watcher<a name="fnB152" href="dan_note.htm#fn152"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> coming down from heaven and saying, `Chop down the tree and destroy it. But leave the stump and its taproot in the ground, with a band of iron and bronze around it, surrounded by the grass of the field. Let him become damp with the dew of the sky, and let his lot be with the wild animals, until seven times go by for him'-- <a name="_Toc494012864"></a></p>
<p><i>Daniel Interprets Nebuchadnezzar's Dream</i>
<p>
<bqverse 24>24  "This is the interpretation, O king. It is the decision of the Most High that this has happened to my lord the king. 
<bqverse 25>25  You will be driven<a name="fnB153" href="dan_note.htm#fn153"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> from human society,<a name="fnB154" href="dan_note.htm#fn154"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> and you will live with the wild animals. You will be fed<a name="fnB155" href="dan_note.htm#fn155"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> grass like oxen,<a name="fnB156" href="dan_note.htm#fn156"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> and you will become damp with the dew of the sky. Seven times will pass by for you, before<a name="fnB157" href="dan_note.htm#fn157"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> you understand that the Most High is ruler over human kingdoms and gives them to whomever he wishes. 
<bqverse 26>26  Now in that they said to leave a taproot of the tree, your kingdom will be restored to you when you come to understand that heaven<a name="fnB158" href="dan_note.htm#fn158"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> rules. 
<bqverse 27>27  Therefore, O king, may my advice<a name="fnB159" href="dan_note.htm#fn159"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> be pleasing to you. Break away from your sins by doing acts of righteousness, and from your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor. Perhaps your prosperity will be prolonged."<p>

<bqverse 28>28  Now all of this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar. 
<bqverse 29>29  After twelve months, he happened to be walking around on top of the walls<a name="fnB160" href="dan_note.htm#fn160"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> of the royal palace of Babylon. 
<bqverse 30>30  The king uttered these words: "Is this not the great Babylon that I have built for a royal residence<a name="fnB161" href="dan_note.htm#fn161"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> by my own mighty strength<a name="fnB162" href="dan_note.htm#fn162"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> and for my majestic honor?" 
<bqverse 31>31  While these words were still on the king's lips,<a name="fnB163" href="dan_note.htm#fn163"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> a voice came down from heaven: "It is hereby announced to you, King Nebuchadnezzar, that your kingdom has been removed from you! 
<bqverse 32>32  You will be driven from human society, and you will live with the wild animals. You will be fed grass like oxen, and seven times will pass by for you before<a name="fnB164" href="dan_note.htm#fn164"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> you understand that the Most High is ruler over human kingdoms and gives them to whomever he wishes." <p>

<bqverse 33>33  Now in that very moment<a name="fnB165" href="dan_note.htm#fn165"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> this pronouncement came true<a name="fnB166" href="dan_note.htm#fn166"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> with Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven from human society, he ate grass like oxen, and his body became damp with the dew of the sky, until his hair became long like an eagle's feathers, and his nails like a bird's claws. <p>

<bqverse 34>34  But at the end of the appointed time<a name="fnB167" href="dan_note.htm#fn167"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up<a name="fnB168" href="dan_note.htm#fn168"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> toward heaven, and my sanity returned to me.</p>
<br>I blessed the Most High, <br>
and I praised and glorified the one who lives forever. <br>
For his rule is an everlasting rule, <br>
and his kingdom extends from one generation to the next.<br>

<bqverse 35>35 All the inhabitants of the earth are regarded as nothing.<a name="fnB169" href="dan_note.htm#fn169"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a><br>
He does as he wishes with the army of heaven<br>
and with those who inhabit the earth.<br>
No one slaps<a name="fnB170" href="dan_note.htm#fn170"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> his hand<br>
and says to him, `What have you done?'</ul><p>
<bqverse 36>36  At that time my sanity returned to me. I was restored<a name="fnB171" href="dan_note.htm#fn171"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> to the honor of my kingdom<b>,</b> and my splendor returned to me. My ministers and my magistrates were seeking me out, and I was reinstated<a name="fnB172" href="dan_note.htm#fn172"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> over my kingdom. Tremendous greatness was restored to me, greater than before. 
<bqverse 37>37  Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, for all his deeds are right and his ways are just. He is able to bring low those who live<a name="fnB173" href="dan_note.htm#fn173"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> in pride.

<bqverse 6>6  Then all the color drained from the king's face<a name="fnB186" href="dan_note.htm#fn186"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> and his thoughts were alarming him. The joints of his hips gave way,<a name="fnB187" href="dan_note.htm#fn187"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> and his knees began knocking together. 
<bqverse 7>7  The king called out loudly to summon the astrologers, Chaldeans, and sorcerers. The king proclaimed to the wise men of Babylon that anyone who could read this inscription and declare its interpretation would be clothed in purple<a name="fnB188" href="dan_note.htm#fn188"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> and have a golden collar<a name="fnB189" href="dan_note.htm#fn189"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> placed on his neck and be third ruler in the kingdom.<p>

<bqverse 8>8  So all the king's wise men came in, but they were unable to read the writing or to declare its<a name="fnB190" href="dan_note.htm#fn190"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> interpretation to the king. 
<bqverse 9>9  Then King Belshazzar was very terrified, and he was visibly shaken.<a name="fnB191" href="dan_note.htm#fn191"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> His nobles were completely dumbfounded.<p>

<bqverse 10>10  Due to the noise caused by the king and his nobles, the queen mother<a name="fnB192" href="dan_note.htm#fn192"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> then entered the banquet room. She<a name="fnB193" href="dan_note.htm#fn193"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> said, "O king, live forever! Don't let your thoughts terrify you! Don't be shaken! 
<bqverse 11>11  There is a man in your kingdom who has a spirit of the holy gods within him. In the days of Nebuchadnezzar your father, he was discovered to possess<a name="fnB194" href="dan_note.htm#fn194"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> illumination, insight, and wisdom like that<a name="fnB195" href="dan_note.htm#fn195"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> of the gods.<a name="fnB196" href="dan_note.htm#fn196"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> King Nebuchadnezzar your father appointed him chief of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and sorcerers.<a name="fnB197" href="dan_note.htm#fn197"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  Thus there was found in this man Daniel, whom the king renamed Belteshazzar, an extraordinary spirit, knowledge, and skill to interpret<a name="fnB198" href="dan_note.htm#fn198"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> dreams, solve riddles, and decipher knotty problems. Now summon<a name="fnB199" href="dan_note.htm#fn199"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> Daniel, and he will declare the interpretation." <p>

<bqverse 13>13  So Daniel was brought in before the king. The king said to Daniel, "Are you that Daniel who is one of the captives of Judah, whom my father the king brought from Judah? 
<bqverse 14>14  I have heard about you, how there is a spirit of the gods in you, and how illumination, insight, and extraordinary wisdom have been found in you. 
<bqverse 15>15  Now the wise men and astrologers were brought before me to read this writing and declare to me its interpretation. But they were unable to declare the interpretation of the matter. 
<bqverse 16>16  However, I have heard that you are able to provide interpretations and to solve knotty problems. Now if you are able to read this writing and declare to me its interpretation, you will wear purple and have a golden collar around your neck and be third<a name="fnB200" href="dan_note.htm#fn200"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> ruler in the kingdom."<a name="_Toc494012866"></a></p>
<p><i>Daniel Interprets the Handwriting on the Wall</i>
<p>
<bqverse 17>17  But Daniel replied to the king, "Keep your gifts and give your rewards to someone else. However, I will read the writing for the king and declare its interpretation. 
<bqverse 18>18  As for you, O king, the most high God bestowed on Nebuchadnezzar your father a kingdom, greatness, honor, and majesty.<a name="fnB201" href="dan_note.htm#fn201"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  Due to the greatness that he bestowed on him, all peoples, nations, and language groups were trembling with fear<a name="fnB202" href="dan_note.htm#fn202"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> before him. He killed whom he wished, he let live<a name="fnB203" href="dan_note.htm#fn203"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> whom he wished, he exalted whom he wished, and he brought low whom he wished. 
<bqverse 20>20  And when his mind became arrogant<a name="fnB204" href="dan_note.htm#fn204"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> and his spirit filled with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne and his honor was removed from him. 
<bqverse 21>21  He was driven from human society, his mind<a name="fnB205" href="dan_note.htm#fn205"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> was changed to that of an animal, he lived with the wild donkeys, he was fed grass like oxen, and his body became damp with the dew of the sky, until he came to understand that the most high God rules over human kingdoms, and he appoints over them whomever he wishes.<p>

<bqverse 22>22  "But you, his son<a name="fnB206" href="dan_note.htm#fn206"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> Belshazzar, have not humbled yourself,<a name="fnB207" href="dan_note.htm#fn207"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> although you knew all this. 
<bqverse 23>23  Instead, you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven. You had brought before you the vessels from his temple, and you and your nobles, together with your wives and concubines, were drinking wine from them. You glorified the gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone--gods that cannot see or hear or comprehend! But you have not glorified the God who has in his control<a name="fnB208" href="dan_note.htm#fn208"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> your very breath and all your ways! 
<bqverse 24>24  Therefore the palm of a hand was sent from him, and this writing was inscribed. <p>

<bqverse 25>25  "This is the writing that was inscribed: MENE'<i>, </i>MENE'<i>,</i><a name="fnB209" href="dan_note.htm#fn209"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a><i> </i>TEQEL<i>,</i> and PHARSIN.<a name="fnB210" href="dan_note.htm#fn210"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  This is the interpretation of the words: As for <i>mene'</i><a name="fnB211" href="dan_note.htm#fn211"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a>--God has numbered your kingdom's days and brought it to an end. 
<bqverse 27>27  As for <i>teqel</i>--you are weighed on the balances and found to be lacking. 
<bqverse 28>28  As for <i>peres</i><a name="fnB212" href="dan_note.htm#fn212"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a>--your kingdom is divided and given over to the Medes and Persians."<p>

<bqverse 29>29  Then, on Belshazzar's orders, Daniel was clothed in purple, a golden collar was placed around his neck, and he was proclaimed third ruler in the kingdom. 
<bqverse 30>30  And in that very night Belshazzar, the Babylonian king,<a name="fnB213" href="dan_note.htm#fn213"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> was killed.<a name="fnB214" href="dan_note.htm#fn214"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 31>31 <i>(6.1)</i><a name="fnB215" href="dan_note.htm#fn215"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> So Darius the Mede took control of the kingdom at about sixty-two years of age. 
<bqchapter 6>
<a name="_Toc494012867"></a></p>
<p><i>Daniel is Cast into a Lions' Den</i>
<p><A NAME="6"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> It seemed like a good idea to Darius to appoint over the kingdom one hundred twenty satraps who would be in charge of the whole kingdom. 
<bqverse 2>2  Over them would be three supervisors, one of whom was Daniel. These satraps were to be accountable to them, so that the king's interests might not incur damage. 
<bqverse 3>3  Now this Daniel was distinguishing himself above the other supervisors and the satraps, for he had an extraordinary spirit. In fact, the king intended to appoint him over the entire kingdom. 
<bqverse 4>4  Consequently the supervisors and satraps were trying to find<a name="fnB216" href="dan_note.htm#fn216"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> some pretext against Daniel in connection with administrative matters.<a name="fnB217" href="dan_note.htm#fn217"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> But they were unable to find any such damaging pretext, because he was trustworthy and guilty of no negligence or corruption.<a name="fnB218" href="dan_note.htm#fn218"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  So these men concluded,<a name="fnB219" href="dan_note.htm#fn219"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> "We won't find any pretext against this man Daniel unless it is<a name="fnB220" href="dan_note.htm#fn220"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> in connection with the law of his God."<p>

<bqverse 6>6  So these supervisors and satraps came by collusion<a name="fnB221" href="dan_note.htm#fn221"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> to the king and said<a name="fnB222" href="dan_note.htm#fn222"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> to him, "O King Darius, live forever! 
<bqverse 7>7  To all the supervisors of the kingdom, the prefects, satraps, counselors, and governors it seemed like a good idea for a royal edict to be issued and an interdict to be enforced that for the next thirty days anyone who prays<a name="fnB223" href="dan_note.htm#fn223"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> to any god or human other than you, O king, should be thrown into a den of lions. 
<bqverse 8>8  Now let the king establish a written interdict<a name="fnB224" href="dan_note.htm#fn224"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> so that it cannot to be altered, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be changed. 
<bqverse 9>9  So King Darius issued the written interdict.<p>

<bqverse 10>10  When Daniel realized<a name="fnB225" href="dan_note.htm#fn225"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> that a written decree had been issued, he entered his home, where the windows<a name="fnB226" href="dan_note.htm#fn226"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> in his upper room opened toward Jerusalem.<a name="fnB227" href="dan_note.htm#fn227"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> Three<a name="fnB228" href="dan_note.htm#fn228"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> times daily he was<a name="fnB229" href="dan_note.htm#fn229"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> kneeling<a name="fnB230" href="dan_note.htm#fn230"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> and offering prayers and thanks to his God just as he had been accustomed to do previously. 
<bqverse 11>11  Then those officials who had gone to the king<a name="fnB231" href="dan_note.htm#fn231"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> came by collusion and found Daniel praying and asking for help before his God. 
<bqverse 12>12  So they approached the king and said to him,<a name="fnB232" href="dan_note.htm#fn232"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> "Did you not inscribe an edict to the effect that for the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or human other than to you, O king, would be thrown into a den of lions?" The king replied, "That is correct,<a name="fnB233" href="dan_note.htm#fn233"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be changed." 
<bqverse 13>13  Then they said to the king, "Daniel, who is one of the captives<a name="fnB234" href="dan_note.htm#fn234"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the edict you inscribed. Three times daily he offers his prayer."<p>

<bqverse 14>14  When the king heard this, he was very displeased and began thinking about<a name="fnB235" href="dan_note.htm#fn235"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> how he might rescue Daniel. Until late afternoon<a name="fnB236" href="dan_note.htm#fn236"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> he was struggling to find a way to rescue him. 
<bqverse 15>15  Then those men came by collusion to the king and<a name="fnB237" href="dan_note.htm#fn237"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> said to him,<a name="fnB238" href="dan_note.htm#fn238"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> "Recall,<a name="fnB239" href="dan_note.htm#fn239"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no edict or decree that the king issues can be changed." 
<bqverse 16>16  So the king gave the order,<a name="fnB240" href="dan_note.htm#fn240"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> and Daniel was brought and thrown into a den<a name="fnB241" href="dan_note.htm#fn241"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> of lions. The king consoled<a name="fnB242" href="dan_note.htm#fn242"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> Daniel by saying, "Your God whom you continually serve will deliver you!" 
<bqverse 17>17  Then a stone was brought and placed over the opening<a name="fnB243" href="dan_note.htm#fn243"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> to the den. The king sealed<a name="fnB244" href="dan_note.htm#fn244"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> it with his signet ring and with those<a name="fnB245" href="dan_note.htm#fn245"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> of his nobles so that nothing could be changed with regard to Daniel. 
<bqverse 18>18  Then the king departed to his palace. But he spent the night without eating, and no diversions<a name="fnB246" href="dan_note.htm#fn246"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> were brought to him. He was unable to sleep.<a name="fnB247" href="dan_note.htm#fn247"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494012868"></a></p>
<p><i>God Rescues Daniel from the Lions</i>
<p>
<bqverse 19>19  In the morning, at the earliest sign of daylight, the king got up and rushed quickly to the lions' den. 
<bqverse 20>20  As he approached the den, he called out to Daniel in a worried voice,<a name="fnB248" href="dan_note.htm#fn248"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> "Daniel, servant of the living God, was your God whom you continually serve able to deliver you from the lions?" <p>

<bqverse 21>21  Then Daniel spoke to the king, "O king, live forever! 
<bqverse 22>22  My God sent his angel and closed the lions' mouths so that they have not harmed me, because I was found to be innocent before him. Nor have I done any harm to you, O king."<p>

<bqverse 23>23  Then the king was very pleased and gave an order to haul Daniel up from the den. So Daniel was hauled up out of the den, and no injury of any kind was found on him, because he had trusted in his God. 
<bqverse 24>24  The king gave another order, and those men who had maliciously accused<a name="fnB249" href="dan_note.htm#fn249"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> Daniel were brought and thrown<a name="fnB250" href="dan_note.htm#fn250"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> into the lions' den--they, their children, and their wives.<a name="fnB251" href="dan_note.htm#fn251"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> They did not even reach the bottom of the den before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.<p>

<bqverse 25>25  Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and language groups who were living in all the land: "Best wishes! 
<bqverse 26>26  I have issued an edict that throughout all the dominion of my kingdom people reverence and fear the God of Daniel. </p>
<br>"For he is the living God;<br>
he endures forever.<br>
His kingdom is one that will not be destroyed;<br>
his authority is forever.<a name="fnB252" href="dan_note.htm#fn252"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 27>27  He saves and delivers <br>
and performs signs and wonders<br>
in the heavens and on the earth.<br>
He has saved Daniel from the power<a name="fnB253" href="dan_note.htm#fn253"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> of the lions."</ul><p>
<bqverse 28>28  So this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and<a name="fnB254" href="dan_note.htm#fn254"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

<p><i>Daniel has a Vision of Four Animals Coming up from the Sea</i>
<p><A NAME="7"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> In the first<a name="fnB255" href="dan_note.htm#fn255"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> year of King Belshazzar of Babylon, Daniel had a dream with mental visions<a name="fnB256" href="dan_note.htm#fn256"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> while he was lying on his bed. Then he wrote down the dream in summary fashion.<a name="fnB257" href="dan_note.htm#fn257"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  Daniel explained:<a name="fnB258" href="dan_note.htm#fn258"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> "I was watching in my vision during the night as the four winds of the sky<a name="fnB259" href="dan_note.htm#fn259"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> were stirring up the great sea.<a name="fnB260" href="dan_note.htm#fn260"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  Then four large beasts came up from the sea; they were different from one another.<p>

<bqverse 4>4  "The first one was like a lion with eagles' wings. As I watched, its wings were pulled off and it was lifted up from the ground. It was made to stand on two feet like a human being and a human mind<a name="fnB261" href="dan_note.htm#fn261"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> was given to it.<a name="fnB262" href="dan_note.htm#fn262"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 5>5  Then a second beast appeared, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and there were three ribs<a name="fnB263" href="dan_note.htm#fn263"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> in its mouth between its teeth.<a name="fnB264" href="dan_note.htm#fn264"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> It was told, `Get up and devour much flesh!' <p>

<bqverse 6>6  After these things, as I was watching, another beast like a leopard appeared, with four bird-like wings on its back.<a name="fnB265" href="dan_note.htm#fn265"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> This beast had four heads,<a name="fnB266" href="dan_note.htm#fn266"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> and ruling authority was given to it. <p>

<bqverse 7>7  After these things, as I was watching in the night visions a fourth beast appeared--one dreadful, terrible, and very strong.<a name="fnB267" href="dan_note.htm#fn267"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> It had two large rows<a name="fnB268" href="dan_note.htm#fn268"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> of iron teeth. It devoured and crushed, and anything that was left it trampled with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that came before it, and it had ten horns. <p>

<bqverse 8>8  "As I was contemplating the horns, another horn--a small one--came up between them, and three of the former horns were torn out by the roots to make room for it.<a name="fnB269" href="dan_note.htm#fn269"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> This horn had eyes resembling human eyes and a mouth speaking arrogant things. <p>

<bqverse 9>9  "While I was watching,</p>
<br>thrones were set up,<br>
and the Ancient of Days<a name="fnB270" href="dan_note.htm#fn270"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> took his seat.<br>

the hair of his head was like lamb's<a name="fnB271" href="dan_note.htm#fn271"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> wool.<br>
His throne was ablaze with fire<br>
and its wheels all aflame.<br>

<bqverse 10>10  A river of fire was streaming forth<br>
and proceeding from his presence.<br>
Many thousands were ministering to him;<br>
Many tens of thousands stood ready to serve him.<br>
The court convened<br>
and the books were opened.</ul><p>
<bqverse 11>11  "Then I kept on watching because of the arrogant words of the horn that was speaking. I was watching<a name="fnB272" href="dan_note.htm#fn272"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> until the beast was killed and its body destroyed and given over to flaming fire. 
<bqverse 12>12  As for the rest of the beasts, their ruling authority had already been removed, though they were permitted to go on living<a name="fnB273" href="dan_note.htm#fn273"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> for a time and a season. 
<bqverse 13>13  I was watching in the night visions,</p>

<bqverse 15>15  "As for me, Daniel, my spirit was distressed,<a name="fnB278" href="dan_note.htm#fn278"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> and the visions of my mind were troubling me. 
<bqverse 16>16  I approached one of those standing nearby and asked him about the meaning of all this. So he spoke with me and enabled me to understand the interpretation of the vision:<a name="fnB279" href="dan_note.htm#fn279"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  `These large beasts, which are four in number, represent four kings who will arise from the earth. 
<bqverse 18>18  The holy ones<a name="fnB280" href="dan_note.htm#fn280"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will take possession of the kingdom forever and ever.'<p>

<bqverse 19>19  "Then I wanted to know the meaning of the fourth beast, which was different form all the others--very dreadful, with two rows of iron teeth and bronze claws, and which devoured, crushed, and trampled anything that was left with its feet--
<bqverse 20>20  and the meaning of the ten horns on its head, and that other horn which came up and before which three others fell. This was the horn that had eyes<a name="fnB281" href="dan_note.htm#fn281"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> and a mouth speaking arrogant things, whose appearance was more formidable than the others.<a name="fnB282" href="dan_note.htm#fn282"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  While I was watching, that horn began to wage war against the holy ones and was defeating them, 
<bqverse 22>22  until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was rendered<a name="fnB283" href="dan_note.htm#fn283"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> in favor of the holy ones of the Most High. Then the time arrived for the holy ones to take possession of the kingdom.</p>
<br>
<bqverse 23>23  "This is what he told me: <br>
`The fourth beast means that there will be a fourth kingdom on earth<br>
that will differ from all the other kingdoms.<br>
It will devour all the earth<br>
and will trample and crush it.<br>

<bqverse 24>24  The ten horns<br>
mean that ten kings will arise from that kingdom.<br>
Another king will arise after them,<br>
but he will be different from the earlier ones.<br>
He will humiliate<a name="fnB284" href="dan_note.htm#fn284"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> three kings.<br>

<bqverse 25>25  He will speak words against the Most High.<br>
He will continually harass<a name="fnB285" href="dan_note.htm#fn285"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> the holy ones of the Most High.<br>
His intention will be to change times established by law.<a name="fnB286" href="dan_note.htm#fn286"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a><br>
They will be delivered into his hand<br>
For a time, times,<a name="fnB287" href="dan_note.htm#fn287"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> and half a time.<br>

<bqverse 26>26  But the court will convene, and his ruling authority will be removed--<br>
destroyed and abolished forever.<br>

<bqverse 27>27  Then the kingdom, authority,<br>
and greatness of the kingdoms under all of heaven<br>
will be delivered to the people of the holy ones of the Most High.<br>
His kingdom is an eternal kingdom; <br>
all authorities will serve him and obey him.'</ul><p>
<bqverse 28>28  "This is the conclusion of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts troubled me greatly, and the color drained from my face.<a name="fnB288" href="dan_note.htm#fn288"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> But I kept the matter to myself."

<p><i>Daniel Has a Vision of a Goat and a Ram</i>
<p><A NAME="8"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b><a name="fnB289" href="dan_note.htm#fn289"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> In the third year<a name="fnB290" href="dan_note.htm#fn290"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> of King Belshazzar's reign, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after the one that had appeared to me previously.<a name="fnB291" href="dan_note.htm#fn291"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  In this vision I saw myself in Susa<a name="fnB292" href="dan_note.htm#fn292"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> the citadel,<a name="fnB293" href="dan_note.htm#fn293"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> which is located in the province of Elam. In the vision I saw myself at the Ulai Canal.<a name="fnB294" href="dan_note.htm#fn294"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  I looked up and saw that a<a name="fnB295" href="dan_note.htm#fn295"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> ram with two horns was standing at the canal. Its two horns were both long,<a name="fnB296" href="dan_note.htm#fn296"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> but one was longer than the other. The longer one was coming up after the shorter one. 
<bqverse 4>4  I saw that the ram was butting westward, northward, and southward. No animal<a name="fnB297" href="dan_note.htm#fn297"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> was able to stand before it, and there was none who could deliver from its power. It acted as it wished and assumed great airs.<a name="fnB298" href="dan_note.htm#fn298"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 5>5  While I was contemplating all this, a male goat<a name="fnB299" href="dan_note.htm#fn299"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> was coming from the west over the surface of all the land<a name="fnB300" href="dan_note.htm#fn300"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> without touching the ground. This goat had a conspicuous horn<a name="fnB301" href="dan_note.htm#fn301"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> between its eyes. 
<bqverse 6>6  It came to the two-horned ram that I had seen standing beside the canal and rushed against it with raging strength. 
<bqverse 7>7  I saw it approaching the ram. It went into a fit of rage against the ram and struck it and broke off its two horns. The ram had no ability to resist it. The goat hurled the ram<a name="fnB302" href="dan_note.htm#fn302"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> to the ground and trampled it. No one could deliver the ram from its power.<a name="fnB303" href="dan_note.htm#fn303"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  The male goat assumed even greater airs. But no sooner had the large horn become strong than it was broken, and there arose four conspicuous horns<a name="fnB304" href="dan_note.htm#fn304"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> in its place,<a name="fnB305" href="dan_note.htm#fn305"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> extending toward the four winds of the sky.<a name="fnB306" href="dan_note.htm#fn306"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 9>9  From one of them came a small horn.<a name="fnB307" href="dan_note.htm#fn307"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> But it grew to be very big, toward the south and the east and the land of beauty.<a name="fnB308" href="dan_note.htm#fn308"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  It grew so big it reached the host of heaven, and it brought about the fall of some of the host and some of the stars to the ground, where it trampled them. 
<bqverse 11>11  It also assumed great airs even against the Prince of the host,<a name="fnB309" href="dan_note.htm#fn309"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> from whom<a name="fnB310" href="dan_note.htm#fn310"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> the daily sacrifice was removed and whose sanctuary<a name="fnB311" href="dan_note.htm#fn311"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> was thrown down. 
<bqverse 12>12  The host was given over,<a name="fnB312" href="dan_note.htm#fn312"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> along with the daily sacrifice, in the course of transgression.<a name="fnB313" href="dan_note.htm#fn313"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> It hurled<a name="fnB314" href="dan_note.htm#fn314"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> truth<a name="fnB315" href="dan_note.htm#fn315"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> to the ground and proceeded with success.<p>

<bqverse 13>13  Then I heard a holy one<a name="fnB316" href="dan_note.htm#fn316"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> speaking. Another holy one said to the one who was speaking, "To what period of time does the vision pertain, concerning the daily sacrifice and the desolating transgression and the giving over of both the sanctuary and host to be trampled?" 
<bqverse 14>14  He said to me, "To 2,300 evenings and mornings;<a name="fnB317" href="dan_note.htm#fn317"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> then the sanctuary will be vindicated." <a name="_Toc494012872"></a></p>
<p><i>An Angel Interprets Daniel's Vision</i>
<p>
<bqverse 15>15  While I, Daniel, was watching the vision, I sought to understand it. Now one who appeared to be a man was standing before me. 
<bqverse 16>16  Then I heard a human voice coming from between the banks of the Ulai. It called out, "Gabriel,<a name="fnB318" href="dan_note.htm#fn318"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> enable this person to understand the vision." 
<bqverse 17>17  So he approached where I was standing. As he came, I felt terrified and fell flat on the ground. Then he said to me, "Understand, son of man, that the vision pertains to the time of the end." 
<bqverse 18>18  As he spoke with me, I fell into a trance with my face to the ground. But he touched me and stood me upright.<p>

<bqverse 19>19  Then he said, "I am going to inform you about what will be in the latter time of wrath, for the vision<a name="fnB319" href="dan_note.htm#fn319"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> pertains to the appointed time of the end. 
<bqverse 20>20  The ram that you saw with the two horns stands for the kings of Media and Persia. 
<bqverse 21>21  The male goat<a name="fnB320" href="dan_note.htm#fn320"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> is the king of Greece, and the large horn between its eyes is the first king. 
<bqverse 22>22  The horn that was broken<a name="fnB321" href="dan_note.htm#fn321"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> and in whose place there arose four others stands for four kingdoms that will arise from his nation, though they will not have his strength. 
<bqverse 23>23  Toward the end of their rule, when transgressions<a name="fnB322" href="dan_note.htm#fn322"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> are complete, a rash and duplicitous king will arise. 
<bqverse 24>24  His power will be great, but it will not be by his strength alone. He will be destructive to an extraordinary degree. He will destroy powerful people and the people of the holy ones. 
<bqverse 25>25  By his skill he will make deceit successful through his influence. In his own mind he will assume great airs, and he will destroy many who are unaware of his schemes. He will rise up against the Prince of princes, but he will be broken apart from human agency. 
<bqverse 26>26  The vision of the evenings and mornings that was told to you is correct. But you should seal up the vision, for it refers to a time many days from now."<p>

<bqverse 27>27  I, Daniel, was exhausted<a name="fnB323" href="dan_note.htm#fn323"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> and sick for days. Then I got up and again carried out the king's business. But I was astonished at the vision, and there was no one to explain it.

<p><i>Daniel Prays for His People</i>
<p><A NAME="9"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> In the first<a name="fnB324" href="dan_note.htm#fn324"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> year of Darius son of Ahasuerus,<a name="fnB325" href="dan_note.htm#fn325"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> who was of Median descent and who had been<a name="fnB326" href="dan_note.htm#fn326"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> appointed king over the Babylonian<a name="fnB327" href="dan_note.htm#fn327"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> empire--
<bqverse 2>2  in the first year of his reign<a name="fnB328" href="dan_note.htm#fn328"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> I, Daniel, came to understand from the sacred books that, according to the word of the LORD<a name="fnB329" href="dan_note.htm#fn329"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> disclosed to the prophet Jeremiah, the years for the fulfilling of the reproach of Jerusalem were seventy in number. 
<bqverse 3>3  So I turned my attention to the Lord God<a name="fnB330" href="dan_note.htm#fn330"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> to implore him by prayer and supplications, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes. 
<bqverse 4>4  I prayed to the LORD my God, confessing in this way: <p>
"O Lord,<a name="fnB331" href="dan_note.htm#fn331"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> great and wondrous God who keeps covenant fidelity<a name="fnB332" href="dan_note.htm#fn332"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> with those who love him and keep his commandments, 
<bqverse 5>5  we have sinned, behaving with iniquity and wickedness, and we have rebelled by turning away from your commandments and judgments. 
<bqverse 6>6  We have not paid attention to your servants the prophets, who spoke as your representatives to our kings, our leaders, and our ancestors,<a name="fnB333" href="dan_note.htm#fn333"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and to all the inhabitants of the land as well. <p>

<bqverse 7>7  "Righteousness belongs to you, O Lord, but great shame belongs to us this day--to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, both near and far away in all the countries in which you have scattered them, because they have behaved unfaithfully toward you. 
<bqverse 8>8  O LORD, great shame belongs to us, our kings, our leaders, and our ancestors, because we have sinned against you. 
<bqverse 9>9  Yet to the Lord our God is compassionate and forgiving,<a name="fnB334" href="dan_note.htm#fn334"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> even though we have sinned against him. 
<bqverse 10>10  We have not paid attention to the voice of the LORD our God by living in the light of his laws<a name="fnB335" href="dan_note.htm#fn335"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> he set before us through his servants the prophets. <p>

<bqverse 11>11  "All Israel has transgressed your law and turned away by not paying attention to your voice. Therefore you have poured out on us this curse and the oath written in the law of Moses the servant of God, for we have sinned against you.<a name="fnB336" href="dan_note.htm#fn336"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  He has fulfilled his words which he spoke against us and our rulers<a name="fnB337" href="dan_note.htm#fn337"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> who were over us by bringing tremendous calamity on us--what was done with Jerusalem has never been equaled under all heaven! 
<bqverse 13>13  Just as it is written in the law of Moses, so all this calamity has come on us. Still we have not tried to appease the LORD our God by turning away from our iniquity and by gaining insight from his truth. 
<bqverse 14>14  The LORD was mindful of the calamity, and he brought it on us. For the LORD our God is righteous in all his deeds that he has done, and we have not paid attention to his voice.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  "Now, O Lord our God, who brought your people out of the land of Egypt with great power<a name="fnB338" href="dan_note.htm#fn338"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> and made a name for yourself that is remembered to this day--we have sinned and behaved wickedly. 
<bqverse 16>16  O Lord, according to all your righteousness, please turn your anger and wrath away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain. For due to our sins and the iniquities of our ancestors, Jerusalem and your people are mocked by all our neighbors. <p>

<bqverse 17>17  "So hear favorably now, our God, the prayer and supplications of your servant, and let your face shine on your devastated sanctuary for your own sake.<a name="fnB339" href="dan_note.htm#fn339"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  Listen attentively,<a name="fnB340" href="dan_note.htm#fn340"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> my God, and hear! Open your eyes and look on our desolations and the city which is identified with you.<a name="fnB341" href="dan_note.htm#fn341"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> For it is not because of our own righteous deeds that we are praying,<a name="fnB342" href="dan_note.htm#fn342"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> but because your compassion is abundant. 
<bqverse 19>19  O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, pay attention, and act! Don't delay, for your own sake, O my God! For you are identified with your city and with your people."<a name="_Toc494012874"></a></p>
<p><i>Gabriel Gives to Daniel a Prophecy of Seventy Weeks</i>
<p>
<bqverse 20>20  While I was still speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and presenting my request before the LORD my God concerning his holy mountain<a name="fnB343" href="dan_note.htm#fn343"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a>--

<bqverse 22>22  He spoke with me, instructing me as follows: "Daniel, I have now come to impart understanding to you. 
<bqverse 23>23  At the beginning of your requests a message went out, and I have come to convey it to you, for you are a precious treasure. Therefore consider the message and understand the vision:<a name="fnB346" href="dan_note.htm#fn346"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> </p>

until the end of the war that has been decreed;<br>

<bqverse 5>5  I looked up<a name="fnB370" href="dan_note.htm#fn370"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and saw a<a name="fnB371" href="dan_note.htm#fn371"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> man<a name="fnB372" href="dan_note.htm#fn372"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> clothed in linen;<a name="fnB373" href="dan_note.htm#fn373"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> around his waist was a belt made of gold from Upaz.<a name="fnB374" href="dan_note.htm#fn374"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  His body resembled yellow jasper,<a name="fnB375" href="dan_note.htm#fn375"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> and his face was like lightning. His eyes were like blazing torches; his arms and feet had the gleam of polished bronze. His voice<a name="fnB376" href="dan_note.htm#fn376"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> thundered forth like the sound of a large crowd.<p>

<bqverse 7>7  Only I, Daniel, saw the vision; the men who were with me did not see it.<a name="fnB377" href="dan_note.htm#fn377"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> On the contrary, they were overcome with fright and ran away to hide. 
<bqverse 8>8  I alone was left to see this great vision. My strength drained from me, and my vigor dissipated; I was without energy. 
<bqverse 9>9  I listened to his voice,<a name="fnB378" href="dan_note.htm#fn378"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and as I did so<a name="fnB379" href="dan_note.htm#fn379"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> I fell into a trance-like sleep with my face to the ground. 
<bqverse 10>10  Then a hand touched me and set me on my hands and knees.<a name="fnB380" href="dan_note.htm#fn380"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  He said to me, "Daniel, you are a treasured person. Understand the words that I am about to<a name="fnB381" href="dan_note.htm#fn381"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> speak to you. So stand up,<a name="fnB382" href="dan_note.htm#fn382"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> for I have now been sent to you." When he said this<a name="fnB383" href="dan_note.htm#fn383"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> to me, I stood up shaking. 
<bqverse 12>12  Then he said to me, "Don't be afraid, Daniel, for from the very first day you applied your mind<a name="fnB384" href="dan_note.htm#fn384"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> to understand and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard. I have come in response to your words. 
<bqverse 13>13  However, the prince of the kingdom of Persia was opposing me for twenty-one days. But Michael, one of the leading princes, came to help me, because I was left there<a name="fnB385" href="dan_note.htm#fn385"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> with the kings of Persia. 
<bqverse 14>14  Now I have come to enable you to understand what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision pertains to future days."<p>

<bqverse 15>15  While he was saying this to me,<a name="fnB386" href="dan_note.htm#fn386"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> I was flat on the ground and unable to speak. 
<bqverse 16>16  Then one who appeared to be a human being<a name="fnB387" href="dan_note.htm#fn387"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> was touching my lips. I opened my mouth and started to speak, saying to the one who was standing before me, "Sir,<a name="fnB388" href="dan_note.htm#fn388"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> due to the vision, anxiety has gripped me and I am utterly without strength. 
<bqverse 17>17  How, sir, am I able to speak with you?<a name="fnB389" href="dan_note.htm#fn389"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> My strength is gone, and I am breathless." 
<bqverse 18>18  Then the one who appeared to be a human being touched me again<a name="fnB390" href="dan_note.htm#fn390"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and energized me. 
<bqverse 19>19  He said to me, "Don't be afraid, treasured person. Peace be to you! Be strong! Be really strong!" When he spoke to me, I was strengthened. I said, "Sir, you may speak now, for you have given me strength." 
<bqverse 20>20  He said, "Do you know why I have come to you?<a name="fnB391" href="dan_note.htm#fn391"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> Now I am about to return to engage in battle with the prince of Persia. When I go, the prince of Greece is coming. 
<bqverse 21>21  However, I will first tell you what is written in a dependable book.<a name="fnB392" href="dan_note.htm#fn392"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> (There is no one who strengthens me against these princes,<a name="fnB393" href="dan_note.htm#fn393"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> except Michael your prince.

<p>"Three<a name="fnB395" href="dan_note.htm#fn395"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> more kings will arise for Persia. Then a fourth<a name="fnB396" href="dan_note.htm#fn396"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> king will be unusually rich, more so than all who preceded him. When he has amassed power through his riches, he will stir up everyone against<a name="fnB397" href="dan_note.htm#fn397"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> the kingdom of Greece. 
<bqverse 3>3  Then a powerful king<a name="fnB398" href="dan_note.htm#fn398"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> will arise, exercising great authority and doing as he pleases. 
<bqverse 4>4  Shortly after his rise to power, his kingdom will be broken up and distributed toward the four winds of the sky<a name="fnB399" href="dan_note.htm#fn399"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a>--but not to his posterity or with the authority he exercised, for his kingdom will be uprooted and distributed to others besides these.<p>

<bqverse 5>5  "Then the king of the south<a name="fnB400" href="dan_note.htm#fn400"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> and one of his subordinates<a name="fnB401" href="dan_note.htm#fn401"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> will grow strong. His subordinate<a name="fnB402" href="dan_note.htm#fn402"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> will grow strong against him and will rule a kingdom greater than his. 
<bqverse 6>6  After some years have passed, they<a name="fnB403" href="dan_note.htm#fn403"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> will form an alliance. Then the daughter<a name="fnB404" href="dan_note.htm#fn404"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make an agreement, but she will not retain her power,<a name="fnB405" href="dan_note.htm#fn405"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> nor will he continue in his strength.<a name="fnB406" href="dan_note.htm#fn406"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> She, together with the one who brought her, her child,<a name="fnB407" href="dan_note.htm#fn407"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> and her benefactor, will all be delivered over at that time.<a name="fnB408" href="dan_note.htm#fn408"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 7>7  "There will arise in her place one from her family line<a name="fnB409" href="dan_note.htm#fn409"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> who will come against their army and will enter the stronghold of the king of the north and will move against them successfully. 
<bqverse 8>8  He will also take their gods into captivity to Egypt, along with their cast images and prized utensils of silver and gold. Then he will withdraw for some years from<a name="fnB410" href="dan_note.htm#fn410"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> the king of the north. 
<bqverse 9>9  Then the king of the north<a name="fnB411" href="dan_note.htm#fn411"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> will advance against the empire of the king of the south, but will withdraw to his own land. 
<bqverse 10>10  His sons<a name="fnB412" href="dan_note.htm#fn412"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> will wage war, mustering a large army which will advance like an overflowing river and carrying the battle all the way to the enemy's<a name="fnB413" href="dan_note.htm#fn413"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> fortress.<p>

<bqverse 11>11  "Then the king of the south<a name="fnB414" href="dan_note.htm#fn414"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> will be enraged and will march out to fight against the king of the north, who will also muster a large army, but that army will be delivered into his hand. 
<bqverse 12>12  When the army is taken away, the king of the south will become arrogant.<a name="fnB415" href="dan_note.htm#fn415"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> He will be responsible for the death of thousands and thousands of people,<a name="fnB416" href="dan_note.htm#fn416"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> but he will not continue to prevail. 
<bqverse 13>13  For the king of the north will again muster an army, one larger than before. At the end of some years he will advance with a huge army and enormous supplies. <p>

<bqverse 14>14  "In those times many will oppose the king of the south.<a name="fnB417" href="dan_note.htm#fn417"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> Those characterized by violence among your own people will rise up in confirmation of the vision, but they will falter. 
<bqverse 15>15  Then the king of the north will advance and will build siege mounds and capture a well-fortified city.<a name="fnB418" href="dan_note.htm#fn418"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> The forces of the south will not prevail, not even his finest contingents. They will have no strength to prevail. 
<bqverse 16>16  The one advancing against him will do as he pleases, and no one will be able to stand before him. He will prevail in the land of beauty, and its annihilation will be within his power. 
<bqverse 17>17  His intention will be to come with the strength of his entire kingdom, but he will bring with him alliances which he will enact.<a name="fnB419" href="dan_note.htm#fn419"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> And he will give the king of the south<a name="fnB420" href="dan_note.htm#fn420"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> a daughter<a name="fnB421" href="dan_note.htm#fn421"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> in marriage in order to destroy the kingdom, but it will not turn out to his advantage. 
<bqverse 18>18  Then he will turn his attention to the coastal regions and will capture many of them. But a commander<a name="fnB422" href="dan_note.htm#fn422"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> will bring his shameful conduct to a halt; in addition,<a name="fnB423" href="dan_note.htm#fn423"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> he will turn his shameful conduct back on him. 
<bqverse 19>19  He will then turn his attention to the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble and fall, not to be found again. 
<bqverse 20>20  There will arise after him one<a name="fnB424" href="dan_note.htm#fn424"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> who will send out an exactor<a name="fnB425" href="dan_note.htm#fn425"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> of tribute to enhance the splendor of the kingdom, but after a few years he will be destroyed,<a name="fnB426" href="dan_note.htm#fn426"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> though not in anger or battle.<p>

<bqverse 21>21  "Then there will arise in his place a despicable person<a name="fnB427" href="dan_note.htm#fn427"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> to whom the royal honor has not been rightfully conferred. He will come on the scene in a time of prosperity and will seize the kingdom through duplicity. 
<bqverse 22>22  Armies will be suddenly<a name="fnB428" href="dan_note.htm#fn428"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> swept away in defeat before him; both they and a covenant leader<a name="fnB429" href="dan_note.htm#fn429"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> will be destroyed.<a name="fnB430" href="dan_note.htm#fn430"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23  After<a name="fnB431" href="dan_note.htm#fn431"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> entering into an alliance with him, he will behave treacherously; he will ascend to power with only a small force. 
<bqverse 24>24  In a time of prosperity for the most productive areas of the province he will enter and accomplish what neither his fathers nor their fathers were able to do.<a name="fnB432" href="dan_note.htm#fn432"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> He will distribute loot, spoils, and property to his followers, and he will devise plans against fortified cities, but not for long. 
<bqverse 25>25  He will rouse his strength and enthusiasm against the king of the south<a name="fnB433" href="dan_note.htm#fn433"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> with a large army. The king of the south will wage war with a large and very powerful army, but he will not be able to prevail because of the plans devised against him. 
<bqverse 26>26  Those who share in the king's fine food will attempt to destroy him, and his army will be swept away;<a name="fnB434" href="dan_note.htm#fn434"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> many will be killed in battle. 
<bqverse 27>27  These two kings, their minds filled with evil intentions, will trade lies with one another at the same table. But it will not succeed, for there is still an end at the appointed time. Then he will return to his land with a great deal of property, yet with his mind opposing a holy covenant. He will initiate action and then return to his land. 
<bqverse 28>28  Then the king of the north<a name="fnB435" href="dan_note.htm#fn435"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> will return to his own land with much property. His mind will be set against the holy covenant. He will take action, and then return to his own land. 
<bqverse 29>29  At an appointed time he will again enter the south, but this latter visit will not turn out the way the former one did. 
<bqverse 30>30  The ships of Kittim<a name="fnB436" href="dan_note.htm#fn436"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> will go against him, leaving him disheartened.<a name="fnB437" href="dan_note.htm#fn437"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> He will turn back and direct his indignation against the holy covenant. He will return and honor<a name="fnB438" href="dan_note.htm#fn438"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> those who forsake the holy covenant. 
<bqverse 31>31  His forces<a name="fnB439" href="dan_note.htm#fn439"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> will rise up and profane the fortified sanctuary,<a name="fnB440" href="dan_note.htm#fn440"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> stopping the daily sacrifice. In its place they will set up<a name="fnB441" href="dan_note.htm#fn441"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> the abomination that makes for desolation. 
<bqverse 32>32  Then he will defile<a name="fnB442" href="dan_note.htm#fn442"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> those who have acted wickedly toward the covenant. But the people who know their God will act valiantly.<a name="fnB443" href="dan_note.htm#fn443"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 33>33  These who are wise among the people will teach the masses.<a name="fnB444" href="dan_note.htm#fn444"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> However, they will fall<a name="fnB445" href="dan_note.htm#fn445"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> by the sword, and by burning, and be imprisoned and plundered for some time.<a name="fnB446" href="dan_note.htm#fn446"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 34>34  When they stumble, they will be granted some help. But many will unite with them duplicitously. 
<bqverse 35>35  Even some of the wise will stumble, resulting in their refinement, purification, and cleansing until the time of the end, for it is still for the appointed time.<p>

<bqverse 36>36  "Then the king<a name="fnB447" href="dan_note.htm#fn447"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> will do as he pleases.

<bqverse 37>37  He will not even consider the gods of his fathers--not even the god<a name="fnB449" href="dan_note.htm#fn449"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> regarded by women. He will not consider any god; he will elevate himself above them all. 
<bqverse 38>38  What he will honor is a god of fortresses--a god his fathers did not acknowledge he will honor with gold, silver, valuable stones, and treasured commodities. 
<bqverse 39>39  He will take action against mighty fortresses, aided by a foreign deity. Those who recognize him he will grant considerable honor. He will place them in authority over many people, and he will parcel out land for a price.<a name="fnB450" href="dan_note.htm#fn450"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 40>40  "At the time of the end the king of the south will attack<a name="fnB451" href="dan_note.htm#fn451"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a> him.

<bqverse 41>41  Then he will enter the land of beauty. Many<a name="fnB453" href="dan_note.htm#fn453"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a> will fall, but these will escape: Edom, Moab, and the Ammonite leadership. 
<bqverse 42>42  He will extend his power against other lands; the land of Egypt will not escape. 
<bqverse 43>43  He will have sovereign control over the hidden stores of gold, silver, and all the treasures of Egypt. Libyans and Ethiopians<a name="fnB454" href="dan_note.htm#fn454"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>69</SUP></FONT></a> will also follow in submission after him.<a name="fnB455" href="dan_note.htm#fn455"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>70</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 44>44  But reports will trouble him from the east and north, and he will set out in a tremendous rage to destroy and wipe out many. 
<bqverse 45>45  He will pitch his royal tents between the seas<a name="fnB456" href="dan_note.htm#fn456"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>71</SUP></FONT></a> toward the beautiful holy mountain. But he will come to his end, with no one to assist him.</p>
