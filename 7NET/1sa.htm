<a name="_Toc494011871"></a><p><i>Hannah Gives Birth to Samuel</i>
<p><A NAME="1"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> There was a man from Ramathaim Zuphim,<a name="fnB0" href="1sa_note.htm#fn0"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah. He was the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. 
<bqverse 2>2 He had two wives; the name of the first was Hannah and the name of the second was Peninnah. Now Peninnah had children, but Hannah was childless. <p>

<bqverse 3>3  Year after year<a name="fnB1" href="1sa_note.htm#fn1"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> this man would go up from his city to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts at Shiloh. It was there that the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phineas, served as the LORD's priests. 
<bqverse 4>4  Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he used to give meat portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters. 
<bqverse 5>5  But he would give a double<a name="fnB2" href="1sa_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> portion to Hannah, because he especially loved her.<a name="fnB3" href="1sa_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> Now the LORD had not enabled her to have children.<a name="fnB4" href="1sa_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  Her rival wife used to upset her and make her worry,<a name="fnB5" href="1sa_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> for the LORD had not enabled her to have children. 
<bqverse 7>7  Peninnah<a name="fnB6" href="1sa_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> would behave this way year after year. Whenever Hannah<a name="fnB7" href="1sa_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> went up to the LORD's house, Peninnah<a name="fnB8" href="1sa_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> would upset her so that she would weep and not eat. 
<bqverse 8>8  Finally Elkanah her husband said to her, "Hannah, Why do you weep and not eat? Why are you so sad?<a name="fnB9" href="1sa_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> Am I not better to you than ten<a name="fnB10" href="1sa_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> sons?" <p>

<bqverse 9>9  On one occasion in Shiloh, after they had finished eating and drinking, Hannah got up.<a name="fnB11" href="1sa_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> (Now at the time Eli the priest was sitting in his chair<a name="fnB12" href="1sa_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> by the doorpost of the LORD's temple.) 
<bqverse 10>10  She was very upset<a name="fnB13" href="1sa_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> as she prayed to the LORD, and she was weeping uncontrollably.<a name="fnB14" href="1sa_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  She made a vow saying, "O LORD of hosts, if you will look with compassion<a name="fnB15" href="1sa_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> on the suffering of your female servant,<a name="fnB16" href="1sa_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> remembering me and not forgetting your servant, and give a male child<a name="fnB17" href="1sa_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> to your servant, then I will dedicate him to the LORD all the days of his life. His hair will never be cut."<a name="fnB18" href="1sa_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 12>12  As she continued praying to<a name="fnB19" href="1sa_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD, Eli was watching her mouth. 
<bqverse 13>13  Now Hannah was speaking from her heart. Although her lips were moving, her voice was inaudible. Eli therefore thought she was drunk. 
<bqverse 14>14  So he<a name="fnB20" href="1sa_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> said to her, "How often do you intend to get drunk? Put away your wine!" <p>

<bqverse 15>15  But Hannah replied, "That's not the way it is,<a name="fnB21" href="1sa_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> my lord! I am under a great deal of stress.<a name="fnB22" href="1sa_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> I have drunk neither wine nor beer. Rather, I have poured out my soul to<a name="fnB23" href="1sa_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD. 
<bqverse 16>16  Don't consider your servant a wicked woman,<a name="fnB24" href="1sa_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> for until now I have spoken from my deep pain and anguish." <p>

<bqverse 17>17  Eli replied, "Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant the request that you have asked of him." 
<bqverse 18>18  She said, "May I, your servant, find favor in your sight." So the woman went her way and got something to eat.<a name="fnB25" href="1sa_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> Her face no longer looked sad.<p>

<bqverse 19>19  They got up early the next morning and after worshiping the LORD, they returned to their home at Ramah. Elkanah had marital relations with<a name="fnB26" href="1sa_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> his wife Hannah, and the LORD remembered<a name="fnB27" href="1sa_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> her. 
<bqverse 20>20  After some time Hannah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, thinking, "I asked the LORD for him.<a name="fnB28" href="1sa_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494011872"></a></p>
<p><i>Hannah Dedicates Samuel to the LORD</i>
<p>
<bqverse 21>21  This man Elkanah went up with all his family to make the yearly sacrifice to the LORD and to keep his vow, 
<bqverse 22>22  but Hannah did not go up.<a name="fnB29" href="1sa_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> Instead she said to her husband, "Once the boy is weaned, I will bring him and appear before the LORD, and he will remain there from then on." <p>

<bqverse 23>23  So her husband Elkanah said to her, "Do what you think best.<a name="fnB30" href="1sa_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> Stay until you have weaned him. May the LORD fulfill his promise."<a name="fnB31" href="1sa_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a><p>
So the woman stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him. 
<bqverse 24>24  Once she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with three bulls, an ephah<a name="fnB32" href="1sa_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> of flour, and a container of wine. She brought him to the LORD's house at Shiloh, even though he was young.<a name="fnB33" href="1sa_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  Once the bull had been slaughtered, they brought the boy to Eli. 
<bqverse 26>26  She said, "Just as surely as you are alive, my lord, I am the woman who previously stood here with you in order to pray to the LORD. 
<bqverse 27>27  I prayed for this boy, and the LORD has given me the request that I asked of him. 
<bqverse 28>28  Now I dedicate him to the LORD. From this time on he is dedicated to the LORD." Then they<a name="fnB34" href="1sa_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> worshiped the LORD there.

<p><i>Hannah Exalts the LORD in Prayer</i>
<p><A NAME="2"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>Hannah prayed,</p>
<br>"My heart rejoices in the LORD;<br>
my horn<a name="fnB35" href="1sa_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> is exalted high because of the LORD.<br>
I loudly denounce<a name="fnB36" href="1sa_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> my enemies,<br>
for I am happy that you delivered me.<a name="fnB37" href="1sa_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 2>2 No one is holy<a name="fnB38" href="1sa_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> like the LORD!<br>
There is no one other than you!<br>
There is no rock<a name="fnB39" href="1sa_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> like our God!<br>

<bqverse 3>3 Don't keep speaking so arrogantly,<a name="fnB40" href="1sa_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a><br>
letting proud talk come out of your mouth.<br>
For the LORD is a God who knows;<br>
he<a name="fnB41" href="1sa_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> evaluates what people do.<br>

<bqverse 4>4 The bows of warriors are shattered,<br>
but those who stumble find their strength reinforced.<br>

<bqverse 5>5 Those who are well-fed hire themselves out to earn food,<br>
but the hungry no longer lack.<br>
Even<a name="fnB42" href="1sa_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> the barren woman gives birth to seven,<a name="fnB43" href="1sa_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a><br>
but the one with lots of children withers away.<a name="fnB44" href="1sa_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 6>6 The LORD both kills and gives life;<br>
he brings down to the grave and raises up.<br>

<bqverse 7>7 The LORD impoverishes and makes wealthy;<br>
he humbles and exalts.<br>

<bqverse 8>8 He lifts the weak from the dust;<br>
he raises<a name="fnB45" href="1sa_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> the poor from the ash heap<br>
to seat them with princes<br>
and to bestow on them an honored position.<a name="fnB46" href="1sa_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a><br>
The foundations of the earth belong to the LORD,<br>
and he has placed the world on them.<br>

<bqverse 9>9 He watches over<a name="fnB47" href="1sa_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> his holy ones,<a name="fnB48" href="1sa_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a><br>
but the wicked are made speechless in the darkness,<br>
for it is not by one's own strength that one prevails.<br>

<bqverse 10>10 The LORD shatters<a name="fnB49" href="1sa_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> his adversaries;<a name="fnB50" href="1sa_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a><br>
he thunders against them from<a name="fnB51" href="1sa_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> the heavens.<br>
The LORD executes judgment to the ends of the earth.<br>
He will strengthen<a name="fnB52" href="1sa_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> his king<br>
and exalt the power<a name="fnB53" href="1sa_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> of his anointed one."<a name="fnB54" href="1sa_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a></ul><p>
<bqverse 11>11 Then Elkanah went back home to Ramah. But the boy was serving the LORD under the supervision of<a name="fnB55" href="1sa_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> Eli the priest.<a name="_Toc494011874"></a></p>
<p><i>Eli</i>'<i>s Sons Misuse Their Sacred Office</i>
<p>
<bqverse 12>12  The sons of Eli were wicked men.<a name="fnB56" href="1sa_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> They did not recognize the LORD's authority.<a name="fnB57" href="1sa_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  Now the priests would always treat the people in the following way:<a name="fnB58" href="1sa_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> Whenever anyone was making a sacrifice, while the meat was boiling, the priest's attendant would come with a three-pronged fork<a name="fnB59" href="1sa_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> in his hand. 
<bqverse 14>14  He would jab it into the basin, kettle, caldron, or pot, and everything that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they used to do to all the Israelites<a name="fnB60" href="1sa_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> when they came there to Shiloh.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  Even before they burned the fat, the priest's attendant would come and say to the person who was making the sacrifice, "Hand over some meat for the priest to roast. He won't take boiled meat from you, but only uncooked."<a name="fnB61" href="1sa_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  If the individual said to him, "First let the fat be burned away, and then take for yourself whatever you wish," he would say, "No!<a name="fnB62" href="1sa_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> Hand it over right now! If you don't, I will take it forcibly!" <p>

<bqverse 17>17  The sin of these young men was very great in the LORD's sight, for they<a name="fnB63" href="1sa_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> treated the LORD's offering with contempt. <p>

<bqverse 18>18  Now Samuel was ministering before the LORD. The boy was dressed in a linen ephod. 
<bqverse 19>19  His mother used to make him a small robe and bring it up to him at regular intervals when she would go up with her husband to make the annual sacrifice. 
<bqverse 20>20  Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife saying, "May the LORD raise up for you descendants<a name="fnB64" href="1sa_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> from this woman to replace the one that she<a name="fnB65" href="1sa_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> dedicated to the LORD." Then they would go to their<a name="fnB66" href="1sa_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> home. 
<bqverse 21>21  So the LORD graciously attended to Hannah, and she was able to conceive and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. The boy Samuel grew up at the LORD's sanctuary.<a name="fnB67" href="1sa_note.htm#fn67"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 22>22 Now Eli was very old when he heard about everything that his sons used to do to all the people of Israel<a name="fnB68" href="1sa_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> and how they used to have sex with<a name="fnB69" href="1sa_note.htm#fn69"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> the women who were stationed at the entrance to the tent of meeting. 
<bqverse 23>23  He said to them, "Why do you behave in this way? For I hear about these evil things from all these<a name="fnB70" href="1sa_note.htm#fn70"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> people. 
<bqverse 24>24  This ought not to be,<a name="fnB71" href="1sa_note.htm#fn71"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> my sons! For the report that I hear circulating among the LORD's people is not good. 
<bqverse 25>25  If a man sins against a man, one may appeal to God on his behalf. But if a man sins against the LORD, who will then pray for him?" But they would not listen to their father, for the LORD had decided<a name="fnB72" href="1sa_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> to kill them.<p>

<bqverse 26>26  Now the boy Samuel was growing up and finding favor both with the LORD and with men. <a name="_Toc494011875"></a></p>
<p><i>The LORD Judges the House of Eli</i>
<p>
<bqverse 27>27  A man of God came to Eli and said to him, "This is what the LORD says: `Did I not plainly<a name="fnB73" href="1sa_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> reveal myself to your ancestor's<a name="fnB74" href="1sa_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> house when they were in Egypt in the house of Pharaoh? 
<bqverse 28>28  I chose your ancestor<a name="fnB75" href="1sa_note.htm#fn75"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> from all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer sacrifice on my altar, to burn incense, and to bear the ephod before me. I gave to your ancestor's house all the fire offerings made by the Israelites. 
<bqverse 29>29  Why are you<a name="fnB76" href="1sa_note.htm#fn76"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> scorning my sacrifice and my offering that I commanded for my dwelling place?<a name="fnB77" href="1sa_note.htm#fn77"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> You have honored your sons more than you have me in that you have made yourselves fat from the best parts of all the offerings of my people Israel.'<p>

<bqverse 30>30  Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, says, `I really did say<a name="fnB78" href="1sa_note.htm#fn78"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> that your house and your ancestor's house would serve<a name="fnB79" href="1sa_note.htm#fn79"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> me forever.' But now the LORD says, `May it never be!<a name="fnB80" href="1sa_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> For I will honor those who honor me, but those who despise me will be cursed! 
<bqverse 31>31  In fact, days are coming when I will remove your strength<a name="fnB81" href="1sa_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> and the strength<a name="fnB82" href="1sa_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> of your father's house. There will not be an old man in your house!
<bqverse 32>32  You will see trouble in my dwelling place.<a name="fnB83" href="1sa_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> Israel will experience blessings,<a name="fnB84" href="1sa_note.htm#fn84"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> but there will not be an old man in your<a name="fnB85" href="1sa_note.htm#fn85"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> house for all time.<a name="fnB86" href="1sa_note.htm#fn86"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 33>33  The man that I do not cut off from my altar, I will cause your<a name="fnB87" href="1sa_note.htm#fn87"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> eyes to fail<a name="fnB88" href="1sa_note.htm#fn88"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> and will cause you grief.<a name="fnB89" href="1sa_note.htm#fn89"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> All of those born to your family<a name="fnB90" href="1sa_note.htm#fn90"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> will die in the prime of life.<a name="fnB91" href="1sa_note.htm#fn91"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 34>34  This will be a confirming sign for you that will be fulfilled through your two sons,<a name="fnB92" href="1sa_note.htm#fn92"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> Hophni and Phinehas: in a single day they both will die! 
<bqverse 35>35  Then I will raise up for myself a faithful priest. He will do what is in my heart and soul. I will build for him a secure dynasty<a name="fnB93" href="1sa_note.htm#fn93"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> and he will serve my chosen one for all time.<a name="fnB94" href="1sa_note.htm#fn94"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 36>36  Everyone who remains in your house will come to bow before him for a payment of money and for a piece of bread. Each will say, `Assign me to a priestly task so I can eat a piece of bread.'"

<p><i>The Call of Samuel</i>
<p><A NAME="3"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Now the boy Samuel continued serving the LORD under Eli's supervision.<a name="fnB95" href="1sa_note.htm#fn95"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> Word from the LORD was rare in those days; revelatory visions were infrequent.<p>

<bqverse 2>2  Eli's eyes had begun to fail, so that he was unable to see well. At that time he was lying down in his place, 
<bqverse 3>3  and the lamp of God had not yet been extinguished. Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD as well; the ark of God was also there. 
<bqverse 4>4  The LORD called to Samuel, and he replied, "Here I am!" 
<bqverse 5>5  Then he ran to Eli and said, "Here I am, for you called me." But Eli<a name="fnB96" href="1sa_note.htm#fn96"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> said, "I didn't call you. Go back and lie down." So he went back and lay down. 
<bqverse 6>6  The LORD again called, "Samuel!" So Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am, for you called me." But Eli<a name="fnB97" href="1sa_note.htm#fn97"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> said, "I didn't call you, my son. Go back and lie down."<p>

<bqverse 7>7  Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD; the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him. 
<bqverse 8>8  Then the LORD called Samuel a third time. So he got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am, for you called me!" Eli then realized that it was the LORD who was calling the boy. 
<bqverse 9>9  So Eli said to Samuel, "Go back and lie down. When he calls you, say, "Speak, LORD, for your servant is listening." So Samuel went back and lay down in his place.<p>

<bqverse 10>10  Then the LORD came and stood nearby, calling as he had previously done, "Samuel! Samuel!" Samuel replied, "Speak, for your servant is listening!" 
<bqverse 11>11  The LORD said to Samuel, "Look! I am about to do something in Israel;<a name="fnB98" href="1sa_note.htm#fn98"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> when anyone hears about it, both of his ears will tingle. 
<bqverse 12>12  On that day I will carry out<a name="fnB99" href="1sa_note.htm#fn99"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> against Eli everything that I spoke about his house--from start to finish! 
<bqverse 13>13  You<a name="fnB100" href="1sa_note.htm#fn100"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> should tell him that I am about to judge his house forever because of<a name="fnB101" href="1sa_note.htm#fn101"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> the sin that he knew about. For his sons were cursing God,<a name="fnB102" href="1sa_note.htm#fn102"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> and he did not rebuke them. 
<bqverse 14>14  Therefore I swore an oath to the house of Eli, `The sin of the house of Eli can never be forgiven by sacrifice or by grain offering.'"<p>

<bqverse 15>15  So Samuel lay down until morning. Then he opened the doors of the LORD's house. But Samuel was afraid to tell Eli about the vision. 
<bqverse 16>16  However, Eli called Samuel and said, "Samuel, my son!" He replied, "Here I am." 
<bqverse 17>17  Eli<a name="fnB103" href="1sa_note.htm#fn103"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> said, "What message did he speak to you? Don't conceal it from me. God will judge you severely<a name="fnB104" href="1sa_note.htm#fn104"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> if you conceal from me anything that he said to you!"<p>

<bqverse 18>18  So Samuel told him everything. He did not hold back anything from him. Eli<a name="fnB105" href="1sa_note.htm#fn105"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> said, "The LORD will do what he pleases."<a name="fnB106" href="1sa_note.htm#fn106"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  Samuel continued to grow, and the LORD was with him. None of his prophecies fell to the ground unfulfilled.<a name="fnB107" href="1sa_note.htm#fn107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  All Israel from Dan to Beersheba realized that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the LORD. 
<bqverse 21>21  Then the LORD again appeared in Shiloh, for it was in Shiloh that the LORD had revealed himself to Samuel<a name="fnB108" href="1sa_note.htm#fn108"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> through the word of the LORD.<a name="fnB109" href="1sa_note.htm#fn109"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqchapter 4><A NAME="4"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Samuel revealed the word of the LORD<a name="fnB110" href="1sa_note.htm#fn110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> to all Israel.<a name="_Toc494011877"></a></p>
<p><i>The Ark of the Covenant is Lost to the Philistines</i>
<p>Then the Israelites went out to fight the Philistines.<a name="fnB111" href="1sa_note.htm#fn111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> They camped at Ebenezer,<a name="fnB112" href="1sa_note.htm#fn112"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> and the Philistines camped at Aphek. 
<bqverse 2>2  The Philistines arranged their forces to fight<a name="fnB113" href="1sa_note.htm#fn113"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> Israel. As the battle spread out,<a name="fnB114" href="1sa_note.htm#fn114"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> Israel was defeated by<a name="fnB115" href="1sa_note.htm#fn115"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> the Philistines, who<a name="fnB116" href="1sa_note.htm#fn116"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> killed about four thousand men in the battle line in the field.<p>

<bqverse 3>3  When the army<a name="fnB117" href="1sa_note.htm#fn117"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> came back to the camp, the elders of Israel said, "Why did the LORD let us be defeated today by<a name="fnB118" href="1sa_note.htm#fn118"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> the Philistines? Let's take with us the ark of the covenant of the LORD from Shiloh. When it is with us, it will save us<a name="fnB119" href="1sa_note.htm#fn119"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> from the hand of our enemies.<p>

<bqverse 4>4  So the army<a name="fnB120" href="1sa_note.htm#fn120"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> sent to Shiloh, and they took from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts who sits between the cherubim. Now the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phineas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God. 
<bqverse 5>5  When the ark of the covenant of the LORD arrived at the camp, all Israel shouted so loudly<a name="fnB121" href="1sa_note.htm#fn121"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> that the ground shook. <p>

<bqverse 6>6  When the Philistines heard the sound of the shout, they said, "What is this loud shout in the camp of the Hebrews?" Then they realized that the ark of the LORD had arrived at the camp. 
<bqverse 7>7  The Philistines were scared because they thought that gods had come to the camp.<a name="fnB122" href="1sa_note.htm#fn122"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> They said, "Too bad for<a name="fnB123" href="1sa_note.htm#fn123"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> us! We've never seen anything like this! 
<bqverse 8>8  Too bad for us! Who can deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all sorts of plagues in the desert! 
<bqverse 9>9  Be strong and act like men, you Philistines, or else you will wind up serving the Hebrews the way they have served you! Act like men and fight!" <p>

<bqverse 10>10  So the Philistines fought. Israel was defeated; they all ran home.<a name="fnB124" href="1sa_note.htm#fn124"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> The slaughter was very great; thirty thousand foot soldiers fell in battle. 
<bqverse 11>11  The ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phineas, were killed. <a name="_Toc494011878"></a></p>
<p><i>Eli Dies</i>
<p>
<bqverse 12>12  On that day<a name="fnB125" href="1sa_note.htm#fn125"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> a Benjaminite ran from the battle lines and came to Shiloh. His clothes were torn and dirt was on his head. 
<bqverse 13>13  When he arrived in Shiloh, Eli was sitting in his chair watching by the side of<a name="fnB126" href="1sa_note.htm#fn126"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> the road, for he was very worried<a name="fnB127" href="1sa_note.htm#fn127"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> about the ark of God. As the man entered the city to give his report,<a name="fnB128" href="1sa_note.htm#fn128"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> the whole city cried out. <p>

<bqverse 14>14  When Eli heard the outcry,<a name="fnB129" href="1sa_note.htm#fn129"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> he said, "What is this commotion?"<a name="fnB130" href="1sa_note.htm#fn130"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> The man quickly came and told Eli. 
<bqverse 15>15  Now Eli was ninety-eight years old and his eyes looked straight ahead;<a name="fnB131" href="1sa_note.htm#fn131"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> he was unable to see. <p>

<bqverse 16>16  The man said to Eli, "I am the one who came from the battle lines! Just today I fled from the battle lines!" Eli<a name="fnB132" href="1sa_note.htm#fn132"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> asked, "How did things go, my son?" 
<bqverse 17>17  The messenger replied, "Israel has fled from<a name="fnB133" href="1sa_note.htm#fn133"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> the Philistines! The army has suffered a great defeat! Your two sons, Hophni and Phineas, are dead! The ark of God has been captured!" <p>

<bqverse 18>18  When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli<a name="fnB134" href="1sa_note.htm#fn134"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> fell backward from his chair beside the gate. He broke his neck and died, for he<a name="fnB135" href="1sa_note.htm#fn135"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> was old and heavy. He had judged Israel for forty years.<p>

<bqverse 19>19  His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phineas, was pregnant and close to giving birth. When she heard that the ark of God was captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she doubled over and gave birth. But her labor pains were too much for her. 
<bqverse 20>20  As she was dying, the women who were there with her said, "Don't fear! You have given birth to a son!" But she did not reply or pay attention.<a name="fnB136" href="1sa_note.htm#fn136"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 21>21  She named the boy Ichabod,<a name="fnB137" href="1sa_note.htm#fn137"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> saying, "The glory has departed from Israel," referring to the capture of the ark of God and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband. 
<bqverse 22>22  She said, "The glory has departed from Israel, because the ark of God has been captured."

<p><i>The Ark Causes Trouble for the Philistines</i>
<p><A NAME="5"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>Now the Philistines had captured the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. 
<bqverse 2>2  The Philistines took the ark of God and brought it to the temple of Dagon, where they positioned it beside Dagon. 
<bqverse 3>3  When the residents of Ashdod got up early the next day,<a name="fnB138" href="1sa_note.htm#fn138"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> Dagon was lying on the ground before the ark of the LORD. So they took Dagon and set him back in his place. 
<bqverse 4>4  But when they got up early the next day, Dagon was again lying on the ground before the ark of the LORD. The head of Dagon and his two hands were sheared off and were lying at the threshold. Only Dagon's body was left intact.<a name="fnB139" href="1sa_note.htm#fn139"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  For this reason to this very day neither Dagon's priests nor anyone else who enters Dagon's temple step on Dagon's threshold in Ashdod. <p>

<bqverse 6>6  The LORD severely attacked<a name="fnB140" href="1sa_note.htm#fn140"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> the residents of Ashdod, bringing devastation on them. He struck the people of<a name="fnB141" href="1sa_note.htm#fn141"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> both Ashdod and the surrounding area with sores.<a name="fnB142" href="1sa_note.htm#fn142"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  When the people<a name="fnB143" href="1sa_note.htm#fn143"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, "The ark of the God of Israel should not remain with us, for he has attacked<a name="fnB144" href="1sa_note.htm#fn144"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> both us and our god Dagon!" <p>

<bqverse 8>8  So they assembled<a name="fnB145" href="1sa_note.htm#fn145"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> all the leaders of the Philistines and said, "What should we do with the ark of the God of Israel?" They replied, "The ark of the God of Israel should be removed to Gath." So they removed the ark of the God of Israel. <p>

<bqverse 9>9  But after it had been removed, the LORD attacked<a name="fnB146" href="1sa_note.htm#fn146"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> that city as well, causing a great deal of panic. He struck all the people of that city with sores.<a name="fnB147" href="1sa_note.htm#fn147"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. <p>
But when the ark of God arrived at Ekron, the residents of Ekron cried out saying, "They have brought the ark of the God of Israel here<a name="fnB148" href="1sa_note.htm#fn148"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> to kill our<a name="fnB149" href="1sa_note.htm#fn149"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> people!" 
<bqverse 11>11  So they assembled<a name="fnB150" href="1sa_note.htm#fn150"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> all the leaders of the Philistines and said, "Get the ark of the God of Israel out of here!

The terror<a name="fnB153" href="1sa_note.htm#fn153"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> of death was throughout the entire city; God was attacking them very severely there.<a name="fnB154" href="1sa_note.htm#fn154"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  The people<a name="fnB155" href="1sa_note.htm#fn155"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> who did not die were struck with sores; the city's cry for help went all the way up to heaven.

<p><i>The Philistines Return the Ark</i>
<p><A NAME="6"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> When the ark of the LORD had been in the land<a name="fnB156" href="1sa_note.htm#fn156"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> of the Philistines for seven months,<a name="fnB157" href="1sa_note.htm#fn157"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  the Philistines called the priests and the omen readers, saying, "What should we do with the ark of the LORD? Advise us as to how we should send it back to its place."<p>

<bqverse 3>3  They replied, "If you are going to send the ark of<a name="fnB158" href="1sa_note.htm#fn158"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> the God of Israel back, don't send it away empty. Be sure to return it with a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and you will understand why his hand is not removed from you." 
<bqverse 4>4  They inquired, "What is the guilt offering that we should send to him?" <p>
They replied, "The Philistine leaders number five. So send five gold sores and five gold mice, for it is the same plague that has afflicted both you and your leaders. 
<bqverse 5>5  You should make images of the sores and images of the mice<a name="fnB159" href="1sa_note.htm#fn159"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> that are destroying the land. You should honor the God of Israel. Perhaps he will release his grip on you, your gods, and your land.<a name="fnB160" href="1sa_note.htm#fn160"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  Why harden your hearts like the Egyptians and Pharaoh did?<a name="fnB161" href="1sa_note.htm#fn161"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> When God<a name="fnB162" href="1sa_note.htm#fn162"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> treated them harshly, didn't the Egyptians send the Israelites on their way?<a name="fnB163" href="1sa_note.htm#fn163"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  So now go and make a new cart. Get two cows that have calves and that have never had a yoke placed on them. Harness the cows to the cart and take their calves from them back to their stalls. 
<bqverse 8>8  Then take the ark of the LORD and place it on the cart, and put in a chest beside it the gold objects you are sending to him as a guilt offering. You should then send it on its way. 
<bqverse 9>9  But keep an eye on it. If it should go up by the way of its own border to Beth Shemesh, then he has brought this great calamity on us. But if that is not the case, then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us; rather, it just happened to us by accident."<p>

<bqverse 10>10  So the men did as instructed.<a name="fnB164" href="1sa_note.htm#fn164"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> They took two cows that had calves and harnessed them to a cart; they also removed their calves to their stalls. 
<bqverse 11>11  They put the ark of the LORD on the cart, along with the chest, the gold mice, and the images of the sores. 
<bqverse 12>12  Then the cows went directly on the road to Beth Shemesh. They went along, mooing as they went; they turned neither to the right nor to the left. The leaders of the Philistines were walking along behind them all the way to the border of Beth Shemesh. <p>

<bqverse 13>13  Now the residents of Beth Shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley. When they looked up and saw the ark, they were pleased at the sight. 
<bqverse 14>14  The cart was coming to the field of Joshua, who was from Beth Shemesh. It paused there near a big stone. Then they cut up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD. 
<bqverse 15>15  The Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the chest that was with it, which contained the gold objects. They placed them near the big stone. At that time the people of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the LORD. 
<bqverse 16>16  The five leaders of the Philistines watched what was happening and then returned to Ekron on the same day. <p>

<bqverse 17>17  These are the gold sores that the Philistines brought as a guilt offering to the LORD--one for each of the following cities: Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron. 
<bqverse 18>18  The gold mice corresponded in number to all the Philistine cities of the five leaders, from the fortified cities to hamlet villages, to greater Abel,<a name="fnB165" href="1sa_note.htm#fn165"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> where they positioned the ark of the LORD until this very day in the field of Joshua who was from Beth Shemesh. <p>

<bqverse 19>19  But the LORD<a name="fnB166" href="1sa_note.htm#fn166"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> struck down some of the people of Beth Shemesh because they had looked into the ark of the LORD; he struck down 50,070<a name="fnB167" href="1sa_note.htm#fn167"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> of the men. The people grieved because the LORD had struck the people with a hard blow. 
<bqverse 20>20  The residents of Beth Shemesh asked, "Who is able to stand before the LORD, this holy God? To whom will it go up from here?"<p>

<bqverse 21>21  So they sent messengers to the residents of Kiriath Jearim, saying, "The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD. Come down here and take it back home with you." <p>

<bqchapter 7><A NAME="7"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>Then the people<a name="fnB168" href="1sa_note.htm#fn168"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> of Kiriath Jearim came and took the ark of the LORD; they brought it to the house of Abinadab located on the hill. They consecrated Eleazar his son to guard the ark of the LORD.<a name="_Toc494011881"></a></p>
<p><i>Further Conflict with the Philistines</i>
<p>
<bqverse 2>2  It was quite a long time--some twenty years in all--that the ark stayed at Kiriath Jearim. All the house of Israel longed for<a name="fnB169" href="1sa_note.htm#fn169"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD. 
<bqverse 3>3  Samuel said to all the house of Israel, "If you are really turning to the LORD with all your hearts, remove from among you the foreign gods and the images of Ashtoreth.<a name="fnB170" href="1sa_note.htm#fn170"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> Give your hearts to the LORD and serve only him. Then he will deliver you<a name="fnB171" href="1sa_note.htm#fn171"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> from the hand of the Philistines." 
<bqverse 4>4 So the people of Israel removed the Baals and images of Ashtoreth. They served only the LORD. <p>

<bqverse 5>5  Then Samuel said, "Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to the LORD on your behalf." 
<bqverse 6>6  After they had assembled at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before the LORD. They fasted on that day, and they confessed<a name="fnB172" href="1sa_note.htm#fn172"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> there, "We have sinned against the LORD." So Samuel led<a name="fnB173" href="1sa_note.htm#fn173"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> the people of Israel at Mizpah. <p>

<bqverse 7>7  When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, the leaders of the Philistines went up against Israel. When the Israelites heard about this, they were afraid of the Philistines. 
<bqverse 8>8  The Israelites said to Samuel, "Keep<a name="fnB174" href="1sa_note.htm#fn174"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> crying out to the LORD our<a name="fnB175" href="1sa_note.htm#fn175"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> God so that he may save us<a name="fnB176" href="1sa_note.htm#fn176"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> from the hand of the Philistines!" 
<bqverse 9>9  So Samuel took a nursing lamb<a name="fnB177" href="1sa_note.htm#fn177"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. Samuel cried out to the LORD on Israel's behalf, and the LORD answered him. <p>

<bqverse 10>10  As Samuel was offering burnt offerings, the Philistines approached to do battle with Israel.<a name="fnB178" href="1sa_note.htm#fn178"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> But on that day the LORD thundered loudly against the Philistines. He caused them to panic and they were defeated by<a name="fnB179" href="1sa_note.htm#fn179"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> Israel. 
<bqverse 11>11  Then the men of Israel left Mizpah and chased the Philistines, striking them down all the way to an area below Beth Car.<p>

<bqverse 12>12  Samuel took a stone and placed it between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer<a name="fnB180" href="1sa_note.htm#fn180"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> saying, "Up to here the LORD has helped us." 
<bqverse 13>13  So the Philistines were defeated; they did not again invade Israel. The hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. <p>

<bqverse 14>14  The cities that the Philistines had captured from Israel were returned to Israel, from Ekron to Gath. Israel also delivered their territory from the control<a name="fnB181" href="1sa_note.htm#fn181"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> of the Philistines. There was also peace between Israel and the Amorites. 
<bqverse 15>15  So Samuel led<a name="fnB182" href="1sa_note.htm#fn182"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> Israel all the days of his life. 
<bqverse 16>16  Year after year he used to travel the circuit of Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah; he used to judge Israel in all of these places. 
<bqverse 17>17  Then he would return to Ramah, because his home was there. He also judged Israel there and built there an altar to the LORD. 
<bqchapter 8>
<a name="_Toc494011882"></a></p>
<p><i>Israel Seeks a King</i>
<p><A NAME="8"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> In his old age Samuel appointed his sons as judges over Israel. 
<bqverse 2>2  The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second son was Abijah. They were judges in Beersheba. 
<bqverse 3>3  But his sons did not follow<a name="fnB183" href="1sa_note.htm#fn183"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> his ways. Instead, they made money dishonestly, accepted bribes, and perverted justice.<a name="fnB184" href="1sa_note.htm#fn184"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 4>4  So all the elders of Israel gathered together and approached Samuel at Ramah. 
<bqverse 5>5  They said to him, "Look, you are old, and your sons don't follow your ways. So now appoint over us a king to lead<a name="fnB185" href="1sa_note.htm#fn185"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> us, just like all the nations have." <p>

<bqverse 6>6  But this request displeased Samuel, for<a name="fnB186" href="1sa_note.htm#fn186"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> they said, "Give us a king to lead us." So Samuel prayed to the LORD. 
<bqverse 7>7  The LORD said to Samuel, "Do everything the people request of you.<a name="fnB187" href="1sa_note.htm#fn187"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> For it is not you that they have rejected, but it is me that they have rejected as their king. 
<bqverse 8>8  Just as they have done<a name="fnB188" href="1sa_note.htm#fn188"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a>from the day that I brought them up from Egypt until this very day, they have rejected me and have served other gods. This is what they are also doing to you. 
<bqverse 9>9  So now do as they say.<a name="fnB189" href="1sa_note.htm#fn189"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> But carefully warn<a name="fnB190" href="1sa_note.htm#fn190"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> them and make them aware of the policies of the king who will rule over them."<a name="fnB191" href="1sa_note.htm#fn191"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 10>10  So Samuel spoke all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking him for a king. 
<bqverse 11>11  He said, "Here are the policies of the king who will rule over you: he will conscript your sons and put them in his chariot forces and in his cavalry; they will run in front of his chariot. 
<bqverse 12>12  He will appoint for himself leaders of thousands and leaders of fifties,<a name="fnB192" href="1sa_note.htm#fn192"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> as well as those who plow his ground, reap his harvest, and make his weapons of war and his chariot equipment. 
<bqverse 13>13  He will take your daughters to be ointment makers, cooks, and bakers. 
<bqverse 14>14  He will take your best fields and vineyards and give them to his own servants. 
<bqverse 15>15  He will demand a tenth of your seed and of the produce of your vineyards and give it to his administrators<a name="fnB193" href="1sa_note.htm#fn193"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> and his servants. 
<bqverse 16>16  He will take both your male and female servants, as well as your best cattle and your donkeys, and assign them for his own use. 
<bqverse 17>17  He will demand a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will be his servants. 
<bqverse 18>18  In that day you will cry out because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the LORD won't answer you in that day."<a name="fnB194" href="1sa_note.htm#fn194"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 19>19  But the people refused to heed Samuel's warning.<a name="fnB195" href="1sa_note.htm#fn195"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> Instead they said, "No! There will be a king over us! 
<bqverse 20>20  We will be like all the nations. Our king will judge us and lead us<a name="fnB196" href="1sa_note.htm#fn196"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> and fight our battles." <p>

<bqverse 21>21  So Samuel listened to all the people said and then reported it to the LORD.<a name="fnB197" href="1sa_note.htm#fn197"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  The LORD said to Samuel, "Do as they say<a name="fnB198" href="1sa_note.htm#fn198"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> and install a king over them." Then Samuel said to the men of Israel, "Each of you go back to his city."
<bqchapter 9>
<a name="_Toc494011883"></a></p>
<p><i>Samuel Meets with Saul</i>
<p><A NAME="9"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> There was a Benjaminite man named Kish son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin. He was a prominent person. 
<bqverse 2>2  He had a son named Saul, an attractive young man. There was no one among the Israelites more attractive; he stood head and shoulders above all the people.<p>

<bqverse 3>3  The donkeys of Saul's father Kish wandered off,<a name="fnB199" href="1sa_note.htm#fn199"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> so Kish said to his son Saul, "Take one of the servants with you and go<a name="fnB200" href="1sa_note.htm#fn200"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> look for the donkeys."<a name="fnB201" href="1sa_note.htm#fn201"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  So he crossed through the hill country of Ephraim, passing through the land of Shalisha, but they did not find them. So they crossed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there. Then he crossed through the land of Benjamin, and still they did not find them. <p>

<bqverse 5>5  When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, "Come on, let's head back before my father quits worrying about the donkeys and becomes anxious about us." 
<bqverse 6>6  But the servant said to him, "Look, there is a man of God in this city. He is highly respected. Everything that he says really happens.<a name="fnB202" href="1sa_note.htm#fn202"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> Now let's go there. Perhaps he will tell us where we should go from here."<a name="fnB203" href="1sa_note.htm#fn203"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  So Saul said to his servant, "All right,<a name="fnB204" href="1sa_note.htm#fn204"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> we can go. But what can we bring the man, since the food in our bags is used up? We have no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?" 
<bqverse 8>8  The servant went on to answer Saul, "Look, I happen to have in my hand a quarter shekel<a name="fnB205" href="1sa_note.htm#fn205"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> of silver. I will give it to the man of God and he will tell us where we should go."<a name="fnB206" href="1sa_note.htm#fn206"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  (Now it used to be in Israel that whenever someone went to inquire of God he would say, "Come on, let's go to the seer." For today's prophet used to be called a seer.) 
<bqverse 10>10  So Saul said to his servant, "That's a good idea!<a name="fnB207" href="1sa_note.htm#fn207"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> Come on. Let's go." So they went to the city where the man of God was.<p>

<bqverse 11>11  As they were going up the ascent to the city, they met some girls coming out to draw water. They said to them, "Is this where the seer is?" 
<bqverse 12>12  They replied, "Yes, straight ahead. But hurry now, for he came to the city today, and the people are making a sacrifice at the high place. 
<bqverse 13>13  When you enter the city, you can find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people won't eat until he arrives, for he must bless the sacrifice. Once that happens, those who have been invited will eat. Now go on up, for<a name="fnB208" href="1sa_note.htm#fn208"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> this is the time when you can find him."<b> </b><p>

<bqverse 14>14  So they went up to the city. As they were heading for the middle of the city, Samuel was coming in their direction<a name="fnB209" href="1sa_note.htm#fn209"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> to go up to the high place. 
<bqverse 15>15  Now the day before Saul arrived, the LORD had told<a name="fnB210" href="1sa_note.htm#fn210"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> Samuel: 
<bqverse 16>16 "At this time tomorrow I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin. You must consecrate<a name="fnB211" href="1sa_note.htm#fn211"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> him as a leader over my people Israel. He will save my people from the hand of the Philistines. For I have looked with favor on my people. Their cry has reached me." <p>

<bqverse 17>17  When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said,<a name="fnB212" href="1sa_note.htm#fn212"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> "Here is the man that I told you about. He will rule over my people." 
<bqverse 18>18  As Saul approached Samuel in the middle of the gate, he said, "Please tell me where the seer's house is." <p>

<bqverse 19>19  Samuel replied to Saul, "I am the seer. "Go up in front of me to the high place. Today you will eat with me and in the morning I will send you away. I will tell you everything that you are thinking.<a name="fnB213" href="1sa_note.htm#fn213"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  Don't be concerned<a name="fnB214" href="1sa_note.htm#fn214"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> about the donkeys that you lost three days ago, for they have been found. Whom does all Israel desire? Is it not you, and all the house of your father?" <p>

<bqverse 21>21  Saul replied, "Am I not a Benjaminite, from the smallest of Israel's tribes, and is not my family clan the smallest of all the tribes of Benjamin? Why do you speak to me in this way?" <p>

<bqverse 22>22  Then Samuel brought<a name="fnB215" href="1sa_note.htm#fn215"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> Saul and his servant into the room and gave them a place at the head of those who had been invited. There were about thirty men present. 
<bqverse 23>23  Samuel said to the cook, "Give me the portion of food that I gave to you--the one I asked you to keep with you."<p>

<bqverse 24>24  So the cook picked up the leg and brought it and set it in front of Saul. Samuel<a name="fnB216" href="1sa_note.htm#fn216"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> said, "What was kept is now set before you. Eat, for it has been kept for you for this meeting time, from the time I said, `I have invited the people.'" So Saul ate with Samuel that day.<p>

<bqverse 25>25  When they came down from the high place to the city, Samuel spoke with Saul on the roof. 
<bqverse 26>26  They got up at dawn and Samuel called to Saul on the roof, "Get up, so I can send you on your way." So Saul got up and the two of them--he and Samuel--went outside. 
<bqverse 27>27  While they were going down to the city limits, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell the servant to go on ahead of us." So he did.<a name="fnB217" href="1sa_note.htm#fn217"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> Samuel then said,<a name="fnB218" href="1sa_note.htm#fn218"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> "You remain here awhile, so I can inform you of God's message."
<bqchapter 10>
<a name="_Toc494011884"></a></p>
<p><i>Samuel Anoints Saul</i>
<p><A NAME="10"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Then Samuel took a container of olive oil and poured it on Saul's<a name="fnB219" href="1sa_note.htm#fn219"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> head. Samuel<a name="fnB220" href="1sa_note.htm#fn220"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> kissed him and said, "The LORD has chosen you<a name="fnB221" href="1sa_note.htm#fn221"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> to lead his people Israel! You will rule over the LORD's people and you will deliver them from the power of the enemies who surround them. This will be your sign that the LORD has chosen<a name="fnB222" href="1sa_note.htm#fn222"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> you as leader over his inheritance.<a name="fnB223" href="1sa_note.htm#fn223"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  When you leave me today, you will find two men near Rachel's tomb on Benjamin's border at Zelzah. They will say to you, `The donkeys you have come looking for have been found. Your father is no longer concerned about the donkeys but has become anxious about you two.<a name="fnB224" href="1sa_note.htm#fn224"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> He is asking, "What should I do about my son?"'<p>

<bqverse 3>3  "As you continue on from there, you will come to the tall tree of Tabor. At that point three men who are going up to God at Bethel will meet you. One of them will be carrying three young goats, one of them will be carrying three round loaves of bread, and one of them will be carrying a container of wine. 
<bqverse 4>4  They will ask you how you're doing and will give you two loaves of bread. You will accept them. 
<bqverse 5>5  Afterwards you will go to Gibeah of God, where there are Philistine officials.<a name="fnB225" href="1sa_note.htm#fn225"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> When you enter the city, you will meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place. They will have harps, tambourines, flutes, and lyres, and they will be prophesying. 
<bqverse 6>6  Then the spirit of the LORD will rush upon you and you will prophesy with them. You will be changed into a different person. <p>

<bqverse 7>7  "When these signs have taken place, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God will be with you.<a name="fnB226" href="1sa_note.htm#fn226"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  You will go down to Gilgal before me. I am about to come down to you to offer burnt offerings and to make peace offerings. You should wait for seven days, until I come to you and tell you what to do." <a name="_Toc494011885"></a></p>
<p><i>Saul Becomes King</i>
<p>
<bqverse 9>9 As Saul<a name="fnB227" href="1sa_note.htm#fn227"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> turned<a name="fnB228" href="1sa_note.htm#fn228"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> to leave Samuel, God changed his thinking.<a name="fnB229" href="1sa_note.htm#fn229"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> All these signs happened on that very day. 
<bqverse 10>10 When they<a name="fnB230" href="1sa_note.htm#fn230"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> arrived at Gibeah,<b> </b>a company of prophets was coming out to meet him. Then the spirit of God rushed upon him and he prophesied among them. 
<bqverse 11>11  When everyone who had known him previously saw him prophesying with the prophets, the people all asked one another, "What on earth has happened to the son of Kish? Does even Saul belong with the prophets?"<p>

<bqverse 12>12  A man who was from there replied, "And who is their father?" Therefore this became a proverb: "Is even Saul among the prophets?" 
<bqverse 13>13  When Saul<a name="fnB231" href="1sa_note.htm#fn231"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> had finished prophesying, he went to the high place.<p>

<bqverse 14>14  Saul's uncle asked him and his servant, "Where did you go?" Saul<a name="fnB232" href="1sa_note.htm#fn232"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> replied, "To look for the donkeys. But when we realized they were lost,<a name="fnB233" href="1sa_note.htm#fn233"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> we went to Samuel." 
<bqverse 15>15  Saul's uncle said, "Tell me what Samuel said to you."<a name="fnB234" href="1sa_note.htm#fn234"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  Saul said to his uncle, "He assured us that the donkeys had been found." But Saul<a name="fnB235" href="1sa_note.htm#fn235"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> did not tell him what Samuel had said about the matter of kingship.<p>

<bqverse 17>17  Then Samuel called the people together before the LORD at Mizpah. 
<bqverse 18>18  He said to the Israelites, "This is what the LORD God of Israel says, `I brought Israel up from Egypt and I delivered you from the power<a name="fnB236" href="1sa_note.htm#fn236"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> of the Egyptians and from the power of all the kingdoms that oppressed you. 
<bqverse 19>19  But today you have rejected your God who saves you from all your trouble and distress. You have said, "No!<a name="fnB237" href="1sa_note.htm#fn237"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> Appoint a king over us." Now take your positions before the LORD by your tribes and by your clans.'"<p>

<bqverse 20>20  Then Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen by lot. 
<bqverse 21>21  Then he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by its families, and the family of Matri was chosen by lot. At last Saul son of Kish was chosen by lot. But when they looked for him, he was nowhere to be found. 
<bqverse 22>22  So they inquired again of the LORD, "Has the man arrived here yet?" The LORD said, "He has hidden himself among the equipment."<a name="fnB238" href="1sa_note.htm#fn238"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 23>23  So they ran and took him from there. When he took his position among the people, he stood head and shoulders above them all. 
<bqverse 24>24  Then Samuel said to all the people, "Do you see the one whom the LORD has chosen? Indeed, there is no one like him among all the people!" All the people shouted out, "Long live the king!" <p>

<bqverse 25>25  Then Samuel talked to the people about how the kingship would work.<a name="fnB239" href="1sa_note.htm#fn239"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> He wrote it all down on a scroll and set it before the LORD. Then Samuel sent all the people away to their homes. 
<bqverse 26>26  Even Saul went to his home in Gibeah. With him went some brave men whose hearts God had touched. 
<bqverse 27>27  But some wicked men<a name="fnB240" href="1sa_note.htm#fn240"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> said, "How can this man save us?" They despised him and did not even bring him a gift. But Saul said nothing about it.<a name="fnB241" href="1sa_note.htm#fn241"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Saul Comes to the Aid of Jabesh</i>
<p><A NAME="11"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b><a name="fnB242" href="1sa_note.htm#fn242"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> Nahash the Ammonite marched<a name="fnB243" href="1sa_note.htm#fn243"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> against Jabesh Gilead. All the men of Jabesh Gilead said to Nahash, "Make a treaty with us and we will serve you."<p>

<bqverse 2>2  But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, "The only way I will make a treaty with you is if I can gouge out the right eye of everyone and in so doing humiliate all Israel!" <p>

<bqverse 3>3  The elders of Jabesh said to him, "Leave us alone for seven days so that we can send messengers throughout the territory of Israel. If there is no one who can deliver us, we will come out voluntarily to you." <p>

<bqverse 4>4  When the messengers went to Gibeah (where Saul lived)<a name="fnB244" href="1sa_note.htm#fn244"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> and informed the people of these matters, all the people wept loudly.<a name="fnB245" href="1sa_note.htm#fn245"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  Now Saul was walking behind the<a name="fnB246" href="1sa_note.htm#fn246"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> oxen as he came from the field. Saul asked, "What has happened to the people? Why are they weeping?" So they told him the about<a name="fnB247" href="1sa_note.htm#fn247"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> the men of Jabesh. <p>

<bqverse 6>6  The Spirit of God rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and he became very angry. 
<bqverse 7>7  He took a pair<a name="fnB248" href="1sa_note.htm#fn248"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> of oxen and cut them up. Then he sent the pieces throughout the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, who said, "Whoever does not go out after Saul and after Samuel should expect this to be done to his oxen!" Then the terror of the LORD fell on the people, and they went out as one army.<a name="fnB249" href="1sa_note.htm#fn249"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  When Saul counted them at Bezek, the Israelites were three hundred thousand<a name="fnB250" href="1sa_note.htm#fn250"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> strong and the men of Judah numbered thirty thousand.<a name="fnB251" href="1sa_note.htm#fn251"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 9>9  They said to the messengers who had come, "Here's what you should say to the men of Jabesh Gilead: `Tomorrow deliverance will come to you when the sun is fully up.'" When the messengers went and told the men of Jabesh Gilead, they were happy. 
<bqverse 10>10  The men of Jabesh said, "Tomorrow we will come out to you<a name="fnB252" href="1sa_note.htm#fn252"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> and you can do with us whatever you wish."<a name="fnB253" href="1sa_note.htm#fn253"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 11>11  The next day Saul placed the people in three groups.

The survivors scattered; no two of them remained together.<a name="_Toc494011887"></a></p>
<p><i>Saul Is Established as King</i>
<p>
<bqverse 12>12  Then the people said to Samuel, "Who were the ones asking, `Will Saul reign over us?' Hand over those men so we may execute them!" 
<bqverse 13>13  But Saul said, "No one will be killed on this day. For today the LORD has given Israel a victory!" 
<bqverse 14>14  Samuel said to the people, "Come on! Let's go to Gilgal and renew the kingship there." 
<bqverse 15>15  So all the people went to Gilgal, where<a name="fnB255" href="1sa_note.htm#fn255"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> they established Saul as king in the LORD's presence. They offered up peace offerings there in the LORD's presence. Saul and all the Israelites were very happy.<p>

<bqchapter 12><A NAME="12"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Samuel said to all Israel, "I have done<a name="fnB256" href="1sa_note.htm#fn256"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> everything you requested.<a name="fnB257" href="1sa_note.htm#fn257"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> I have given you a king.<a name="fnB258" href="1sa_note.htm#fn258"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  Now look! This king walks before you. As for me, I am old and gray, though my sons are here with you. I have walked before you from the time of my youth till the present day. 
<bqverse 3>3  Here I am. Bring a charge against me before the LORD and before his chosen king.<a name="fnB259" href="1sa_note.htm#fn259"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I wronged? Whom have I oppressed? From whose hand have I taken a bribe so that I would overlook something? Tell me,<a name="fnB260" href="1sa_note.htm#fn260"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and I will return it to you!"<p>

<bqverse 4>4  They replied, "You have not wronged us or oppressed us. You have not taken anything from the hand of anyone." 
<bqverse 5>5  He said to them, "The LORD is witness against you, and his chosen king<a name="fnB261" href="1sa_note.htm#fn261"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> is witness this day, that you have not found any reason to accuse me."<a name="fnB262" href="1sa_note.htm#fn262"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> They said, "He is witness!" <p>

<bqverse 6>6  Samuel said to the people, "The LORD is the one who chose Moses and Aaron and who brought your ancestors<a name="fnB263" href="1sa_note.htm#fn263"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> up from the land of Egypt. 
<bqverse 7>7  Now take your positions, so I may confront you<a name="fnB264" href="1sa_note.htm#fn264"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> before the LORD regarding all the LORD's just actions toward you and your ancestors.<a name="fnB265" href="1sa_note.htm#fn265"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  When Jacob entered Egypt, your ancestors cried out to the LORD. The LORD sent Moses and Aaron, and they led your ancestors out of Egypt and settled them in this place.<p>

<bqverse 9>9  "But they forgot the LORD their God, so he gave<a name="fnB266" href="1sa_note.htm#fn266"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> them into the hand of Sisera, the general of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought with them. 
<bqverse 10>10  Then they cried out to the LORD saying, "We have sinned, for we have forsaken the LORD and have served the Baals and the images of Ashtoreth.<a name="fnB267" href="1sa_note.htm#fn267"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> Now deliver us from the hand of our enemies so that we may serve you.<a name="fnB268" href="1sa_note.htm#fn268"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  So the LORD sent Jerub-Baal,<a name="fnB269" href="1sa_note.htm#fn269"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> Barak,<a name="fnB270" href="1sa_note.htm#fn270"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> Jephthah, and Samuel,<a name="fnB271" href="1sa_note.htm#fn271"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> and he delivered you from the hand of the enemies all around you, and you were able to live securely.<p>

<bqverse 12>12  "When you saw that King Nahash of the Ammonites was advancing against you, you said to me, `No! A king will rule over us'--even though the LORD your God is your king! 
<bqverse 13>13  Now look! Here is the king you have chosen--the one that you asked for. Look, the LORD has given you a king. 
<bqverse 14>14  If you fear the LORD, serving him and obeying him<a name="fnB272" href="1sa_note.htm#fn272"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> and not rebelling against what he says,<a name="fnB273" href="1sa_note.htm#fn273"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and if both you and the king who rules over you follow the LORD your God, all will be well.<a name="fnB274" href="1sa_note.htm#fn274"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  But if you don't obey<a name="fnB275" href="1sa_note.htm#fn275"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD and rebel against what the LORD says, the hand of the LORD will be against both you and your king.<a name="fnB276" href="1sa_note.htm#fn276"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 16>16  "So now, take your positions and watch this great thing that the LORD is about to do in your sight. 
<bqverse 17>17  Is this not the time of the wheat harvest? I will call on the LORD so that he makes it thunder and rain. Realize and see what a great sin you have committed before the LORD by asking for a king for yourselves."<p>

<bqverse 18>18  So Samuel called to the LORD, and the LORD made it thunder and rain that day. All the people were very afraid of both the LORD and Samuel. 
<bqverse 19>19  All the people said to Samuel, "Pray to the LORD your God on behalf of your servants so we won't die, for we have added to all our sins by asking for a king."<a name="fnB277" href="1sa_note.htm#fn277"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 20>20  Then Samuel said to the people, "Don't fear. You have indeed sinned.<a name="fnB278" href="1sa_note.htm#fn278"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> However, don't turn aside from the LORD. Serve the LORD with all your heart. 
<bqverse 21>21  You should not turn aside after empty things that can't profit and can't deliver, since they are empty. 
<bqverse 22>22  The LORD will not abandon his people because he wants to uphold his great reputation.<a name="fnB279" href="1sa_note.htm#fn279"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> The LORD was pleased to make you his own people. 
<bqverse 23>23  As far as I am concerned, far be it from me to sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you. I will instruct you in the way that is good and upright. 
<bqverse 24>24  However, fear the LORD and serve him faithfully with all your heart. Just look at the great things he has done for you! 
<bqverse 25>25  But if you continue to do evil, both you and your king will be swept away."
<bqchapter 13>

<p><i>Saul Fails the LORD</i>
<p><A NAME="13"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Saul was [thirty]<a name="fnB280" href="1sa_note.htm#fn280"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> years old when he began to reign; he ruled over Israel for [forty]<a name="fnB281" href="1sa_note.htm#fn281"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> years. 
<bqverse 2>2  Saul selected for himself three thousand men from Israel. Two thousand of these were with Saul at Micmash and in the hill country of Bethel; the remaining thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah of Benjamin. He sent all the rest of the people back home.<a name="fnB282" href="1sa_note.htm#fn282"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 3>3  Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost<a name="fnB283" href="1sa_note.htm#fn283"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> that was at Geba and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul alerted<a name="fnB284" href="1sa_note.htm#fn284"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> all the land saying, "Let the Hebrews pay attention!" 
<bqverse 4>4  All Israel heard this message,<a name="fnB285" href="1sa_note.htm#fn285"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> "Saul has attacked the Philistine outpost, and now Israel is repulsive<a name="fnB286" href="1sa_note.htm#fn286"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> to the Philistines." So the people were summoned to join<a name="fnB287" href="1sa_note.htm#fn287"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> Saul at Gilgal. <p>

<bqverse 5>5  For the battle with Israel the Philistines had amassed three thousand chariots, six thousand horsemen, and an army as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Micmash, east of Beth Aven. 
<bqverse 6>6  The men of Israel realized they had a problem because their army was hard pressed. So the army hid in caves, thickets, cliffs, strongholds,<a name="fnB288" href="1sa_note.htm#fn288"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> and cisterns. 
<bqverse 7>7  Some of the Hebrews crossed over the Jordan River<a name="fnB289" href="1sa_note.htm#fn289"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> to the land of Gad and Gilead. But Saul stayed at Gilgal; the entire army that was with him was terrified. 
<bqverse 8>8  He waited for seven days, the time period indicated by Samuel.<a name="fnB290" href="1sa_note.htm#fn290"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> But Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the army began to abandon Saul.<a name="fnB291" href="1sa_note.htm#fn291"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 9>9  So Saul said, "Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings." Then he offered a burnt offering. 
<bqverse 10>10  When he had finished offering the burnt offering, Samuel appeared on the scene. Saul went out to meet him and to greet him.<a name="fnB292" href="1sa_note.htm#fn292"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 11>11  But Samuel said, "What have you done?" Saul replied, "When I saw that the army had started to abandon me<a name="fnB293" href="1sa_note.htm#fn293"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> and that you didn't come at the appointed time and that the Philistines had assembled at Micmash, 
<bqverse 12>12  I thought,<a name="fnB294" href="1sa_note.htm#fn294"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> `Now the Philistines will come down on me at Gilgal and I have not sought the LORD's favor.' So I was compelled<a name="fnB295" href="1sa_note.htm#fn295"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> to offer the burnt offering."<p>

<bqverse 13>13  Then Samuel said to Saul, "You have made a foolish choice! You have not obeyed<a name="fnB296" href="1sa_note.htm#fn296"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> the commandment that the LORD your God gave<a name="fnB297" href="1sa_note.htm#fn297"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> you. Had you done that, the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel forever. 
<bqverse 14>14  But now your kingdom will not continue. The LORD has sought out<a name="fnB298" href="1sa_note.htm#fn298"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> for himself a man who is loyal to him<a name="fnB299" href="1sa_note.htm#fn299"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> and the LORD has appointed<a name="fnB300" href="1sa_note.htm#fn300"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> him to be leader over his people, for you have not obeyed what the LORD commanded you." <p>

<bqverse 15>15  Then Samuel set out and went up from Gilgal<a name="fnB301" href="1sa_note.htm#fn301"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> to Gibeah of Benjamin. Saul mustered the army that remained with him; there were about six hundred men. 
<bqverse 16>16  Saul, his son Jonathan, and the army that remained with them stayed in Gibeah of Benjamin, while the Philistines camped in Micmash.<a name="fnB302" href="1sa_note.htm#fn302"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  Raiding bands went out from the camp of the Philistines in three groups. One band turned toward the road leading to Ophrah by the land of Shual; 
<bqverse 18>18  another band turned toward the road leading to Beth Horon; and yet another band turned toward the road leading to the border that overlooks the valley of Zeboim in the direction of the desert. <p>

<bqverse 19>19  A metalworker could not be found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines had said, "This will prevent the Hebrews from making swords and spears." 
<bqverse 20>20  So all Israel had to go down to the Philistines in order to get their plowshares, cutting instruments, axes, and sickles<a name="fnB303" href="1sa_note.htm#fn303"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> sharpened. 
<bqverse 21>21 They charged<a name="fnB304" href="1sa_note.htm#fn304"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a><sup> </sup>two-thirds of a shekel<a name="fnB305" href="1sa_note.htm#fn305"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> to sharpen plowshares and cutting instruments, and a third of shekel<a name="fnB306" href="1sa_note.htm#fn306"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> to sharpen picks and axes, and to set oxgoads. 
<bqverse 22>22  So on the day of the battle no sword or spear was to be found in the hand of anyone in the army that was with Saul and Jonathan. No one but Saul and his son Jonathan had them. <a name="_Toc494011889"></a></p>
<p><i>Jonathan Ignites a Battle</i>
<p>
<bqverse 23>23  A garrison of the Philistines had gone out to the pass at Micmash. 
<bqchapter 14><A NAME="14"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Then one day Jonathan son of Saul said to the servant who was carrying his equipment, "Come on, let's go over to the Philistine garrison that is opposite us." But he did not let his father know.<p>

<bqverse 2>2  Now Saul was sitting at the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron. The army that was with him numbered about six hundred men. 
<bqverse 3>3  Now Ahijah was bearing an ephod. He was the son of Ahitub, who was the brother of Ichabod and a son of Phineas, son of Eli, the priest of the LORD in Shiloh. The army was unaware that Jonathan had left.<p>

<bqverse 4>4  Now there was a steep cliff on each side of the pass through which Jonathan intended to go to reach the Philistine garrison. One cliff was named Bozez, the other Seneh. 
<bqverse 5>5  The cliff to the north was closer to Micmash, the one to the south closer to Geba. <p>

<bqverse 6>6  Jonathan said to his servant who was carrying his equipment, "Come on, let's go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised men. Perhaps the LORD will intervene<a name="fnB307" href="1sa_note.htm#fn307"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> for us. Nothing can prevent the LORD from delivering, whether by many or by a few." 
<bqverse 7>7  His armor bearer said to him, "Do everything that is on your mind."<a name="fnB308" href="1sa_note.htm#fn308"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> Do as you're inclined. I'm with you all the way."<a name="fnB309" href="1sa_note.htm#fn309"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 8>8  Jonathan replied, "All right!<a name="fnB310" href="1sa_note.htm#fn310"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> We'll go over to these men and fight them. 
<bqverse 9>9  If they say to us, `Stay put until we approach you,' we will stay<a name="fnB311" href="1sa_note.htm#fn311"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> right there and not go up to them. 
<bqverse 10>10  But if they say, `Come up against us,' we will go up. For in that case the LORD has given them into our hand--it will be a sign to us." <p>

<bqverse 11>11  When they<a name="fnB312" href="1sa_note.htm#fn312"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> made themselves known to the Philistine garrison, the Philistines said, "Look! The Hebrews are coming out of the holes in which they hid themselves." 
<bqverse 12>12  Then the men of the garrison said to Jonathan and his armor bearer, "Come on up to us so we can teach you a thing or two!"<a name="fnB313" href="1sa_note.htm#fn313"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> Then Jonathan said to his armor bearer, "Come up behind me, for the LORD has given<a name="fnB314" href="1sa_note.htm#fn314"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> them into the hand of Israel!" <p>

<bqverse 13>13  Jonathan crawled up on his hands and feet, with his armor bearer following behind him. Jonathan struck down the Philistines,<a name="fnB315" href="1sa_note.htm#fn315"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> while his armor bearer came along behind him and killed them.<a name="fnB316" href="1sa_note.htm#fn316"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  In this initial skirmish Jonathan and his armor bearer struck down about twenty men in an area that measured half an acre.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  Then fear overwhelmed<a name="fnB317" href="1sa_note.htm#fn317"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> those who were in the camp, those who were in the field, all the army in the garrison, and the raiding bands. They trembled and the ground shook. This fear was caused by God.<a name="fnB318" href="1sa_note.htm#fn318"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 16>16  Saul's watchmen in Gibeah in Benjamin looked on<a name="fnB319" href="1sa_note.htm#fn319"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> as the crowd of soldiers seemed to melt away first in one direction and then in another.<a name="fnB320" href="1sa_note.htm#fn320"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  So Saul said to the army that was with him, "Muster the troops and see who is no longer with us." When they mustered the troops,<a name="fnB321" href="1sa_note.htm#fn321"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there. 
<bqverse 18>18  So Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring near the ephod,"<a name="fnB322" href="1sa_note.htm#fn322"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> for he was at that time wearing the ephod.<a name="fnB323" href="1sa_note.htm#fn323"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  While<a name="fnB324" href="1sa_note.htm#fn324"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> Saul spoke to the priest, the panic in the Philistines' camp was getting greater and greater. So Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand." <p>

<bqverse 20>20  Saul and all the army that was with him assembled and marched into battle, where they found<a name="fnB325" href="1sa_note.htm#fn325"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> the Philistines in total panic killing one another with their swords.<a name="fnB326" href="1sa_note.htm#fn326"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  The Hebrews who had earlier gone over to the Philistine side<a name="fnB327" href="1sa_note.htm#fn327"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> joined the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. 
<bqverse 22>22  When all the Israelites who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines had fled, they too pursued them in battle. 
<bqverse 23>23  So the LORD delivered Israel that day, and the battle shifted over to Beth Aven.<a name="fnB328" href="1sa_note.htm#fn328"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> <a name="_Toc494011890"></a></p>
<p><i>Jonathan Violates Saul</i>'<i>s Oath</i>
<p>
<bqverse 24>24  Now the men of Israel were hard pressed that day, for Saul had made the army agree to this oath: "Cursed be the man who eats food before evening! I will get my vengeance on my enemies!" So none of the army ate anything. <p>

<bqverse 25>25  Now the whole army<a name="fnB329" href="1sa_note.htm#fn329"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> entered the forest and there was honey on the ground.<a name="fnB330" href="1sa_note.htm#fn330"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  When the army entered the forest, they saw<a name="fnB331" href="1sa_note.htm#fn331"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> the honey flowing, but no one ate any of it,<a name="fnB332" href="1sa_note.htm#fn332"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> for the army was afraid of the oath. 
<bqverse 27>27  But Jonathan had not heard about the oath his father made the army take. He extended the end of his staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb. When he ate it,<a name="fnB333" href="1sa_note.htm#fn333"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> his eyes gleamed.<a name="fnB334" href="1sa_note.htm#fn334"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  Then someone from the army informed him, "Your father put the army under a strict oath<a name="fnB335" href="1sa_note.htm#fn335"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> saying, `Cursed be the man who eats food today!' That is why the army is tired." 
<bqverse 29>29  Then Jonathan said, "My father has caused trouble for the land. See how my eyes gleamed<a name="fnB336" href="1sa_note.htm#fn336"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> when I tasted just a little of this honey. 
<bqverse 30>30  Certainly if the army had eaten some of the enemies' provisions that they came across today, then would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been even greater?" <p>

<bqverse 31>31  On that day the army struck down the Philistines from Micmash to Aijalon, and they became very tired. 
<bqverse 32>32  So the army rushed greedily on<a name="fnB337" href="1sa_note.htm#fn337"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> the<a name="fnB338" href="1sa_note.htm#fn338"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> plunder, confiscating sheep, cattle, and young cattle. They slaughtered them right on the ground, and the army ate them blood and all.<p>

<bqverse 33>33  Now it was reported to Saul, "Look, the army is sinning against the LORD by eating even the blood." He said, "All of you have broken the covenant!<a name="fnB339" href="1sa_note.htm#fn339"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> Roll a large stone over here to me." 
<bqverse 34>34  Then Saul said, "Scatter out among the army and say to them, `Each of you bring to me your ox and sheep and slaughter them in this spot and eat. But don't sin against the LORD by eating the blood." So that night each one brought his ox and slaughtered it there.<a name="fnB340" href="1sa_note.htm#fn340"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 35>35  Then Saul built an altar for the LORD; it was the first time he had built an altar for the LORD.<p>
 
<bqverse 36>36  Saul said, "Let's go down after the Philistines at night; we will rout<a name="fnB341" href="1sa_note.htm#fn341"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> them until the break of day.<a name="fnB342" href="1sa_note.htm#fn342"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> We won't leave any of them alive."<a name="fnB343" href="1sa_note.htm#fn343"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> They replied, "Do whatever seems best to you."<a name="fnB344" href="1sa_note.htm#fn344"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> But the priest said, "Let's approach God here." 
<bqverse 37>37  So Saul asked God, "Should I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?" But he did not answer him that day. <p>

<bqverse 38>38  Then Saul said, "All you heads of the army come here. Find out<a name="fnB345" href="1sa_note.htm#fn345"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> how this sin occurred today. 
<bqverse 39>39  For as surely as the LORD, the deliverer of Israel, lives, even if it turns out to be my own son Jonathan, he will certainly die!" But no one from the army said anything.<a name="fnB346" href="1sa_note.htm#fn346"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 40>40  Then he said to all Israel, "You will be on one side, and I and my son Jonathan will be on the other side." The army replied to Saul, "Do whatever you think is best."<p>

<bqverse 41>41  Then Saul said, "O LORD God of Israel! If this sin has been committed by me or by my son Jonathan, then, O LORD God of Israel, give Urim. But if this sin has been committed by your people Israel, give Thummim."<a name="fnB347" href="1sa_note.htm#fn347"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> Then Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, while the army was exonerated.<a name="fnB348" href="1sa_note.htm#fn348"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 42>42  Then Saul said, "Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan."<a name="fnB349" href="1sa_note.htm#fn349"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> Jonathan was taken by lot.<p>

<bqverse 43>43  So Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done." Jonathan told him, "I used the end of the staff that was in my hand to taste a little honey. I must die!"<a name="fnB350" href="1sa_note.htm#fn350"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 44>44  Saul said, "God will punish me severely if Jonathan doesn't die!"<a name="fnB351" href="1sa_note.htm#fn351"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 45>45 But the army said to Saul, "Should Jonathan, who won this great victory in Israel, die? May it never be! As surely as the LORD lives, not a single hair of his head will fall to the ground! For it is with the help of God that he has acted today." So the army rescued Jonathan from death.<a name="fnB352" href="1sa_note.htm#fn352"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 46>46  Then Saul stopped chasing the Philistines, and the Philistines went back home.<a name="fnB353" href="1sa_note.htm#fn353"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 47>47  After Saul had secured his royal position over Israel, he fought against all their<a name="fnB354" href="1sa_note.htm#fn354"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> enemies on all sides--the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. In every direction that he turned he was victorious.<a name="fnB355" href="1sa_note.htm#fn355"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 48>48  He fought bravely, striking down the Amalekites and delivering Israel from the hand of her enemies.<a name="fnB356" href="1sa_note.htm#fn356"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494011891"></a></p>
<p><i>Members of Saul</i>'<i>s Family</i>
<p>
<bqverse 49>49  The sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malki-Shua.<a name="fnB357" href="1sa_note.htm#fn357"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> He had two daughters; the older one was named Merab and the younger Michal. 
<bqverse 50>50  The name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the general of his army was Abner son of Ner, the uncle of Saul.<a name="fnB358" href="1sa_note.htm#fn358"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 51>51  Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son<a name="fnB359" href="1sa_note.htm#fn359"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> of Abiel.<p>

<bqverse 52>52  There was fierce war with the Philistines all the days of Saul. So whenever Saul saw anyone who was a warrior or a brave individual, he would conscript him.
<bqchapter 15>
<a name="_Toc494011892"></a></p>
<p><i>Saul is Rejected as King</i>
<p><A NAME="15"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Then Samuel said to Saul, "I was the one the LORD sent to anoint you as king over his people Israel. Now listen to what the LORD says.<a name="fnB360" href="1sa_note.htm#fn360"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2 Here is what the LORD of hosts says: `I carefully observed how the Amalekites opposed<a name="fnB361" href="1sa_note.htm#fn361"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> Israel along the way when Israel<a name="fnB362" href="1sa_note.htm#fn362"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> came up from Egypt. 
<bqverse 3>3  So go now and strike down the Amalekites. Destroy everything that they have. Don't spare<a name="fnB363" href="1sa_note.htm#fn363"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> them. Put them to death--man, woman, child, infant, ox, sheep, camel, and donkey alike.'" <p>

<bqverse 4>4  So Saul assembled<a name="fnB364" href="1sa_note.htm#fn364"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> the army<a name="fnB365" href="1sa_note.htm#fn365"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> and mustered them at Telaim. There were two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men of Judah. 
<bqverse 5>5  Saul proceeded to the city<a name="fnB366" href="1sa_note.htm#fn366"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> of Amalek, where he set an ambush<a name="fnB367" href="1sa_note.htm#fn367"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> in the wadi.<a name="fnB368" href="1sa_note.htm#fn368"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  Saul said to the Kenites, "Go on and leave! Go down from among the Amalekites! Otherwise I will sweep you away<a name="fnB369" href="1sa_note.htm#fn369"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> with them! After all, you were kind to all the Israelites when they came up from Egypt." So the Kenites withdrew from among the Amalekites.<p>

<bqverse 7>7  Then Saul struck down the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to<a name="fnB370" href="1sa_note.htm#fn370"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> Shur, which is next to Egypt. 
<bqverse 8>8  He captured King Agag of the Amalekites alive, but he executed all his people with the sword. 
<bqverse 9>9  However, Saul and the army spared Agag, and the best of the flock, the cattle, the fatlings,<a name="fnB371" href="1sa_note.htm#fn371"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> and the lambs, as well as everything else that was of value.<a name="fnB372" href="1sa_note.htm#fn372"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> They were not willing to slaughter them. But they did slaughter everything that was despised<a name="fnB373" href="1sa_note.htm#fn373"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> and worthless.<p>

<bqverse 10>10  Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel saying, 
<bqverse 11>11  "I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned away from me and has not done what I said." Samuel became angry and he cried out to the LORD all that night.<p>

<bqverse 12>12  Then Samuel got up early to meet Saul the next morning. But Samuel was informed, "Saul has gone to Carmel where<a name="fnB374" href="1sa_note.htm#fn374"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> he is setting up a monument for himself. Then Samuel left<a name="fnB375" href="1sa_note.htm#fn375"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> and went down to Gilgal."<a name="fnB376" href="1sa_note.htm#fn376"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  When Samuel came to him,<a name="fnB377" href="1sa_note.htm#fn377"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> Saul said to him, "May the LORD bless you! I have done what the LORD said." <p>

<bqverse 14>14  Samuel replied, "If that is the case,<a name="fnB378" href="1sa_note.htm#fn378"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> what then is this sound of sheep in my ears and the sound of cattle that I hear?" 
<bqverse 15>15  Saul said, "They were brought<a name="fnB379" href="1sa_note.htm#fn379"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> from the Amalekites; the army spared the best of the flocks and cattle to sacrifice to the LORD our God. But everything else we slaughtered." <p>

<bqverse 16>16  Then Samuel said to Saul, "Wait a minute!<a name="fnB380" href="1sa_note.htm#fn380"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> Let me tell you what the LORD said to me last night." He<a name="fnB381" href="1sa_note.htm#fn381"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> said to him, "Tell me." 
<bqverse 17>17  Samuel said, "Is it not true that when you were insignificant in your own eyes, you became head of the tribes of Israel? The LORD chose<a name="fnB382" href="1sa_note.htm#fn382"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> you as king over Israel. 
<bqverse 18>18  The LORD sent you on a campaign<a name="fnB383" href="1sa_note.htm#fn383"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> saying, `Go and exterminate those sinful Amalekites! Fight against them until you<a name="fnB384" href="1sa_note.htm#fn384"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> have destroyed them.' 
<bqverse 19>19  Why haven't you obeyed<a name="fnB385" href="1sa_note.htm#fn385"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD? Instead you have greedily rushed on the plunder. You have done what is wrong in the LORD's estimation."<a name="fnB386" href="1sa_note.htm#fn386"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 20>20  Then Saul said to Samuel, "But I have obeyed<a name="fnB387" href="1sa_note.htm#fn387"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD! I went on the campaign<a name="fnB388" href="1sa_note.htm#fn388"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD sent me on. I brought back King Agag of the Amalekites, after exterminating the Amalekites. 
<bqverse 21>21  But the army took from the plunder some of the sheep and cattle--the best of what was to be slaughtered--to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal."<p>

<bqverse 22>22  Then Samuel said, </p>
<br>"Does the LORD take pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices<br>
as much as he does in obedience?<a name="fnB389" href="1sa_note.htm#fn389"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> <br>
Certainly,<a name="fnB390" href="1sa_note.htm#fn390"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> obedience<a name="fnB391" href="1sa_note.htm#fn391"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> is better than sacrifice;<br>
paying attention is better than<a name="fnB392" href="1sa_note.htm#fn392"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> the fat of rams.<br>

<bqverse 23>23  For rebellion is like the sin of divination,<br>
and presumption is like the evil of idolatry.<br>
Because you have rejected the word of the LORD,<br>
he has rejected you as<a name="fnB393" href="1sa_note.htm#fn393"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> king."</ul><p>
<bqverse 24>24  Then Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned, for I have disobeyed what the LORD commanded<a name="fnB394" href="1sa_note.htm#fn394"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> and what you said as well.<a name="fnB395" href="1sa_note.htm#fn395"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> For I was afraid of the army, and I followed their wishes.<a name="fnB396" href="1sa_note.htm#fn396"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  Now please forgive my sin. Go back with me so I can worship<a name="fnB397" href="1sa_note.htm#fn397"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD."<p>

<bqverse 26>26  Samuel said to Saul, "I will not go back with you, for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel."<p>

<bqverse 27>27  When Samuel turned to leave, Saul<a name="fnB398" href="1sa_note.htm#fn398"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> grabbed the edge of his robe and it tore. 
<bqverse 28>28  Samuel said to him, "The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day and has given it to one of your colleagues who is better than you! 
<bqverse 29>29  The Preeminent One<a name="fnB399" href="1sa_note.htm#fn399"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> of Israel does not go back on his word<a name="fnB400" href="1sa_note.htm#fn400"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> or change his mind, for he is not a human being who changes his mind."<a name="fnB401" href="1sa_note.htm#fn401"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 30>30  Saul<a name="fnB402" href="1sa_note.htm#fn402"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> again replied, "I have sinned. But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel. Go back with me so I may worship the LORD your God." 
<bqverse 31>31  So Samuel followed Saul back, and Saul worshiped the LORD.<a name="_Toc494011893"></a></p>
<p><i>Samuel Puts Agag to Death</i>
<p>
<bqverse 32>32  Then Samuel said, "Bring me King Agag of the Amalekites." So Agag came to him trembling,<a name="fnB403" href="1sa_note.htm#fn403"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> thinking to himself,<a name="fnB404" href="1sa_note.htm#fn404"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> "Surely death is bitter!"<a name="fnB405" href="1sa_note.htm#fn405"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 33>33  Samuel said, "Just as your sword left women childless, so your mother will be the most bereaved among women." Then Samuel hacked Agag to pieces there in Gilgal before the LORD. <p>

<bqverse 34>34  Then Samuel went to Ramah, while Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul. 
<bqverse 35>35  Until the day he<a name="fnB406" href="1sa_note.htm#fn406"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> died Samuel did not see Saul again. Samuel did, however, mourn for Saul, but the LORD regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel.
<bqchapter 16>
<a name="_Toc494011894"></a></p>
<p><i>Samuel Anoints David as King</i>
<p><A NAME="16"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> The LORD said to Samuel, "How long do you intend to mourn for Saul? I have rejected him as king over Israel.<a name="fnB407" href="1sa_note.htm#fn407"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> Fill your horn with olive oil and go.

<bqverse 2>2  Samuel replied, "How can I go? Saul will hear about it and kill me!" But the LORD said, "Take a heifer with you<a name="fnB409" href="1sa_note.htm#fn409"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> and say, `I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.' 
<bqverse 3>3  Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you should do. You will anoint for me the one that I point out<a name="fnB410" href="1sa_note.htm#fn410"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> to you."<p>

<bqverse 4>4  Samuel did what the LORD told him.<a name="fnB411" href="1sa_note.htm#fn411"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> When he arrived in Bethlehem, the elders of the city were afraid to meet him. They<a name="fnB412" href="1sa_note.htm#fn412"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> said, "Do you come in peace?" 
<bqverse 5>5 He replied, "Yes, in peace. I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice." So he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.<p>

<bqverse 6>6  When they arrived, Samuel<a name="fnB413" href="1sa_note.htm#fn413"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> noticed<a name="fnB414" href="1sa_note.htm#fn414"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> Eliab and said, "Surely, here before the LORD stands his chosen king!"<a name="fnB415" href="1sa_note.htm#fn415"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  But the LORD said to Samuel, "Don't be impressed by<a name="fnB416" href="1sa_note.htm#fn416"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. God does not view things the way men do.<a name="fnB417" href="1sa_note.htm#fn417"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> People look on the outward appearance,<a name="fnB418" href="1sa_note.htm#fn418"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> but the LORD looks at the heart."<p>

<bqverse 8>8  Then Jesse called Abinadab and presented him to Samuel.<a name="fnB419" href="1sa_note.htm#fn419"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> But Samuel<a name="fnB420" href="1sa_note.htm#fn420"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> said, "The LORD has not chosen this one, either." 
<bqverse 9>9  Then Jesse presented<a name="fnB421" href="1sa_note.htm#fn421"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> Shammah. But Samuel said, "The LORD has not chosen this one, either." 
<bqverse 10>10  Jesse presented his seven sons to Samuel.<a name="fnB422" href="1sa_note.htm#fn422"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> But Samuel said to Jesse, "The LORD has not chosen any of these." 
<bqverse 11>11 Then Samuel said to Jesse, "Is that all of the boys?" Jesse<a name="fnB423" href="1sa_note.htm#fn423"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> replied, "There is still the youngest one. He is taking care of the flock." Samuel said to Jesse, "Send and get him, for we cannot turn our attention to other things until he comes here." <p>

<bqverse 12>12  So Jesse had him brought in.<a name="fnB424" href="1sa_note.htm#fn424"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> Now he was ruddy, with attractive eyes and a handsome appearance. The LORD said, "Go and anoint him. This is the one!" 
<bqverse 13>13  So Samuel took the horn full of olive oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. The Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David from that day onwards. Then Samuel got up and went to Ramah.<a name="_Toc494011895"></a></p>
<p><i>David Appears before Saul</i>
<p>
<bqverse 14>14  Now the Spirit of the LORD had turned away from Saul, and an evil spirit<a name="fnB425" href="1sa_note.htm#fn425"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> from the LORD tormented him. 
<bqverse 15>15  Then Saul's servants said to him, "Look, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you!" 
<bqverse 16>16  Let our lord instruct his servants who are here before you to look for a man who knows how to play the lyre. Then whenever the evil spirit from God comes upon you, he can play the lyre<a name="fnB426" href="1sa_note.htm#fn426"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> and you will feel better."<a name="fnB427" href="1sa_note.htm#fn427"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  So Saul said to his servants, "Find<a name="fnB428" href="1sa_note.htm#fn428"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> me a man who plays well and bring him to me." 
<bqverse 18>18  One of his attendants responded, "I have seen a son of Jesse in Bethlehem who knows how to play a lyre.

<bqverse 19>19  So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, "Send me your son David, who is out with the sheep. 
<bqverse 20>20  So Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a container of wine, and a young goat<a name="fnB432" href="1sa_note.htm#fn432"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> and sent them to Saul with<a name="fnB433" href="1sa_note.htm#fn433"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> his son David. 
<bqverse 21>21  David came to Saul and stood before him. Saul liked him a great deal,<a name="fnB434" href="1sa_note.htm#fn434"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> and he became his armor bearer. 
<bqverse 22>22  Then Saul sent word to Jesse saying, "Let David be my servant, for I like him."<a name="fnB435" href="1sa_note.htm#fn435"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 23>23  So whenever the spirit from God would come upon Saul, David would take his lyre and play it. This would bring relief to Saul and make him feel better. Then the evil spirit would leave him alone.<a name="fnB436" href="1sa_note.htm#fn436"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqchapter 17>
<a name="_Toc494011896"></a></p>
<p><i>David Kills Goliath</i>
<p><A NAME="17"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b><a name="fnB437" href="1sa_note.htm#fn437"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> The Philistines gathered their troops<a name="fnB438" href="1sa_note.htm#fn438"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> for battle. They assembled at Socoh in Judah. They camped in Ephes Dammim, between Socoh and Azekah. 
<bqverse 2>2  Saul and the men of Israel assembled and camped in the valley of Elah, where they arranged their battle lines to fight against<a name="fnB439" href="1sa_note.htm#fn439"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> the Philistines. 
<bqverse 3>3  The Philistines were standing on one hill, and the Israelites on another hill, with the valley between them. <p>

<bqverse 4>4  Then a champion<a name="fnB440" href="1sa_note.htm#fn440"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> from the camp of the Philistines came out. His name was Goliath; he was from Gath. He was close to seven feet tall.<a name="fnB441" href="1sa_note.htm#fn441"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  He had a bronze helmet on his head and was wearing scale body armor. The weight of his bronze body armor was five thousand shekels.<a name="fnB442" href="1sa_note.htm#fn442"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  He had bronze shin guards<a name="fnB443" href="1sa_note.htm#fn443"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> on his legs, and a bronze javelin was slung over his shoulders. 
<bqverse 7>7  The shaft<a name="fnB444" href="1sa_note.htm#fn444"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and the iron point of his spear weighed six hundred shekels.<a name="fnB445" href="1sa_note.htm#fn445"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> The shield bearer was going before him.<p>

<bqverse 8>8  He stood and called to Israel's troops,<a name="fnB446" href="1sa_note.htm#fn446"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> "Why do you come out to prepare for battle? Am I not the Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose<a name="fnB447" href="1sa_note.htm#fn447"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> for yourselves a man so he may come down<a name="fnB448" href="1sa_note.htm#fn448"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> to me! 
<bqverse 9>9  If he is able to fight with me and strike me down, we will become your servants. But if I prevail against him and strike him down, you will become our servants and will serve us." 
<bqverse 10>10  Then the Philistine said, "I defy Israel's troops this day! Give me a man so we can fight<a name="fnB449" href="1sa_note.htm#fn449"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> each other!" 
<bqverse 11>11  When Saul and all the Israelites<a name="fnB450" href="1sa_note.htm#fn450"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> heard these words of the Philistine, they were upset and very afraid.<p>

<bqverse 12>12 <a name="fnB451" href="1sa_note.htm#fn451"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> Now David was the son of this Ephrathite from Bethlehem in Judah whose name was Jesse. He had eight sons, and in Saul's days he was old and well advanced in years.<a name="fnB452" href="1sa_note.htm#fn452"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  Jesse's three oldest sons had followed Saul to war. The names of the<a name="fnB453" href="1sa_note.htm#fn453"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> three sons who went to war were Eliab, his firstborn, Abinadab, the second oldest, and Shammah, the third oldest. 
<bqverse 14>14  Now David was the youngest. While the three oldest sons followed Saul, 
<bqverse 15>15 David was going back and forth<a name="fnB454" href="1sa_note.htm#fn454"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> from Saul in order to care for his father's sheep in Bethlehem. <p>

<bqverse 16>16  Meanwhile for forty days the Philistine approached every morning and evening and took his position. 
<bqverse 17>17  Jesse said to his son David, "Take your brothers this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread; go quickly<a name="fnB455" href="1sa_note.htm#fn455"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> to the camp to your brothers. 
<bqverse 18>18  Also take these ten portions of cheese to their commanding officer.<a name="fnB456" href="1sa_note.htm#fn456"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> Find out how your brothers are doing<a name="fnB457" href="1sa_note.htm#fn457"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> and bring back their pledge that they received the goods.<a name="fnB458" href="1sa_note.htm#fn458"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines." <p>

<bqverse 20>20  So David got up early in the morning and entrusted the flock to a guard. After loading up, he went just as Jesse had instructed him. He arrived at the camp<a name="fnB459" href="1sa_note.htm#fn459"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> as the army was going out to the battle lines shouting its battle cry. 
<bqverse 21>21 Israel and the Philistines drew up their battle lines opposite one another. 
<bqverse 22>22  After David had entrusted his cargo to the care of the supply officer,<a name="fnB460" href="1sa_note.htm#fn460"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> he ran to the battle front. When he arrived, he asked his brothers how they were doing. 
<bqverse 23>23  As he was speaking with them, the champion named Goliath, the Philistine from Gath, was coming up from the battle lines of the Philistines. He spoke the way he usually did,<a name="fnB461" href="1sa_note.htm#fn461"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> and David heard it. 
<bqverse 24>24  When all the men of Israel saw this man, they retreated<a name="fnB462" href="1sa_note.htm#fn462"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> from his presence and were very afraid. <p>

<bqverse 25>25  The men of Israel said, "Have you seen this man who is coming up? He does so<a name="fnB463" href="1sa_note.htm#fn463"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> to defy Israel. But the king will make very wealthy the man who can strike him down. He will give him his daughter in marriage, and he will make his father's house exempt from tax obligations in Israel."<p>

<bqverse 26>26  David asked the men who were standing near him, "What will be done for the man who strikes down this Philistine and frees Israel from this humiliation?<a name="fnB464" href="1sa_note.htm#fn464"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he defies the armies of the living God?" 
<bqverse 27>27  The soldiers<a name="fnB465" href="1sa_note.htm#fn465"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> told him what had been promised saying,<a name="fnB466" href="1sa_note.htm#fn466"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> "This is what will be done for the man who can strike him down." <p>

<bqverse 28>28  When his oldest brother Eliab heard him speaking to the men, he became angry<a name="fnB467" href="1sa_note.htm#fn467"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> with David and said, "Why have you come down here? To whom did you entrust those few sheep in the desert? I am familiar with your pride and deceit.<a name="fnB468" href="1sa_note.htm#fn468"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> You have come down here to watch the battle!" <p>

<bqverse 29>29  David replied, "What have I done now? Can't I say anything?"<a name="fnB469" href="1sa_note.htm#fn469"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 30>30  Then he turned from those who were nearby to someone else and asked the same question,<a name="fnB470" href="1sa_note.htm#fn470"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> but they<a name="fnB471" href="1sa_note.htm#fn471"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> gave him the same answer as before. 
<bqverse 31>31  When David's words were overheard and reported to Saul, he called for him.<a name="fnB472" href="1sa_note.htm#fn472"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 32>32  David said to Saul, "Don't let anyone be discouraged.<a name="fnB473" href="1sa_note.htm#fn473"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> Your servant will go and fight this Philistine!" 
<bqverse 33>33 But Saul replied to David, "You aren't able to go against this Philistine and fight him! You're just a boy! He has been a warrior from his youth!"<p>

<bqverse 34>34  David replied to Saul, "Your servant has been a shepherd for his father's flock. Whenever a lion or bear would come and carry off a sheep from the flock, 
<bqverse 35>35  I would go out after it, strike it down, and rescue the sheep from its mouth. If it rose up against me, I would grab it by its jaw, strike it, and kill it. 
<bqverse 36>36  Your servant has struck down both the lion and the bear. This uncircumcised Philistine will be just like one of them.<a name="fnB474" href="1sa_note.htm#fn474"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> For he has defied the armies of the living God!" 
<bqverse 37>37  David went on to say, "The LORD who delivered me from the lion and the bear will also deliver me from the hand of this Philistine!" Then Saul said to David, "Go. The LORD will be with you."<a name="fnB475" href="1sa_note.htm#fn475"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 38>38  Then Saul clothed David with his own fighting attire and put a bronze helmet on his head. He also put body armor on him. 
<bqverse 39>39  David strapped on his sword over his fighting attire and tried to walk, but he was not used to them.<a name="fnB476" href="1sa_note.htm#fn476"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> David said to Saul, "I can't walk in these things, for I'm not used to them." So David removed them. 
<bqverse 40>40  He took his staff in his hand, picked out five smooth stones from the stream, placed them in the pouch<a name="fnB477" href="1sa_note.htm#fn477"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> of his shepherd's bag, took his sling in hand, and approached the Philistine.<p>

<bqverse 41>41 <a name="fnB478" href="1sa_note.htm#fn478"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> The Philistine kept coming closer to David, with his shield bearer going in front of him. 
<bqverse 42>42  When the Philistine looked carefully at David, he despised him, for he was only a ruddy and handsome boy. 
<bqverse 43>43  The Philistine said to David, "Am I a dog, that you are coming to me with sticks?"<a name="fnB479" href="1sa_note.htm#fn479"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> The Philistine cursed David by his gods. 
<bqverse 44>44  The Philistine said to David, "Come to me, so I can give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the wild animals of the field."<a name="fnB480" href="1sa_note.htm#fn480"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 45>45  But David replied to the Philistine, "You are coming against me with sword and spear and javelin. But I am coming against you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel's armies, whom you have defied. 
<bqverse 46>46  This very day the LORD will deliver you into my hand. I will strike you down and cut off your head. I will give the corpses of the camp of the Philistines this day to the birds of the sky and the wild animals of the land. Then all the land will realize that Israel has a God 
<bqverse 47>47 and all this assembly will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves. For the battle is the LORD's, and he will deliver you into our hand." <p>

<bqverse 48>48  The Philistine drew steadily closer to David to attack him, while David quickly ran toward the battle front to attack the Philistine.<a name="fnB481" href="1sa_note.htm#fn481"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 49>49  David reached his hand into the bag and took out a stone. He slung it, striking the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank deeply into his forehead, and he fell down with his face to the ground. <p>

<bqverse 50>50 <a name="fnB482" href="1sa_note.htm#fn482"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> David prevailed over the Philistine with just the sling and the stone. He struck down the Philistine and killed him. David did not even have a sword in his hand.<a name="fnB483" href="1sa_note.htm#fn483"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 51>51  David ran and stood over the Philistine. He grabbed Goliath's<a name="fnB484" href="1sa_note.htm#fn484"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> sword, drew it from its sheath,<a name="fnB485" href="1sa_note.htm#fn485"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they ran away.<p>

<bqverse 52>52  Then the men of Israel and Judah charged forward, shouting a war cry.<a name="fnB486" href="1sa_note.htm#fn486"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> They chased the Philistines to the valley<a name="fnB487" href="1sa_note.htm#fn487"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> and to the gates of Ekron. The Philistine corpses lay fallen along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron. 
<bqverse 53>53  When the Israelites returned from their hot pursuit of the Philistines, they looted their camp. 
<bqverse 54>54  David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, and he put Goliath's<a name="fnB488" href="1sa_note.htm#fn488"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> weapons in his tent. <p>

<bqverse 55>55 <a name="fnB489" href="1sa_note.htm#fn489"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> Now as Saul watched David going out to fight the Philistine, he asked Abner, the general of the army, "Whose son is this young man, Abner?" Abner replied, "As surely as you live, O king, I don't know." 
<bqverse 56>56  The king said, "Find out whose son this boy is." <p>

<bqverse 57>57  So when David returned from striking down the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul. He still had the head of the Philistine in his hand. 
<bqverse 58>58  Saul said to him, "Whose son are you, young man?" David replied, "I am the son of your servant Jesse in Bethlehem."

<p><i>Saul Comes to Fear David</i>
<p><A NAME="18"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> When he had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan and David became bound together in friendship.<a name="fnB490" href="1sa_note.htm#fn490"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> Jonathan loved David as much as he did his own life.<a name="fnB491" href="1sa_note.htm#fn491"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  Saul took David<a name="fnB492" href="1sa_note.htm#fn492"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> on that day and did not allow him to return to his father's house. 
<bqverse 3>3  Jonathan made a covenant with David, for he loved him as much as he did his own life.<a name="fnB493" href="1sa_note.htm#fn493"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with the rest of his gear, including his sword, his bow, and even his belt.<p>

<bqverse 5>5  On every mission on which Saul sent him, David acted wisely. So Saul appointed him over the men of war. This pleased not only all the army, but also the servants of Saul.<a name="fnB494" href="1sa_note.htm#fn494"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 6>6  When the men<a name="fnB495" href="1sa_note.htm#fn495"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> arrived after David returned from striking down the Philistine, the women from all the cities of Israel came out singing and dancing to meet King Saul. They were happy as they played their tambourines and three-stringed instruments.<a name="fnB496" href="1sa_note.htm#fn496"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  The women who were playing the music sang,</p>
<br>"Saul has struck down his thousands,<br>
but David his tens of thousands."</ul><p>
<bqverse 8>8  This made Saul very angry. The statement displeased him and he thought,<a name="fnB497" href="1sa_note.htm#fn497"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> "They have attributed to David tens of thousands, but to me they have attributed only thousands. What does he lack, except the kingdom?" 
<bqverse 9>9  So Saul was keeping an eye on David from that day onward. <p>

<bqverse 10>10  The next day an evil spirit from God rushed upon Saul and he prophesied within his house. Now David was playing the lyre<a name="fnB498" href="1sa_note.htm#fn498"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> that day. There was a spear in Saul's hand, 
<bqverse 11>11  and Saul threw the spear, thinking, "I'll nail David to the wall!" But David escaped from him on two different occasions.<p>

<bqverse 12>12  So Saul feared David, because the LORD was with him but had departed from Saul. 
<bqverse 13>13  Saul removed David<a name="fnB499" href="1sa_note.htm#fn499"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> from his presence and made him a commanding officer.<a name="fnB500" href="1sa_note.htm#fn500"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> David led the army out to battle and back.<a name="fnB501" href="1sa_note.htm#fn501"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  Now David acted wisely in all he did,<a name="fnB502" href="1sa_note.htm#fn502"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> for the LORD was with him. 
<bqverse 15>15  When Saul saw how very wise he was, he was afraid of him. 
<bqverse 16>16  But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he was the one leading them out to battle and back.<p>

<bqverse 17>17 <a name="fnB503" href="1sa_note.htm#fn503"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> Then Saul said to David, "Here's my oldest daughter, Merab. I want to give her to you in marriage. Only be a brave warrior<a name="fnB504" href="1sa_note.htm#fn504"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> for me and fight the battles of the LORD." For Saul thought, "There's no need for me to raise my hand against him. Let it be the hand of the Philistines!"<p>

<bqverse 18>18  David said to Saul, "Who am I? Who are my relatives or the clan of my father<a name="fnB505" href="1sa_note.htm#fn505"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> in Israel that I should become the king's son-in-law?" 
<bqverse 19>19 When the time came for Merab, Saul's daughter, to be given to David, she instead was given in marriage to Adriel, who was from Meholah.<p>

<bqverse 20>20  Now Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David. When they told Saul about this, it<a name="fnB506" href="1sa_note.htm#fn506"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> pleased him. 
<bqverse 21>21  Saul said, "I will give her to him so that she may become a snare to him and the hand of the Philistines may be against him." So Saul said to David, "Today is the second time for you to become my son-in-law."<a name="fnB507" href="1sa_note.htm#fn507"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 22>22  Then Saul instructed his servants, "Tell David secretly, `The king is pleased with you, and all his servants like you. So now become the king's son-in-law." 
<bqverse 23>23  So Saul's servants spoke these words privately<a name="fnB508" href="1sa_note.htm#fn508"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> to David. David replied, "Is becoming the king's son-in-law something insignificant to you? I'm just a poor and lightly-esteemed man!" <p>

<bqverse 24>24  When Saul's servants reported what David had said, 
<bqverse 25>25 Saul replied, "Here is what you should say to David: `There is nothing that the king wants as a price for the bride except a hundred Philistine foreskins, so that he can be avenged of his<a name="fnB509" href="1sa_note.htm#fn509"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> enemies.'" (Now Saul supposed that he could kill David by the hand of the Philistines.)<p>

<bqverse 26>26  So his servants told David these things and David agreed<a name="fnB510" href="1sa_note.htm#fn510"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> to become the king's son-in-law. Now the specified time had not yet expired<a name="fnB511" href="1sa_note.htm#fn511"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27 when David, along with his men, went out<a name="fnB512" href="1sa_note.htm#fn512"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> and struck down two hundred Philistine men. David brought their foreskins and presented all of them to the king so he could become the king's son-in-law. Saul then gave him his daughter Michal in marriage.<p>

<bqverse 28>28  When Saul realized<a name="fnB513" href="1sa_note.htm#fn513"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> that the LORD was with David and that his<a name="fnB514" href="1sa_note.htm#fn514"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> daughter Michal loved him, 
<bqverse 29>29  Saul was even more fearful of David. Saul continued to be at odds with David from then on.<a name="fnB515" href="1sa_note.htm#fn515"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 30>30 <a name="fnB516" href="1sa_note.htm#fn516"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> Then the leaders of the Philistines would march out, and as often as they did so, David was more successful than all of Saul's servants. His name was held in high esteem.

<p><i>Saul Repeatedly Attempts to Take David</i>'<i>s Life</i>
<p><A NAME="19"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Then Saul told his son Jonathan and all his servants to kill David. But Saul's son Jonathan liked David very much.<a name="fnB517" href="1sa_note.htm#fn517"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  So Jonathan told David, "My father Saul is trying<a name="fnB518" href="1sa_note.htm#fn518"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> to kill you. So be careful in the morning. Find<a name="fnB519" href="1sa_note.htm#fn519"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> a hiding place and stay in seclusion.<a name="fnB520" href="1sa_note.htm#fn520"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are. I will speak about you to my father. When I find out what the problem is,<a name="fnB521" href="1sa_note.htm#fn521"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> I will let you know."<p>

<bqverse 4>4  So Jonathan spoke on David's behalf<a name="fnB522" href="1sa_note.htm#fn522"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> to his father Saul. He said to him, "The king should not sin against his servant David, for he has not sinned against you. On the contrary, his actions have been very beneficial<a name="fnB523" href="1sa_note.htm#fn523"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> for you. 
<bqverse 5>5  He risked his life<a name="fnB524" href="1sa_note.htm#fn524"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> when he struck down the Philistine and the LORD gave all Israel a great victory. When you saw it, you were happy. So why would you sin against innocent blood by putting David to death for no reason?"<p>

<bqverse 6>6  Saul accepted Jonathan's advice<a name="fnB525" href="1sa_note.htm#fn525"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> and took an oath, "As surely as the LORD lives, he will not be put to death." 
<bqverse 7>7  Then Jonathan called David and told him all these things. Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he served him as he had done formerly.<a name="fnB526" href="1sa_note.htm#fn526"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 8>8  Now once again there was war. So David went out to fight the Philistines. He defeated them thoroughly<a name="fnB527" href="1sa_note.htm#fn527"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> and they fled from him. 
<bqverse 9>9  Then an evil spirit from the LORD came upon<a name="fnB528" href="1sa_note.htm#fn528"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> Saul. He was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, while David was playing the lyre with his hand. 
<bqverse 10>10  Saul tried to nail David to the wall with the spear, but he escaped from Saul's presence and the spear went into the wall.<a name="fnB529" href="1sa_note.htm#fn529"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> David escaped quickly<a name="fnB530" href="1sa_note.htm#fn530"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> that night.<p>

<bqverse 11>11  Saul sent messengers to David's house to guard it and to kill him in the morning. Then David's wife Michal told him, "If you do not save yourself<a name="fnB531" href="1sa_note.htm#fn531"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> tonight, tomorrow you will be dead!" 
<bqverse 12>12  So Michal lowered David through the window, and he fled and escaped.<p>

<bqverse 13>13  Then Michal took a household idol<a name="fnB532" href="1sa_note.htm#fn532"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> and put it on the bed. She put a quilt<a name="fnB533" href="1sa_note.htm#fn533"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> made of goat's hair over its head<a name="fnB534" href="1sa_note.htm#fn534"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and then covered the idol with a garment. 
<bqverse 14>14  When Saul sent messengers to arrest David, she said, "He's sick." <p>

<bqverse 15>15  Then Saul sent the messengers back to see David, saying, "Bring him up to me on his bed so I can kill him." 
<bqverse 16>16  When the messengers came, they found only the idol on the bed and the quilt made of goat's hair at its head.<p>

<bqverse 17>17  Saul said to Michal, "Why have you deceived me this way by sending my enemy away? Now he has escaped." Michal replied to Saul, "He said to me, `Help me get away or else I will kill you.'"<a name="fnB535" href="1sa_note.htm#fn535"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 18>18  Now David had fled and escaped. He went to Samuel in Ramah and told him everything that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went and stayed at Naioth. 
<bqverse 19>19  It was reported to Saul saying, "David is at Naioth in Ramah." 
<bqverse 20>20  So Saul sent messengers to capture David. When they saw a company of prophets prophesying with Samuel standing there as their leader, the spirit of God came upon Saul's messengers, and they too prophesied. 
<bqverse 21>21  When it was reported to Saul, he sent more messengers, but they too prophesied. So Saul sent messengers a third time, but they too prophesied. 
<bqverse 22>22  Then Saul<a name="fnB536" href="1sa_note.htm#fn536"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> himself went to Ramah. When he arrived at the large cistern that is in Secu, he asked, "Where are Samuel and David?" They said, "In Naioth at Ramah." <p>

<bqverse 23>23  So Saul went to Naioth at Ramah. The Spirit of God came upon him as well, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth at Ramah. 
<bqverse 24>24  He even stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel. He lay there<a name="fnB537" href="1sa_note.htm#fn537"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> naked all that day and night. For that reason it is asked, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"

<p><i>Jonathan Seeks to Protect David</i>
<p><A NAME="20"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> David fled from Naioth in Ramah. He came to Jonathan and asked,<a name="fnB538" href="1sa_note.htm#fn538"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> "What have I done? What have I done wrong?<a name="fnB539" href="1sa_note.htm#fn539"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> How have I sinned before your father? For he is seeking my life!" <p>

<bqverse 2>2  Jonathan<a name="fnB540" href="1sa_note.htm#fn540"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> said to him, "By no means are you going to die! My father does nothing<a name="fnB541" href="1sa_note.htm#fn541"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> large or small without making me aware of it.<a name="fnB542" href="1sa_note.htm#fn542"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> Why would my father hide this matter from me? It just won't happen!"<p>

<bqverse 3>3  Taking an oath, David again<a name="fnB543" href="1sa_note.htm#fn543"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> said, "Your father is very much aware of the fact<a name="fnB544" href="1sa_note.htm#fn544"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> that I have found favor with you, and he has thought,<a name="fnB545" href="1sa_note.htm#fn545"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> `Don't let Jonathan know about this, or he will be upset.' But as surely as both the LORD and you live, there is about one step between me and death!" 
<bqverse 4>4  Jonathan replied to David, "Tell me what I can do for you."<a name="fnB546" href="1sa_note.htm#fn546"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 5>5  David said to Jonathan, "Tomorrow is the new moon, and I am certainly expected to join the king for a meal.<a name="fnB547" href="1sa_note.htm#fn547"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> You must send me away so I can hide in the field until the third evening from now. 
<bqverse 6>6  If your father happens to miss me, you should say, `David urgently requested me to let him go<a name="fnB548" href="1sa_note.htm#fn548"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> to his city Bethlehem, for there is an annual sacrifice there for his entire family.' 
<bqverse 7>7  If he should then say, `That's fine,'<a name="fnB549" href="1sa_note.htm#fn549"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> then your servant is safe. But if he becomes very angry, be assured that he has decided to harm me.<a name="fnB550" href="1sa_note.htm#fn550"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  You must be loyal<a name="fnB551" href="1sa_note.htm#fn551"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> to your servant, for you have made a covenant with your servant in the LORD's name.<a name="fnB552" href="1sa_note.htm#fn552"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> If I am guilty,<a name="fnB553" href="1sa_note.htm#fn553"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> you yourself kill me! Why bother taking me to your father?"<p>

<bqverse 9>9  Jonathan said, "Far be it from you to suggest this! If I were at all aware that my father had decided to harm you, wouldn't I tell you about it?" 
<bqverse 10>10  David said to Jonathan, "Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?" 
<bqverse 11>11  Jonathan said to David, "Come on. Let's go out to the field."<p>
When the two of them had gone out into the field, 
<bqverse 12>12  Jonathan said to David, "The LORD God of Israel is my witness.<a name="fnB554" href="1sa_note.htm#fn554"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> I will feel out my father about this time the day after tomorrow. If he is favorably inclined toward David, will I not then send word to you and let you know?<a name="fnB555" href="1sa_note.htm#fn555"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13 But if my father intends to do you harm, may the LORD do all this and more to Jonathan, if I don't let you know<a name="fnB556" href="1sa_note.htm#fn556"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> and send word to you so you can go safely on your way.<a name="fnB557" href="1sa_note.htm#fn557"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> May the LORD be with you, as he was with my father. 
<bqverse 14>14  While I am still alive, extend to me the loyalty of the LORD, or else I will die. 
<bqverse 15>15 Don't ever cut off your loyalty to my family, not even when the LORD has cut off every one of David's enemies from the face of the earth 
<bqverse 16>16  and called David's enemies to account." So Jonathan made a covenant<a name="fnB558" href="1sa_note.htm#fn558"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> with the house of David.<a name="fnB559" href="1sa_note.htm#fn559"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  Jonathan once again took an oath with David, because he loved him. In fact Jonathan loved him as much as he did his own life.<a name="fnB560" href="1sa_note.htm#fn560"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  Jonathan said to him, "Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed, for your seat will be empty. 
<bqverse 19>19  On the third day<a name="fnB561" href="1sa_note.htm#fn561"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> you should go down quickly<a name="fnB562" href="1sa_note.htm#fn562"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> and come to the place where you hid yourself the day this all started.<a name="fnB563" href="1sa_note.htm#fn563"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> Stay near the stone Ezel. 
<bqverse 20>20  I will shoot three arrows near it, as though I were shooting at a target. 
<bqverse 21>21  When I send a boy after them, I will say, "Go and find the arrows." If I say to the boy, `Look, the arrows are on this side of you;<a name="fnB564" href="1sa_note.htm#fn564"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> get them,' then come. For as surely as the LORD lives, you will be safe and there will no problem. 
<bqverse 22>22  But if I say to the boy, "Look, the arrows are on the other side of you,'<a name="fnB565" href="1sa_note.htm#fn565"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> get away. For in that case the LORD has sent you away. 
<bqverse 23>23  With regard to the matter that you and I discussed, the LORD is the witness between us forever!"<a name="fnB566" href="1sa_note.htm#fn566"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 24>24  So David hid in the field. When the new moon came, the king sat down to eat his meal. 
<bqverse 25>25  The king sat down in his usual place by the wall, with Jonathan opposite him<a name="fnB567" href="1sa_note.htm#fn567"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> and Abner at his side.<a name="fnB568" href="1sa_note.htm#fn568"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> But David's place was vacant. 
<bqverse 26>26  However, Saul said nothing about it<a name="fnB569" href="1sa_note.htm#fn569"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> that day, for he thought,<a name="fnB570" href="1sa_note.htm#fn570"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> "Something has happened to make him ceremonially unclean. Yes, he must be unclean." 
<bqverse 27>27  But the next morning, the second day of the new moon, David's place was still vacant. So Saul said to his son Jonathan, "Why has Jesse's son not come to the meal yesterday or today?" <p>

<bqverse 28>28  Jonathan replied to Saul, "David urgently requested that he be allowed to go to Bethlehem. 
<bqverse 29>29  He said, `Permit me to go,<a name="fnB571" href="1sa_note.htm#fn571"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> for we are having a family sacrifice in the city, and my brother urged<a name="fnB572" href="1sa_note.htm#fn572"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> me to be there. So now, if I have found favor with you, let me go<a name="fnB573" href="1sa_note.htm#fn573"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> to see my brothers.' For that reason he has not come to the king's table."<p>

<bqverse 30>30  Saul became angry with Jonathan<a name="fnB574" href="1sa_note.htm#fn574"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> and said to him, "You stupid traitor!<a name="fnB575" href="1sa_note.htm#fn575"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> Don't I realize that to your own disgrace and to the disgrace of your mother's nakedness you have chosen this son of Jesse? 
<bqverse 31>31  For as long as<a name="fnB576" href="1sa_note.htm#fn576"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> this son of Jesse is alive on the earth, you and your kingdom will not be established. Now, send some men<a name="fnB577" href="1sa_note.htm#fn577"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> and bring him to me. For he is as good as dead!"<a name="fnB578" href="1sa_note.htm#fn578"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 32>32  Jonathan responded to his father Saul, "Why should he be put to death? What has he done?" 
<bqverse 33>33  Then Saul threw his spear at Jonathan<a name="fnB579" href="1sa_note.htm#fn579"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> in order to strike him down. So Jonathan was convinced<a name="fnB580" href="1sa_note.htm#fn580"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> that his father had decided to kill David. 
<bqverse 34>34  Jonathan got up from the table enraged. He did not eat any food on that second day of the new moon, for he was upset that his father had humiliated David.<a name="fnB581" href="1sa_note.htm#fn581"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 35>35  In the morning Jonathan, along with a young servant, went out to the field to meet David. 
<bqverse 36>36  He said to his servant, "Run, find the arrows that I am about to shoot." As the servant ran, Jonathan<a name="fnB582" href="1sa_note.htm#fn582"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> shot the arrow beyond him. 
<bqverse 37>37  When the servant came to the place where Jonathan had shot the arrow, Jonathan called out to<a name="fnB583" href="1sa_note.htm#fn583"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> the servant, "Isn't the arrow further beyond you?" 
<bqverse 38>38  Jonathan called out to the servant, "Hurry! Go faster! Don't pause!" Jonathan's servant retrieved the arrow and came back to his master. 
<bqverse 39>39  Now the servant did not understand any of this. Only Jonathan and David knew what was going on.<a name="fnB584" href="1sa_note.htm#fn584"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 40>40  Then Jonathan gave his equipment to the servant who was with him. He said to him, "Go, take these things back to the city."<p>

<bqverse 41>41  When the servant had left, David got up from beside the mound,<a name="fnB585" href="1sa_note.htm#fn585"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> knelt<a name="fnB586" href="1sa_note.htm#fn586"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> with his face to the ground, and bowed three times. Then they kissed each other and they both wept, especially David. 
<bqverse 42>42  Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, for the two of us have sworn together in the name of the LORD saying, `The LORD will be between me and you and between my descendants and your descendants forever.'"

<p><i>(21.1)</i><a name="fnB587" href="1sa_note.htm#fn587"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> Then David<a name="fnB588" href="1sa_note.htm#fn588"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> got up and left, while Jonathan went to the city. <A NAME="21"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b><i>(21.2)</i>David went to Ahimelech the priest in Nob. Ahimelech was afraid when he met<a name="fnB589" href="1sa_note.htm#fn589"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> David and said to him, "Why are you by yourself with no one accompanying you?" 
<bqverse 2>2  David replied to Ahimelech the priest, "The king instructed me to do something, but he said to me, `Don't let anyone know the reason I am sending you or the instructions I have given you.'<a name="fnB590" href="1sa_note.htm#fn590"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> I have told my soldiers<a name="fnB591" href="1sa_note.htm#fn591"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> to wait at a certain place.<a name="fnB592" href="1sa_note.htm#fn592"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  Now what do you have at your disposal?<a name="fnB593" href="1sa_note.htm#fn593"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever can be found."<p>

<bqverse 4>4  The priest replied to David, "I don't have any ordinary bread at my disposal. Only holy bread is available, and then only if the soldiers<a name="fnB594" href="1sa_note.htm#fn594"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> have abstained from women." 
<bqverse 5>5  David said to the priest, "Certainly women have been kept away from us, just as on previous occasions when I have gone out. The soldiers'<a name="fnB595" href="1sa_note.htm#fn595"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> equipment is holy, even on an ordinary journey. How much more so will they be holy today, along with their equipment!"<p>

<bqverse 6>6  So the priest gave him holy bread, for there was no bread there other than the bread of the Presence. It had been removed from before the LORD in order to replace it with hot bread on the day it had been taken. 
<bqverse 7>7  One of Saul's servants was there that day, detained before the LORD. His name was Doeg the Edomite, who was in charge of Saul's shepherds. 
<bqverse 8>8  David said to Ahimelech, "Is there no sword or spear here at your disposal? I don't have my own sword or equipment in hand due to the urgency of the king's instructions."<a name="_Toc494011901"></a></p>
<p><i>David Goes to Gath</i>
<p>
<bqverse 9>9  The priest replied, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you struck down in the valley of Elah, is wrapped in a garment behind the ephod. If you wish, take it for yourself. Other than that there's nothing here." David said, "There's nothing like it! Give it to me!" 
<bqverse 10>10  So on that day David arose and fled from Saul. He went to King Achish of Gath. 
<bqverse 11>11  The servants of Achish said to him, "Isn't this David, the king of the land? Isn't he the one that they sing about when they dance, saying,</p>
<br>"Saul struck down his thousands,<br>

<bqverse 12>12  David thought about what they said<a name="fnB596" href="1sa_note.htm#fn596"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and was very fearful of King Achish of Gath. 
<bqverse 13>13  He altered his behavior in their presence.<a name="fnB597" href="1sa_note.htm#fn597"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> Since he was in their power,<a name="fnB598" href="1sa_note.htm#fn598"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> he pretended to be insane, making marks on the doors of the gate and making his saliva run down his beard.<p>

<bqverse 14>14  Achish said to his servants, "Look at this insane man! Why did you bring him to me? 
<bqverse 15>15  Am I lacking in fools, that you have brought me this man to display his insanity in front of me? Should this man enter my house?"</p>

<a name="_Toc494011902"></a>David Goes to Adullam and Mizpah</i>
<p><A NAME="22"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>So David<b> </b>left there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his father's family<a name="fnB599" href="1sa_note.htm#fn599"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> learned about it, they went down there to him. 
<bqverse 2>2  All those who were in trouble or owed someone money or were discontented<a name="fnB600" href="1sa_note.htm#fn600"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> gathered around<a name="fnB601" href="1sa_note.htm#fn601"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> him, and he became their leader. He had about four hundred men with him. <p>

<bqverse 3>3  Then David went from there to Mizpah in Moab, where he said to the king of Moab, "Please let my father and mother stay<a name="fnB602" href="1sa_note.htm#fn602"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> with you until I know what God is going to do for me." 
<bqverse 4>4  So he had them stay with the king of Moab; they stayed with him the whole time<a name="fnB603" href="1sa_note.htm#fn603"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> that David was in the stronghold. 
<bqverse 5>5  Then Gad the prophet said to David, "Don't stay in the stronghold. Go to the land of Judah." So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.<a name="_Toc494011903"></a></p>
<p><i>Saul Executes the Priests</i>
<p>
<bqverse 6>6  But Saul found out the whereabouts of David and the men who were with him.<a name="fnB604" href="1sa_note.htm#fn604"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> Now Saul was sitting at Gibeah under the tamarisk tree at an elevated location with his spear in hand and all his servants stationed around him. 
<bqverse 7>7  Saul said to his servants who were stationed around him, "Listen up, you Benjaminites! Is Jesse's son giving fields and vineyards to all of you? Or is he making all of you<a name="fnB605" href="1sa_note.htm#fn605"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> commanders and officers?<a name="fnB606" href="1sa_note.htm#fn606"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  For all of you have conspired against me. No one informs me<a name="fnB607" href="1sa_note.htm#fn607"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> when my own son makes an agreement with this son of Jesse. Not one of you feels sorry for me or informs me that my own son has commissioned my own servant to hide in ambush against me, as is the case today."<p>

<bqverse 9>9  But Doeg the Edomite, who had stationed himself with the servants of Saul, replied, "I saw this son of Jesse come to Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob. 
<bqverse 10>10  He inquired of the LORD for him and gave him provisions. He also gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."<p>

<bqverse 11>11  Then the king arranged for a meeting with the priest Ahimelech son of Ahitub and all the priests of his father's house who were at Nob. They all came to the king. 
<bqverse 12>12  Then Saul said, "Listen, son of Ahitub." He replied, "Here I am, my lord." 
<bqverse 13>13  Saul said to him, "Why have you conspired against me, you and this son of Jesse? You gave<a name="fnB608" href="1sa_note.htm#fn608"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> him bread and a sword and inquired of God on his behalf, so that he opposes<a name="fnB609" href="1sa_note.htm#fn609"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> me and waits in ambush, as is the case today?"<p>

<bqverse 14>14 Ahimelech replied to the king, "Who among all your servants is faithful like David? He is the king's son-in-law, the leader of your bodyguard, and honored in your house. 
<bqverse 15>15  Was it just today that I began to inquire of God on his behalf? Far be it from me! The king should not accuse<a name="fnB610" href="1sa_note.htm#fn610"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> his servant or all my father's house. For your servant is not aware of all this--not in whole nor in part."<a name="fnB611" href="1sa_note.htm#fn611"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 16>16 But the king said, "You will surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father's house! 
<bqverse 17>17  Then the king said to the messengers<a name="fnB612" href="1sa_note.htm#fn612"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> who were stationed beside him, "Turn and kill the priests of the LORD. For they too have sided<a name="fnB613" href="1sa_note.htm#fn613"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> with David. They knew he was fleeing, but they did not inform me." But the king's servants refused to harm<a name="fnB614" href="1sa_note.htm#fn614"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> the priests of the LORD.<p>

<bqverse 18>18  Then the king said to Doeg, "You turn and strike down the priests." So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck down the priests. He killed on that day eighty-five<a name="fnB615" href="1sa_note.htm#fn615"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> men who wore the linen ephod. 
<bqverse 19>19  As for Nob, the city of the priests, he struck down with the sword men and women, children and infants, oxen, donkeys, and sheep--all with the sword.<p>

<bqverse 20>20  But one of the sons of Ahimelech son of Ahitub escaped and fled to David. His name was Abiathar. 
<bqverse 21>21  Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD. 
<bqverse 22>22 Then David said to Abiathar, "I knew that day when Doeg the Edomite was there that he would certainly tell Saul. I am guilty<a name="fnB616" href="1sa_note.htm#fn616"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> of all the deaths in your father's house. 
<bqverse 23>23  Stay with me. Don't be afraid. Whoever<a name="fnB617" href="1sa_note.htm#fn617"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> seeks my life is seeking your life as well. You are secure with me."

<a name="_Toc494011904"></a></p>
<p><i>David Delivers the City of Keilah</i>
<p><A NAME="23"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> They told David, "The Philistines are fighting in Keilah and are looting the threshing floors." 
<bqverse 2>2  So David asked the LORD, "Should I go and strike down these Philistines?" The LORD said to David, "Go, strike down the Philistines and deliver Keilah."<p>

<bqverse 3>3  But David's men said to him, "We are afraid while we are still here in Judah! What will it be like if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?" 
<bqverse 4>4  So David asked the LORD once again. But the LORD replied, "Arise, go down to Keilah. For I will give the Philistines into your hand."<p>

<bqverse 5>5  So David and his men went to Keilah and fought the Philistines. He took away their cattle and thoroughly defeated them.<a name="fnB618" href="1sa_note.htm#fn618"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> David delivered the inhabitants of Keilah.<a name="_Toc494011905"></a></p>
<p><i>David Eludes Saul Again</i>
<p>
<bqverse 6>6  Now when Abiathar son of Ahimelech had fled to David at Keilah, he had brought with him an ephod.<a name="fnB619" href="1sa_note.htm#fn619"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  When Saul was told that David had come to Keilah, Saul said, "God has delivered<a name="fnB620" href="1sa_note.htm#fn620"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> him into my hand, for he has boxed himself into a corner by entering a city with two doors and a bar." 
<bqverse 8>8  So Saul mustered all his army to go down to Keilah and besiege David and his men.<a name="fnB621" href="1sa_note.htm#fn621"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 9>9  When David realized that Saul was planning to harm him,<a name="fnB622" href="1sa_note.htm#fn622"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> he told Abiathar the priest, "Bring the ephod." 
<bqverse 10>10  Then David said, "O LORD God of Israel, your servant has clearly heard that Saul is planning<a name="fnB623" href="1sa_note.htm#fn623"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> to come to Keilah to destroy the city because of me. 
<bqverse 11>11  Will the leaders of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Saul come down as your servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, please inform your servant."<p>
Then the LORD said, "He will come down." 
<bqverse 12>12  David asked, "Will the leaders of Keilah deliver me and my men into Saul's hand?" The LORD said, "They will deliver you over." <p>

<bqverse 13>13  So David and his men, who numbered about six hundred, set out and left Keilah; they moved around from one place to another.<a name="fnB624" href="1sa_note.htm#fn624"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> When told that David had escaped from Keilah, Saul called a halt to his expedition. 
<bqverse 14>14  David stayed in the strongholds that were in the desert and in the hill country of the desert of Ziph. Saul looked for him all the time,<a name="fnB625" href="1sa_note.htm#fn625"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> but God did not deliver David<a name="fnB626" href="1sa_note.htm#fn626"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> into his hand. 
<bqverse 15>15  David realized<a name="fnB627" href="1sa_note.htm#fn627"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> that Saul had come out to seek his life; at that time David was in Horesh in the desert of Ziph. <p>

<bqverse 16>16  Then Jonathan son of Saul left and went to David at Horesh. He encouraged him<a name="fnB628" href="1sa_note.htm#fn628"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> through God. 
<bqverse 17>17  He said to him, "Don't fear. For the hand of my father Saul cannot find you. You will rule over Israel, and I will be your second in command. Even my father Saul realizes this." 
<bqverse 18>18  When the two of them had made a covenant before the LORD, David stayed on at Horesh, but Jonathan went to his house.<p>

<bqverse 19>19  Then the Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah saying, "Isn't David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh on the hill of Hakilah, which is south of Jeshimon? 
<bqverse 20>20  Now at your own discretion,<a name="fnB629" href="1sa_note.htm#fn629"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> O king, come down. Delivering him into the king's hand will be our responsibility."<p>

<bqverse 21>21  Saul replied, "May you be blessed by the LORD, for you have had compassion on me. 
<bqverse 22>22  Go and make further arrangements. Determine precisely<a name="fnB630" href="1sa_note.htm#fn630"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> where he is<a name="fnB631" href="1sa_note.htm#fn631"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> and who has seen him there. For I am told that he is extremely cunning. 
<bqverse 23>23  Locate precisely all the places where he hides and return to me with dependable information.<a name="fnB632" href="1sa_note.htm#fn632"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> Then I will go with you. If he is in the land, I will find him<a name="fnB633" href="1sa_note.htm#fn633"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> among all the thousands of Judah."<p>

<bqverse 24>24  So they left and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the desert of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon. 
<bqverse 25>25  Saul and his men went to look for him.<a name="fnB634" href="1sa_note.htm#fn634"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> But David was informed and went down to the rock and stayed in the desert of Maon. When Saul heard about it, he pursued David in the desert of Maon. 
<bqverse 26>26  Saul went on one side of the mountain, while David and his men went on the other side of the mountain. David was hurrying to get away from Saul, but Saul and his men were surrounding David and his men so they could capture them. 
<bqverse 27>27  But a messenger came to Saul saying, "Come quickly, for the Philistines have raided the land!"<p>

<bqverse 28>28  So Saul stopped pursuing David and went to confront the Philistines. Therefore that place is called Sela Hammahlekoth.<a name="fnB635" href="1sa_note.htm#fn635"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 29>29 <i>(24.1)</i><a name="fnB636" href="1sa_note.htm#fn636"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> Then David went up from there and stayed in the strongholds of En Gedi. 
<bqchapter 24>
<a name="_Toc494011906"></a></p>
<p><i>David Spares Saul</i>'<i>s Life</i>
<p><A NAME="24"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b><i>(24.2)</i>When Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, they told him, "Look, David is in the desert of En Gedi." 
<bqverse 2>2  So Saul took three thousand select men from all Israel and went to find<a name="fnB637" href="1sa_note.htm#fn637"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> David and his men in the region of<a name="fnB638" href="1sa_note.htm#fn638"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> the rocks of the mountain goats.<a name="fnB639" href="1sa_note.htm#fn639"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  He came to the sheepfolds by the road, where there was a cave. Saul went into it to relieve himself.<a name="fnB640" href="1sa_note.htm#fn640"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a><p>
Now David and his men were sitting in the recesses of the cave. 
<bqverse 4>4  David's men said to him, "This is the day about which the LORD said to you, `I will give your enemy into your hand, and you can do to him whatever seems appropriate to you.'"<a name="fnB641" href="1sa_note.htm#fn641"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> So David got up and quietly cut off an edge of Saul's robe. 
<bqverse 5>5  Afterwards David's conscience bothered him<a name="fnB642" href="1sa_note.htm#fn642"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> because he had cut off an edge of Saul's robe. 
<bqverse 6>6  He said to his men, "May the LORD keep me far away from doing such a thing to my lord, who is the LORD's chosen one,<a name="fnB643" href="1sa_note.htm#fn643"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> by extending my hand against him. After all,<a name="fnB644" href="1sa_note.htm#fn644"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> he is the LORD's chosen one."<a name="fnB645" href="1sa_note.htm#fn645"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  David restrained his men with these words and did not allow them to rise up against Saul. Then Saul left the cave and started down<a name="fnB646" href="1sa_note.htm#fn646"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> the road.<p>

<bqverse 8>8  Afterwards David got up and went out of the cave. He called out after Saul, "My lord, O king!" When Saul looked behind him, David bowed his face to the ground and kneeled down. 
<bqverse 9>9  David said to Saul, "Why do you pay attention when men say, `David is seeking to do you harm'? 
<bqverse 10>10  Today your own eyes see how the LORD delivered you--this very day--into my hands in the cave. Someone told me to kill you, but I had pity<a name="fnB647" href="1sa_note.htm#fn647"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> on you and said, `I will not extend my hand against my lord, for he is the LORD's chosen one.'<a name="fnB648" href="1sa_note.htm#fn648"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  Look, my father, and see the edge of your robe in my hand. When I cut off the edge of your robe, I didn't kill you. So realize and understand that I am not planning<a name="fnB649" href="1sa_note.htm#fn649"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> evil or rebellion. Even though I have not sinned against you, you are waiting in ambush to take my life. 
<bqverse 12>12  May the LORD judge between the two of us, and may the LORD vindicate me over you, but my hand will not be against you. 
<bqverse 13>13 It's like the old proverb says, `From evil people evil proceeds." But my hand will not be against you. 
<bqverse 14>14  Who has the king of Israel come out after? Who is it that you are pursuing? A dead dog? A single flea? 
<bqverse 15>15 May the LORD be our judge and arbiter. May he see and arbitrate my case and deliver me from your hands!"<p>

<bqverse 16>16  When David finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, "Is that your voice, my son David?" Then Saul wept loudly.<a name="fnB650" href="1sa_note.htm#fn650"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17 He said to David, "You are more innocent<a name="fnB651" href="1sa_note.htm#fn651"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> than I, for you have treated me well, even though I have tried to harm you. 
<bqverse 18>18  You have explained today how you have treated me well. The LORD delivered me into your hand, but you did not kill me. 
<bqverse 19>19  Now if a man finds his enemy, does he send him on his way in good shape? May the LORD repay you with good this day for what you have done to me. 
<bqverse 20>20  Now look, I realize that you will in fact be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand. 
<bqverse 21>21  So now swear to me in the LORD's name<a name="fnB652" href="1sa_note.htm#fn652"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> that you will not kill<a name="fnB653" href="1sa_note.htm#fn653"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> my descendants after me or destroy my name from the house of my father." <p>

<bqverse 22>22  David promised Saul this on oath.<a name="fnB654" href="1sa_note.htm#fn654"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> Then Saul went to his house, and David and his men went up to the stronghold.

<p><i>The Death of Samuel </i>
<p><A NAME="25"><b>

<p><i>David Marries Abigail the Widow of Nabal</i>
<p>
<bqverse 2>2  There was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel. This man was very wealthy;<a name="fnB655" href="1sa_note.htm#fn655"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> he owned three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. At that time he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. 
<bqverse 3>3  The man's name was Nabal,<a name="fnB656" href="1sa_note.htm#fn656"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> and his wife's name was Abigail. She was both wise<a name="fnB657" href="1sa_note.htm#fn657"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> and beautiful, but the man was harsh and his deeds were evil. He was a Calebite.<p>

<bqverse 4>4  When David heard in the desert that Nabal was shearing his sheep, 
<bqverse 5>5  he<a name="fnB658" href="1sa_note.htm#fn658"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> sent ten servants,<a name="fnB659" href="1sa_note.htm#fn659"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> saying to them,<a name="fnB660" href="1sa_note.htm#fn660"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> "Go up to Carmel to see Nabal and give him greetings in my name.<a name="fnB661" href="1sa_note.htm#fn661"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  Then you will say to my brother,<a name="fnB662" href="1sa_note.htm#fn662"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> "Peace to you and your house! Peace to all that is yours! 
<bqverse 7>7  Now I hear that they are shearing for you. When your shepherds were with us, we neither insulted them nor harmed them the whole time they were in Carmel. 
<bqverse 8>8  Ask your own servants; they can tell you! May the servants find favor in your sight, for we have come<a name="fnB663" href="1sa_note.htm#fn663"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> on a holiday. Please provide your servants<a name="fnB664" href="1sa_note.htm#fn664"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and your son David with whatever you can spare."<a name="fnB665" href="1sa_note.htm#fn665"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 9>9  So David's servants went and spoke all these words to Nabal in David's name. Then they paused. 
<bqverse 10>10  But Nabal responded to David's servants, "Who is David, and who is this son of Jesse? This is a time when many servants are breaking away from their masters. 
<bqverse 11>11  Should I take my bread and my water and my meat that I have slaughtered for my shearers and give them to these men? I don't even know where they came from!"<p>

<bqverse 12>12  So David's servants went on their way. When they had returned, they came and told David<a name="fnB666" href="1sa_note.htm#fn666"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> all these things. 
<bqverse 13>13  Then David instructed his men, "Each of you strap on your sword!" So each one strapped on his sword, and David also strapped on his sword. About four hundred men followed David up, while two hundred stayed behind with the equipment.<p>

<bqverse 14>14  But one of the servants told Nabal's wife Abigail, "David sent messengers from the desert to greet<a name="fnB667" href="1sa_note.htm#fn667"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> our lord, but he screamed at them. 
<bqverse 15>15  These men were very good to us. They did not insult us, nor did we sustain any loss during the entire time we were together<a name="fnB668" href="1sa_note.htm#fn668"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> in the field. 
<bqverse 16>16  Both night and day they were a protective wall for us the entire time we were with them, while we were tending our flocks. 
<bqverse 17>17  Now be aware of this, and see what you can do. For disaster has been planned for our lord and all his house. He is such a wicked person<a name="fnB669" href="1sa_note.htm#fn669"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> that no one tell him anything!"<p>

<bqverse 18>18  So Abigail quickly took two hundred loaves of bread, two containers<a name="fnB670" href="1sa_note.htm#fn670"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> of wine, five prepared sheep, five seahs<a name="fnB671" href="1sa_note.htm#fn671"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> of roasted grain, a hundred bunches of raisins, and two hundred lumps of pressed figs. She loaded them on donkeys 
<bqverse 19>19  and said to her servants, "Go on ahead of me. I will come after you." But she did not tell her husband Nabal.<p>

<bqverse 20>20  Riding on her donkey, she went down under cover of the mountain. David and his men were coming down to meet her, and she encountered them. 
<bqverse 21>21  Now David had been thinking,<a name="fnB672" href="1sa_note.htm#fn672"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> "In vain I guarded everything that belonged to this man in the desert. I didn't take anything from him. But he has repaid my good with evil. 
<bqverse 22>22  God will severely punish David,<a name="fnB673" href="1sa_note.htm#fn673"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> if I leave alive until morning even one male<a name="fnB674" href="1sa_note.htm#fn674"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> from all those who belong to him!"<p>

<bqverse 23>23  When Abigail saw David, she quickly got down from the donkey, fell down before David, and bowed to the ground. 
<bqverse 24>24  Falling at his feet, she said, "My lord, I accept all the guilt. But please let your female servant speak with my lord. Please listen to the words of your servant. 
<bqverse 25>25  My lord should not pay attention to this wicked man Nabal. He simply lives up to his name! His name means `fool,' and he is indeed foolish.<a name="fnB675" href="1sa_note.htm#fn675"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> But I, your servant, did not see the servants my lord sent.<a name="fnB676" href="1sa_note.htm#fn676"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 26>26  "Now my lord, as surely as the LORD lives and as surely as you live, it is the LORD who has kept you from shedding blood and taking matters into your own hands. Now may your enemies and those who seek to harm my lord be like Nabal. 
<bqverse 27>27  Now let this present<a name="fnB677" href="1sa_note.htm#fn677"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> that your servant has brought to my lord be given to the servants who follow<a name="fnB678" href="1sa_note.htm#fn678"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> my lord. 
<bqverse 28>28  Please forgive the sin of your servant, for the LORD will certainly establish the house of my lord, because my lord fights the battles of the LORD. May no evil be found in you all your days. 
<bqverse 29>29  When someone sets out to chase you and to take your life, the life of my lord will be wrapped securely in the bag of the living by the LORD your God. But he will sling away the lives of your enemies from the sling's pocket. 
<bqverse 30>30  The LORD will do for my lord everything that he promised you,<a name="fnB679" href="1sa_note.htm#fn679"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> and he will make<a name="fnB680" href="1sa_note.htm#fn680"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> you a leader over Israel. 
<bqverse 31>31  Your conscience will not be overwhelmed with guilt<a name="fnB681" href="1sa_note.htm#fn681"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> for having poured out innocent blood and for having taken matters into your own hands. When the LORD has granted my lord success,<a name="fnB682" href="1sa_note.htm#fn682"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> please remember your servant."<p>

<bqverse 32>32  Then David said to Abigail, "Praised<a name="fnB683" href="1sa_note.htm#fn683"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> be the LORD, the God of Israel, who has sent you this day to meet me! 
<bqverse 33>33  Praised be your good judgment! May you yourself be rewarded<a name="fnB684" href="1sa_note.htm#fn684"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> for having prevented me this day from shedding blood and taking matters into my own hands. 
<bqverse 34>34  Otherwise, as surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives--he who has prevented me from harming you--if you had not come so quickly to meet me, by morning's light not even one male belonging to Nabal would have remained alive." 
<bqverse 35>35  Then David took from her hand what she had brought to him. He said to her, "Go back<a name="fnB685" href="1sa_note.htm#fn685"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> to your home in peace. Be assured that I have listened to you<a name="fnB686" href="1sa_note.htm#fn686"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> and responded favorably."<a name="fnB687" href="1sa_note.htm#fn687"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 36>36  When Abigail went back to Nabal, he was holding a banquet in his house like that of the king. Nabal was having a good time<a name="fnB688" href="1sa_note.htm#fn688"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> and was very intoxicated. She told him absolutely nothing<a name="fnB689" href="1sa_note.htm#fn689"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> until morning's light. 
<bqverse 37>37  In the morning, when Nabal was sober,<a name="fnB690" href="1sa_note.htm#fn690"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> his wife told him about these matters. He had a stroke and was paralyzed.<a name="fnB691" href="1sa_note.htm#fn691"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 38>38  After about ten days the LORD struck Nabal down and he died.<p>

<bqverse 39>39  When David heard that Nabal had died, he said, "Praised be the LORD who has vindicated me and avenged the insult that I suffered from Nabal.<a name="fnB692" href="1sa_note.htm#fn692"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> The LORD has kept his servant from doing evil, and he has repaid Nabal for his evil deeds."<a name="fnB693" href="1sa_note.htm#fn693"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> Then David sent word to Abigail and asked her to become his wife.<p>

<bqverse 40>40  So the servants of David went to Abigail at Carmel and said to her, "David has sent us to you to bring you back to be his wife." 
<bqverse 41>41  She arose, bowed her face toward the ground, and said, "Your female servant, like a lowly servant, will wash<a name="fnB694" href="1sa_note.htm#fn694"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> the feet of the servants of my lord." 
<bqverse 42>42  Then Abigail quickly went and mounted her donkey, with five of her female servants accompanying her.<a name="fnB695" href="1sa_note.htm#fn695"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> She followed David's messengers and became his wife.<p>

<bqverse 43>43  David had also married<a name="fnB696" href="1sa_note.htm#fn696"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> Ahinoam from Jezreel; the two of them became his wives. 
<bqverse 44>44  Now Saul had given his daughter Michal, David's wife, to Paltiel son of Laish, who was from Gallim.
<bqchapter 26>
<a name="_Toc494011909"></a></p>
<p><i>David Spares Saul</i>'<i>s Life Again</i>
<p><A NAME="26"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> The Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah and said, "Isn't David hiding on the hill of Hakilah near<a name="fnB697" href="1sa_note.htm#fn697"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> Jeshimon?" 
<bqverse 2>2  So Saul arose and went down to the desert of Ziph, accompanied by three thousand select men of Israel, to look for David in the desert of Ziph. 
<bqverse 3>3  Saul camped by the road on the hill of Hakilah near Jeshimon, but David was staying in the desert. When he realized that Saul had come to the desert to find<a name="fnB698" href="1sa_note.htm#fn698"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> him, 
<bqverse 4>4  David sent scouts and verified that Saul had indeed arrived.<a name="fnB699" href="1sa_note.htm#fn699"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 5>5  So David set out and went to the place where Saul was camped. David saw the place where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the general of his army, were sleeping. Now Saul was lying in the entrenchment, and the army was camped all around him. 
<bqverse 6>6  David said to Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, "Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?" Abishai replied, "I will go down with you."<p>

<bqverse 7>7  So David and Abishai approached the army at night and found Saul lying asleep in the entrenchment with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. Abner and the army were lying all around him. 
<bqverse 8>8  Abishai said to David, "Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Now let me drive the spear right through him into the ground with one swift jab!<a name="fnB700" href="1sa_note.htm#fn700"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> A second jab won't be necessary!" <p>

<bqverse 9>9  But David said to Abishai, "Don't kill him! Who can extend his hand against the LORD's chosen one<a name="fnB701" href="1sa_note.htm#fn701"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and remain guiltless?" 
<bqverse 10>10  David went on to say, "As the LORD lives, the LORD himself will strike him down. Either his day will come and he will die, or he will go down into battle and be swept away. 
<bqverse 11>11  But may the LORD prevent me from extending my hand against the LORD's chosen one. Now take the spear by Saul's head and the jug of water, and let's get out of here!" 
<bqverse 12>12  So David took the spear and the jug of water by Saul's head, and they got out of there. No one saw them or was aware of their presence or woke up. All of them were asleep, for the LORD had caused a deep sleep to fall on them.<p>

<bqverse 13>13  Then David crossed to the other side and stood on the top of the hill some distance away; there was a considerable space between them. 
<bqverse 14>14  David called to the army and to Abner son of Ner, "Won't you answer, Abner?" Abner replied, "Who are you, that you have called to the king?" 
<bqverse 15>15  David said to Abner, "Aren't you a man? After all, who is like you in Israel? Why then haven't you protected your lord the king? One of the soldiers came to kill your lord the king. 
<bqverse 16>16  This failure on your part isn't good.<a name="fnB702" href="1sa_note.htm#fn702"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> As surely as the LORD lives, you people who have not protected your lord, the LORD's chosen one, are as good as dead.<a name="fnB703" href="1sa_note.htm#fn703"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> Now look where the king's spear and the jug of water that was by his head are!"<p>

<bqverse 17>17  When Saul recognized David's voice, he said, "Is that your voice, my son David?" David replied, "Yes, it's my voice, my lord the king." 
<bqverse 18>18  He went on to say, "Why is my lord chasing his servant? What have I done? What wrong have I done?<a name="fnB704" href="1sa_note.htm#fn704"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  So let my lord the king now listen to the words of his servant. If the LORD has incited you against me, may he take delight in<a name="fnB705" href="1sa_note.htm#fn705"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> an offering. But if men have instigated this,<a name="fnB706" href="1sa_note.htm#fn706"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> may they be cursed before the LORD! For they have driven me away this day from being united with the LORD's inheritance, saying, `Go on, serve other gods!' 
<bqverse 20>20  Now don't let my blood fall to the ground away from the LORD's presence, for the king of Israel has gone out to look for a flea the way one looks for a partridge<a name="fnB707" href="1sa_note.htm#fn707"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> in the hill country." <p>

<bqverse 21>21  Saul replied, "I have sinned. Come back, my son David. I won't harm you, for you treated my life with value<a name="fnB708" href="1sa_note.htm#fn708"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> this day. I have behaved foolishly and have made a very terrible mistake."<a name="fnB709" href="1sa_note.htm#fn709"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  David replied, "Here is the king's spear." Let one of the servants cross over and get it. 
<bqverse 23>23  The LORD rewards each man for his integrity and loyalty.<a name="fnB710" href="1sa_note.htm#fn710"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> Even though today the LORD delivered you into my hand, I was not willing to extend my hand against the LORD's chosen one. 
<bqverse 24>24  In the same way that I valued your life this day,<a name="fnB711" href="1sa_note.htm#fn711"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> may the LORD value my life<a name="fnB712" href="1sa_note.htm#fn712"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> and deliver me from all danger." 
<bqverse 25>25  Saul replied to David, "May you be rewarded,<a name="fnB713" href="1sa_note.htm#fn713"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> my son David. You will without question be successful."<a name="fnB714" href="1sa_note.htm#fn714"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.
<bqchapter 27>
<a name="_Toc494011910"></a></p>
<p><i>David Aligns Himself with the Philistines</i>
<p><A NAME="27"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> David thought to himself,<a name="fnB715" href="1sa_note.htm#fn715"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> "One of these days I'm going to be swept away by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will despair of searching for me through all the territory of Israel and I will escape from his hand."<p>

<bqverse 2>2  So David left and crossed over to King Achish son of Maoch of Gath accompanied by six hundred men. 
<bqverse 3>3  David settled with Achish in Gath, along with his men and their families.<a name="fnB716" href="1sa_note.htm#fn716"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> David had with him his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail the Carmelite, Nabal's widow. 
<bqverse 4>4  When Saul learned that David had fled to Gath, he did not mount a new search for him.<p>

<bqverse 5>5  David said to Achish, "If I have found favor with you, let me be given a place in one of the country towns so that I can live there. Why should your servant settle in the royal city with you?" 
<bqverse 6>6  So Achish gave him Ziklag on that day. (For that reason Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah until this very day.) 
<bqverse 7>7  The length of time<a name="fnB717" href="1sa_note.htm#fn717"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> that David lived in the Philistine countryside was a year<a name="fnB718" href="1sa_note.htm#fn718"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> and four months.<p>

<bqverse 8>8  Then David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. (They had been living in that land for a long time, from the entrance<a name="fnB719" href="1sa_note.htm#fn719"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> to Shur as far as the land of Egypt.) 
<bqverse 9>9  When David would attack a district,<a name="fnB720" href="1sa_note.htm#fn720"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> he would leave neither man nor woman alive. He would take sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, and clothing and would then go back to Achish. 
<bqverse 10>10  When Achish would ask, "Where<a name="fnB721" href="1sa_note.htm#fn721"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> did you raid today?" David would say, "The Negev of Judah" or "The Negev of Jeharmeel" or "The Negev of the Kenites." 
<bqverse 11>11 Neither man nor woman would David leave alive so as to bring them back to Gath. He was thinking, "This way they can't tell on us, saying, `Here is what David did.'" Such was his practice the entire time<a name="fnB722" href="1sa_note.htm#fn722"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> that he lived in the field of the Philistines. 
<bqverse 12>12  So Achish trusted David, thinking to himself<a name="fnB723" href="1sa_note.htm#fn723"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> "He is really hated<a name="fnB724" href="1sa_note.htm#fn724"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> among his own people in<a name="fnB725" href="1sa_note.htm#fn725"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> Israel. From now on<a name="fnB726" href="1sa_note.htm#fn726"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> he will be my servant."
<bqchapter 28>
<a name="_Toc494011911"></a></p>
<p><i>The Witch of Endor</i>
<p><A NAME="28"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> In those days the Philistines gathered their troops<a name="fnB727" href="1sa_note.htm#fn727"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> for war in order to fight Israel. Achish said to David, "You should fully understand that you and your men must go with me into the battle."<a name="fnB728" href="1sa_note.htm#fn728"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  David replied to Achish, "That being the case, you will come to know what your servant can do!" Achish said to David, "Then I will make you my bodyguard<a name="fnB729" href="1sa_note.htm#fn729"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> from now on."<a name="fnB730" href="1sa_note.htm#fn730"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 3>3  Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had lamented over him and had buried him in Ramah, his hometown.<a name="fnB731" href="1sa_note.htm#fn731"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> In the meantime Saul had removed the mediums<a name="fnB732" href="1sa_note.htm#fn732"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> and magicians<a name="fnB733" href="1sa_note.htm#fn733"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> from the land. 
<bqverse 4>4  The Philistines gathered; they came and camped at Shunem. Saul assembled all Israel and camped at Gilboa. 
<bqverse 5>5  When Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he was absolutely terrified.<a name="fnB734" href="1sa_note.htm#fn734"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  So Saul inquired of the LORD, but the LORD did not answer him--not by dreams nor by Urim<a name="fnB735" href="1sa_note.htm#fn735"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> nor by the prophets. 
<bqverse 7>7  So Saul instructed his servants, "Find for me a woman who is a medium,<a name="fnB736" href="1sa_note.htm#fn736"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> so that I may go to her and inquire of her." His servants replied to him, "There is a woman who is a medium in Endor."<p>

<bqverse 8>8  So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothing and left, accompanied by two of his men. They came to the woman at night and said, "Use your ritual pit to conjure up for me the one I tell you."<a name="fnB737" href="1sa_note.htm#fn737"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 9>9  But the woman said to him, "Look, you are aware of what Saul has done; he has removed<a name="fnB738" href="1sa_note.htm#fn738"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> the mediums and magicians<a name="fnB739" href="1sa_note.htm#fn739"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> from the land. Why are you trapping me<a name="fnB740" href="1sa_note.htm#fn740"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> so you can put me to death?" 
<bqverse 10>10  But Saul swore an oath to her by the LORD, "As surely as the LORD lives, you will not incur guilt in this matter." 
<bqverse 11>11  The woman replied, "Who is it that I should bring up for you?" He said, "Bring up for me Samuel."<p>

<bqverse 12>12  When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out loudly.<a name="fnB741" href="1sa_note.htm#fn741"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> The woman said to Saul, "Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!" 
<bqverse 13>13  The king said to her, "Don't be afraid. What have you seen?" The woman replied to Saul, "I have seen one like a god<a name="fnB742" href="1sa_note.htm#fn742"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> coming up from the ground!" 
<bqverse 14>14  He said to her, "What about his appearance?" She said, "An old man is coming up! He is wrapped in a robe!"<p>
Then Saul realized it was Samuel, and he bowed his face toward the ground and kneeled down. 
<bqverse 15>15  Samuel said to Saul, "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?" Saul replied, "I am very concerned. The Philistines are fighting against me and God has turned away from me. He does not answer me--not by the prophets nor by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what I should do."<p>

<bqverse 16>16  Samuel said, "Why are you asking me, now that the LORD has turned away from you and has become your enemy? 
<bqverse 17>17  The LORD has done exactly as I prophesied.<a name="fnB743" href="1sa_note.htm#fn743"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> The LORD has torn the kingdom from your hand and has given it to your neighbor David. 
<bqverse 18>18  Since you did not obey the LORD<a name="fnB744" href="1sa_note.htm#fn744"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and did not carry out his fierce anger against the Amalekites, the LORD has done this thing to you today. 
<bqverse 19>19  The LORD will hand you and Israel over to the Philistines.<a name="fnB745" href="1sa_note.htm#fn745"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> Tomorrow both you and your sons will be with me.<a name="fnB746" href="1sa_note.htm#fn746"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> The LORD will also hand the army<a name="fnB747" href="1sa_note.htm#fn747"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> of Israel over to the Philistines."<p>

<bqverse 20>20  Saul quickly fell full length on the ground and was very afraid because of Samuel's words. He was completely drained of energy,<a name="fnB748" href="1sa_note.htm#fn748"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> not having eaten anything<a name="fnB749" href="1sa_note.htm#fn749"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> all that day and night. 
<bqverse 21>21  When the woman came to Saul and saw how terrified he was, she said to him, "Your servant has done what you asked.<a name="fnB750" href="1sa_note.htm#fn750"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> I took my life into my own hands and did what you told me.<a name="fnB751" href="1sa_note.htm#fn751"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  Now it's your turn to listen to your servant. Let me set before you a bit of bread so that you can eat. When you regain your strength, you can go on your way."<p>

<bqverse 23>23  But he refused, saying, "I won't eat." Both his servants and the woman urged<a name="fnB752" href="1sa_note.htm#fn752"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> him to eat so he gave in.<a name="fnB753" href="1sa_note.htm#fn753"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> He got up from the ground and sat down on the bed. 
<bqverse 24>24  Now the woman<a name="fnB754" href="1sa_note.htm#fn754"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> had a well-fed calf<a name="fnB755" href="1sa_note.htm#fn755"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> at her home that she quickly slaughtered. Taking some flour, she kneaded bread and baked it without leaven. 
<bqverse 25>25  She brought it to Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they arose and left that same night.

<p><i>David is Rejected by the Philistine Leaders</i>
<p><A NAME="29"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> The Philistines assembled all their troops<a name="fnB756" href="1sa_note.htm#fn756"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> at Aphek, while Israel camped at the spring that is in Jezreel. 
<bqverse 2>2  When the leaders of the Philistines were passing in review at the head of their units of hundreds and thousands,<a name="fnB757" href="1sa_note.htm#fn757"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> David and his men were passing in review in the rear with Achish.<p>

<bqverse 3>3  The leaders of the Philistines asked, "What about these Hebrews?" Achish said to the leaders of the Philistines, "Isn't this David, the servant of King Saul of Israel, who has been with me for quite some time?<a name="fnB758" href="1sa_note.htm#fn758"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> I have found no fault with him from the day of his defection until the present time."<a name="fnB759" href="1sa_note.htm#fn759"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 4>4  But the leaders of the Philistines became angry with him and said<a name="fnB760" href="1sa_note.htm#fn760"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> to him, "Send the man back! Let him return to the place that you assigned him. Don't let him go down with us into the battle, for he might become<a name="fnB761" href="1sa_note.htm#fn761"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> our adversary in the battle. What better way to please his lord than with the heads of these men?<a name="fnB762" href="1sa_note.htm#fn762"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  Isn't this David, of whom they sang as they danced,<a name="fnB763" href="1sa_note.htm#fn763"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a></p>
<br>`Saul has struck down his thousands,<br>
but David his tens of thousands'?"</ul><p>
<bqverse 6>6  So Achish summoned David and said to him, "As surely as the LORD lives, you are an honest man, and I am glad to have you<a name="fnB764" href="1sa_note.htm#fn764"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> serving<a name="fnB765" href="1sa_note.htm#fn765"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> with me in the army.<a name="fnB766" href="1sa_note.htm#fn766"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> I have found no fault with you from the day that you first came to me until the present time. But in the opinion<a name="fnB767" href="1sa_note.htm#fn767"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> of the leaders, you are not reliable.<a name="fnB768" href="1sa_note.htm#fn768"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  So turn and leave<a name="fnB769" href="1sa_note.htm#fn769"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> in peace. You must not do anything that the leaders of the Philistines consider improper."<a name="fnB770" href="1sa_note.htm#fn770"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 8>8  But David said to Achish, "What have I done? What have you found in your servant from the day that I first came into your presence until the present time, that I shouldn't go and fight the enemies of my lord the king?" 
<bqverse 9>9  Achish replied to David, "I am convinced that you are as reliable<a name="fnB771" href="1sa_note.htm#fn771"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> as the angel of God. However, the leaders of the Philistines have said, `He must not go up with us in the battle.' 
<bqverse 10>10  So get up early in the morning along with the servants of your lord who have come with you.<a name="fnB772" href="1sa_note.htm#fn772"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> When you get up early in the morning, as soon as it is light enough to see, leave."<a name="fnB773" href="1sa_note.htm#fn773"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 11>11  So David and his men got up early in the morning to return<a name="fnB774" href="1sa_note.htm#fn774"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> to the land of the Philistines, but the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
<bqchapter 30>
<a name="_Toc494011913"></a></p>
<p><i>David Defeats the Amalekites</i>
<p><A NAME="30"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> On the third day David and his men came to Ziklag. Now the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They attacked Ziklag and burned it.<a name="fnB775" href="1sa_note.htm#fn775"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  They took captive the women who were in it, from the youngest to the oldest, but they did not kill anyone. They simply carried them off and went on their way. <p>

<bqverse 3>3  When David and his men came to the city, they found it burned.<a name="fnB776" href="1sa_note.htm#fn776"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> Their wives, sons, and daughters had been taken captive. 
<bqverse 4>4  Then David and the men<a name="fnB777" href="1sa_note.htm#fn777"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> who were with him wept loudly<a name="fnB778" href="1sa_note.htm#fn778"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> until they could weep no more.<a name="fnB779" href="1sa_note.htm#fn779"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  David's two wives had been taken captive--Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail the Carmelite, Nabal's widow. 
<bqverse 6>6  David was very upset, for the men<a name="fnB780" href="1sa_note.htm#fn780"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> were thinking of stoning him;<a name="fnB781" href="1sa_note.htm#fn781"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> each man grieved<a name="fnB782" href="1sa_note.htm#fn782"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> over his sons and daughters. But David drew strength from the LORD his God.<p>

<bqverse 7>7  Then David said to the priest Abiathar son of Ahimelech, "Bring me the ephod." So Abiathar brought the ephod to David. 
<bqverse 8>8  David inquired of the LORD, saying, "Should I pursue this raiding band? Will I overtake them?" He said to him, "Pursue, for you will certainly overtake them and carry out a rescue."<p>

<bqverse 9>9  So David went, accompanied by six hundred men. When he came to the Wadi Besor, those who were in the rear stayed there.<a name="fnB783" href="1sa_note.htm#fn783"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  David and four hundred men continued the pursuit, but two hundred men who were too exhausted to cross the Wadi Besor stayed there. <p>

<bqverse 11>11  Then they found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David. They gave him bread to eat and water to drink. 
<bqverse 12>12  They gave him a slice of pressed figs and two bunches of raisins to eat. This greatly refreshed him,<a name="fnB784" href="1sa_note.htm#fn784"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> for he had not eaten food or drunk water for three days and three nights. 
<bqverse 13>13  David said to him, "To whom do you belong, and where are you from?" The young man said, "I am an Egyptian, the servant of an Amalekite man. My master abandoned me when I was ill for three days. 
<bqverse 14>14  We conducted a raid on the Negev of the Kerethites, on the area of Judah, and on the Negev of Caleb. We burned Ziklag."<a name="fnB785" href="1sa_note.htm#fn785"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  David said to him, "Can you take us down to this raiding party?" He said, "Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master, and I will take you down to this raiding party."<p>

<bqverse 16>16  So he took David<a name="fnB786" href="1sa_note.htm#fn786"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> down, and they found them spread out over the land. They were eating and drinking and enjoying themselves because of all the loot<a name="fnB787" href="1sa_note.htm#fn787"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah. 
<bqverse 17>17  But David struck them down from twilight until the following evening. None of them escaped, with the exception of four hundred young men who got away on camels.<a name="fnB788" href="1sa_note.htm#fn788"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  David retrieved everything the Amalekites had taken; he<a name="fnB789" href="1sa_note.htm#fn789"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> also rescued his two wives. 
<bqverse 19>19  There was nothing missing, whether small or great. He retrieved sons and daughters, the loot, and everything else they had taken.<a name="fnB790" href="1sa_note.htm#fn790"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> David brought everything back. 
<bqverse 20>20  David took all the flocks and herds and drove them in front of the rest of the animals. People were saying, "This is David's loot!"<p>

<bqverse 21>21  Then David approached the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to go with him,<a name="fnB791" href="1sa_note.htm#fn791"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> those whom they had left at the Wadi Besor. They went out to meet David and the people who were with him. When David approached the people, he asked how they were doing. 
<bqverse 22>22  But all the evil and worthless men among those who had gone with David said, "Since they didn't go with us,<a name="fnB792" href="1sa_note.htm#fn792"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> we won't give them any of the loot we retrieved. They may take only their wives and children. Let them lead them away and be gone!" <p>

<bqverse 23>23  But David said, "No! You shouldn't do this, my brothers. Look at what the LORD has given us!<a name="fnB793" href="1sa_note.htm#fn793"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> He has protected us and has delivered into our hands the raiding party that came against us. 
<bqverse 24>24 Who will listen to you in this matter? The portion of the one who went down into the battle will be the same as the portion of the one who remained with the equipment. Let their portions be the same." <p>

<bqverse 25>25  From that time onward it was a binding ordinance<a name="fnB794" href="1sa_note.htm#fn794"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> for Israel, right up to the present time. <p>

<bqverse 26>26  When David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the loot to the elders of Judah who were his friends, saying, "Here's a gift<a name="fnB795" href="1sa_note.htm#fn795"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> for you from the loot of the LORD's enemies." 
<bqverse 27>27  The gift was for those in the following locations:<a name="fnB796" href="1sa_note.htm#fn796"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> for those in Bethel, Ramoth Negev, and Jattir; 
<bqverse 28>28  for those in Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa, 
<bqverse 29>29  and Racal; for those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites and Kenites; 
<bqverse 30>30  for those in Hormah, Bor Ashan, Athach, 
<bqverse 31>31  and Hebron; and for those in whatever other places David and his men had traveled.

<p><i>The Death of Saul</i>
<p><A NAME="31"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel. The men of Israel fled from the Philistines and many of them fell dead on Mount Gilboa. 
<bqverse 2>2  The Philistines stayed right on the heels<a name="fnB797" href="1sa_note.htm#fn797"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> of Saul and his sons. They<a name="fnB798" href="1sa_note.htm#fn798"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> struck down Saul's sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malki-Shua. 
<bqverse 3>3  Saul himself was in the thick of the battle;<a name="fnB799" href="1sa_note.htm#fn799"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> the archers<a name="fnB800" href="1sa_note.htm#fn800"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> spotted him and severely wounded him.<p>

<bqverse 4>4  Saul said to his armor bearer, "Draw your sword and stab me with it. Otherwise these uncircumcised people will come, stab me, and torture me." But his armor bearer refused to do it, because he was very afraid. So Saul took the sword and fell on it. 
<bqverse 5>5  When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his own sword and died with him. 
<bqverse 6>6  So Saul, his three sons, his armor bearer, and all his men died together that day. <p>

<bqverse 7>7  When the men of Israel who were in the valley and across the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the cities and fled. The Philistines came and occupied them. <p>

<bqverse 8>8  The next day, when the Philistines came to strip loot from the corpses, they discovered Saul and his three sons lying dead<a name="fnB801" href="1sa_note.htm#fn801"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> on Mount Gilboa. 
<bqverse 9>9  They cut off Saul's<a name="fnB802" href="1sa_note.htm#fn802"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> head and stripped him of his armor. They sent messengers to announce the news in the temple of their idols and among their people throughout the surrounding land of the Philistines. 
<bqverse 10>10  They placed his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths<a name="fnB803" href="1sa_note.htm#fn803"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> and hung his corpse on the city wall of Beth Shan.<p>

<bqverse 11>11  When the residents of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, 
<bqverse 12>12 all the warriors set out and traveled all night. They took Saul's corpse and the corpses of his sons from the city wall of Beth Shan and went<a name="fnB804" href="1sa_note.htm#fn804"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> to Jabesh, where they burned them. 
<bqverse 13>13  They took the bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh; then they fasted for seven days.</p>
