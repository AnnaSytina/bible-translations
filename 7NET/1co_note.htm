However, not only is a genitive of association not required by the syntax (cf. D. B.

 <a name="fn44" href="1co.htm#fnB44"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:12)  The various materials described here, both valuable (<i>gold, silver, precious stones</i>) and worthless (<i>wood, hay, or straw</i>) refer to the quality of work built on the <i>foundation</i>, or possibly to the motivation of those doing the building. The materials themselves have been understood as deeds or as people (since ultimately the passage is addressing those who minister to others).<br>
 <a name="fn45" href="1co.htm#fnB45"><sup>10</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:13)  <i>The Day</i> refers to the Day of the Lord Jesus Christ (cf. 1:8; 5:5) when each Christian worker will appear before Christ for evaluation of his ministry.

 <b>sn</b> (3:13)  It is unclear whether the phrase <i>it will be revealed by fire</i> describes the Day (subject of the previous clause) or each one's work (subject of the clause before that).<br>
 <a name="fn47" href="1co.htm#fnB47"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:15)  The translation "will be punished" is given here by BAGD 338 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">zhmiovw</FONT> 2. But the next clause says "he will be delivered" and so "suffering loss" is more likely to refer to the destruction of the "work" by fire or the loss of the reward that could have been gained.<br>
 <a name="fn48" href="1co.htm#fnB48"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:16)  <i>You are God's temple</i> refers here to the church, since the pronoun <i>you</i> is plural in the Greek text. (In 6:19 the same imagery is used in a different context to refer to the individual believer.)<br>

 <b>sn</b> (4:21)  Paul is using the term <i>rod</i> in this context to refer to his apostolic authority to discipline those who have become arrogant in the Corinthian church and have attempted to undermine his ministry (cf. 4:18-19).<br>
 <a name="fn58" href="1co.htm#fnB58"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:1)  Or "someone has married"; <i>Grk </i>"someone has," but the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">e[cw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ecw</FONT>) is routinely used of marital relationships (cf. BAGD 332 s.v. 2.b.<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">a</FONT>), including sexual relationships. The exact nature of the relationship is uncertain in this case; it is not clear, for example, whether the man had actually married the woman or was merely cohabiting with her.<br>

 <a name="fn62" href="1co.htm#fnB62"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:3)  Verse 3 is one sentence in Greek ("For--even though I am absent in body, yet present in spirit--I have already judged the one who did this, as though I were present") that has been broken up due to English stylistic considerations.<br>
 <a name="fn63" href="1co.htm#fnB63"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:4)  Verses 4b-5a are capable of various punctuations: (a) "and I am with you in spirit, through the power of our Lord Jesus turn this man over to Satan"; (b) "and I am with you in spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus, turn this man over to Satan"; (c) "and I am with you in spirit, along with the power of our Lord Jesus, turn this man over to Satan" (as adopted in the text). The first option suggests the Lord's power is needed when the church is to hand the man over to Satan; the second option suggests that the Lord's power is present when Paul is gathered with the Corinthians in spirit; the third option leaves the relation of the Lord's power to the surrounding phrases vague, perhaps implying that both are in view.<br>
 <a name="fn64" href="1co.htm#fnB64"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:5)  Or perhaps "turn this man over to Satan for the destruction of your fleshly works, so that your spirit may be saved..."; <i>Grk </i>"for the destruction of the flesh, so that the spirit may be saved." This is one of the most difficult passages in the NT, and there are many different interpretations regarding what is in view here. (1) Many interpreters see some sort of excommunication in view here ("turn this man over to Satan") which in turn leads to the man's physical death ("the destruction of the flesh"), resulting in the man's ultimate salvation ("that [his] spirit may be saved..."). (2) Others see the phrase "destruction of the flesh" as referring to extreme physical suffering or illness that stops short of physical death, thus leading the offender to repentance and salvation. (3) A number of scholars (e.g. G. D. Fee, <i>First Corinthians</i> [NICNT], 212-13) take the reference to the "flesh" to refer to the offender's "sinful nature" or "carnal nature," which is "destroyed" by placing him outside the church, back in Satan's domain (exactly how this "destruction" is accomplished is not clear, and is one of the problems with this view). (4) More recently some have argued that neither the "flesh" nor the "spirit" belong to the offender, but to the church collectively; thus it is the "fleshly works" of the congregation which are being destroyed by the removal of the offender (cf. 5:13) so that the "spirit," the corporate life of the church lived in union with God through the Holy Spirit, may be preserved (cf. 5:7-8). See, e.g., B. Campbell, "Flesh and Spirit in 1 Cor 5:5: An Exercise in Rhetorical Criticism of the NT," <i>JETS</i> 36 (1993): 331-42). The alternate translation "for the destruction of your fleshly works, so that your spirit may be saved" reflects this latter view.<br>

 <a name="fn66" href="1co.htm#fnB66"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:6)  In this passage (5:6-8) <i>yeast</i> represents the presence of evil within the church, specifically the immoral person described in 5:1-5 and mentioned again in 5:13.<br>

 <a name="fn69" href="1co.htm#fnB69"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:11)  <i>Grk</i> "a brother," but the Greek word "brother" may be used for "brother or sister," "fellow Christian," or "fellow member of the church." Here the term "brother" broadly connotes familial relationships within the family of God (cf. BAGD 16 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajdelfov" </FONT>1, 2).<br>
 <a name="fn70" href="1co.htm#fnB70"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:11)  Or "a reviler"; BAGD 479 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">loivdoro"</FONT> defines the term as "reviler, abusive person."<br>

This verb comes, however, at the end of the sentence. It is not impossible that Paul meant for it to be understood this way, but its placement in the sentence does not make this probable.<br>

 <a name="fn76" href="1co.htm#fnB76"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:9)  This term is sometimes rendered "effeminate," although in contemporary English usage such a translation could be taken to refer to demeanor rather than behavior.

L&amp;N 88.281 states, "the passive male partner in homosexual intercourse--`homosexual.' ...As in Greek, a number of other languages also have entirely distinct terms for the active and passive roles in homosexual intercourse." See also the discussion in G. D. Fee, <i>First Corinthians</i> (NICNT), 243-44. A number of modern translations have adopted the phrase "male prostitutes" for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">malakoiv</FONT> in 1 Cor 6:9 (NIV, NRSV, NLT) but this could be misunderstood by the modern reader to mean "males who sell their services to women," while the term in question appears, at least in context, to relate to homosexual activity between males. Furthermore, it is far from certain that prostitution as commonly understood (the selling of sexual favors) is specified here, as opposed to a consensual relationship. Thus the translation "passive homosexual partners" has been used here.<br>
 <a name="fn77" href="1co.htm#fnB77"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:9)  On this term BAGD 109 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajrsenokoivth"</FONT> states, "<i>a male who practices homosexuality, pederast, sodomite</i> 1 Cor 6:9; 1 Ti 1:10; Pol 5:3.

Since there is a distinction in contemporary usage between sexual orientation and actual behavior, the qualification "practicing" was supplied in the translation, following the emphasis in BAGD.<br>

 <a name="fn94" href="1co.htm#fnB94"><sup>8</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:15)  Interpreters differ over the implication of the statement <i>the brother or sister is not bound</i>. One view is that the believer is "not bound to continue the marriage," i.e., not so slavishly tied to the instruction about not divorcing (cf. vv. 10-11) that he or she refuses to face reality when the unbelieving spouse is unwilling to continue the relationship. In this view divorce is allowable under these circumstances, but not remarriage (v. 11 still applies: remain unmarried or be reconciled). The other view is that the believer is "not bound in regard to marriage," i.e., free to remain single or to remarry. The argument for this view is the conceptual parallel with vv. 39-40, where a wife is said to be "bound" (a different word in Greek, but the same concept) as long as her husband lives. But if the husband dies, she is "free" to marry as she wishes, only in the Lord. If the parallel holds, then <i>not bound</i> in v. 15 also means "free to marry another."<br>

 <a name="fn109" href="1co.htm#fnB109"><sup>23</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:38)  <i>1&#160;Cor&#160;7:36-38. </i>There are two common approaches to understanding the situation addressed in these verses. One view involves a father or male guardian deciding whether to give his daughter or female ward in marriage (cf. NASB, NIV margin). The evidence for this view is: (1) the phrase in v. 37 (<i>Grk</i>) "to keep his own virgin" fits this view well ("keep his own virgin [in his household]" rather than give her in marriage), but it does not fit the second view (there is little warrant for adding "her" in the way the second view translates it: "to keep <i>her</i> as a virgin"). (2) The verb used twice in v. 38 (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">gamivzw</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">gamizw</FONT>) normally means "to give in marriage" not "to get married." The latter is usually expressed by <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">gamevw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">gamew</FONT>), as in v. 36b. (3) The father deciding what is best regarding his daughter's marriage reflects the more likely cultural situation in ancient Corinth, though it does not fit modern Western customs. While Paul gives his advice in such a situation, he does not command that marriages be arranged in this way universally. If this view is taken, the translation will read as follows: "<b>7:36</b> If anyone thinks he is acting inappropriately toward his unmarried daughter, if she is past the bloom of youth and it seems necessary, he should do what he wishes; he does not sin. Let them marry. <b>7:37</b> But the man who is firm in his commitment, and is under no necessity but has control over his will, and has decided in his own mind to keep his daughter unmarried, does well. <b>7:38</b> So then the one who gives his daughter in marriage does well, but the one who does not give her does better." The other view is taken by NRSV, NIV text, NJB, REB: a single man deciding whether to marry the woman to whom he is engaged. The evidence for this view is: (1) it seems odd to use the word "virgin" (vv. 36, 37, 38) if "daughter" or "ward" is intended. (2) The other view requires some difficult shifting of subjects in v. 36, whereas this view manages a more consistent subject for the various verbs used. (3) The phrases in these verses are used consistently elsewhere in this chapter to describe considerations appropriate to the engaged couple themselves (cf. vv. 9, 28, 39). It seems odd not to change the phrasing in speaking about a father or guardian. If this second view is taken, the translation will read as follows: "<b>7:36</b> If anyone thinks he is acting inappropriately toward his fianc&eacute;e, if his passions are too strong and it seems necessary, he should do what he wishes; he does not sin. Let them marry. <b>7:37</b> But the man who is firm in his commitment, and is under no necessity but has control over his will, and has decided in his own mind to keep her as his fianc&eacute;e, does well. <b>7:38</b> So then, the one who marries his fianc&eacute;e does well, but the one who does not marry her does better."<br>

The passive is obviously a motivated reading in that it is clearer and conforms to typical Pauline usage (his thirteen instances of the verb are all either active or passive). B. M. Metzger, in representing a minority opinion of the UBS Committee, suggests that the middle would have been appropriate for Jewish baptism in which the convert baptizes himself (<i>Textual Commentary</i>, 493). But this assumes that the middle is a <i>direct</i> middle, a rare occurrence in the NT (and never elsewhere with this verb). Further, it is not really baptism that is in view in v. 2, but passing through the Red Sea (thus, a metaphorical use). It is better to take the middle as causative/permissive and the scribes as changing it to a passive for clarity's sake. Translational differences are minimal, though some exegetical implications are involved. <br>

A handful of MSS (A 81 <i>et pauci</i>) have <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeovn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">qeon</FONT>,<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl"> </FONT>"God"). The <i>nomina sacra </i>for these readings are quite similar (<FONT FACE="GREEK UNCIALS">kMn</FONT>,<FONT FACE="GREEK UNCIALS"> cMn</FONT>, and <FONT FACE="GREEK UNCIALS">qMn </FONT>respectively), so one could account for the different readings by way of confusion. On closer examination, the variants appear to be intentional changes. Alexandrian scribes replaced the highly specific term, "Christ," with the less specific terms, "Lord" and "God," because in the context it seems to be anachronistic to speak of the exodus generation putting <i>Christ</i> to the test. If the original had been "Lord," it seems unlikely that a scribe would have willingly created a difficulty by substituting the more specific "Christ." Moreover, even if not motivated by a tendency to overcorrect, a scribe might be likely to assimilate the word "Christ" to "Lord" in conformity with Deut 6:16 or other passages. The evidence from the early church regarding the reading of this verse is rather compelling in favor of "Christ." Marcion, a second-century, anti-Jewish heretic, would naturally have opposed any reference to Christ in historical involvement with Israel, because he thought of the Creator God of the OT as inherently evil. In spite of this strong prejudice, though, Marcion read a text with "Christ." Other early church writers attest to the presence of the word "Christ," including Clement of Alexandria and Origen. What is more, the synod of Antioch in A.D. 268 used the reading "Christ" as evidence of the preexistence of Christ when it condemned Paul of Samosata (see G. Zuntz, <i>The Text of the Epistles</i>, 126-27; B. M. Metzger, <i>Textual Commentary</i>, 494; C. D. Osburn, "The Text of 1 Corinthians 10:9," <i>New Testament Textual Criticism: Its Significance for Exegesis</i>, 201-11; <i>contra </i>A. Robertson and A. Plummer, <i>First Corinthians</i> [ICC], 205-206). Since "Christ" is the more difficult reading on all accounts, it is almost certainly original. In addition, "Christ" is consistent with Paul's style in this passage (cf. 10:4, a text in which Marcion also reads "Christ"). This text is also christologically significant, since the reading "Christ" makes an explicit claim to the preexistence of Christ. (The textual critic faces a similar dilemma in Jude 5. In a similar exodus context, the more important Alexandrian MSS [A B 33 81 2344 <i>et pauci</i>] and the Vulgate read "Jesus" in place of "Lord." Two of those MSS [A 81] are the same MSS that replace "Christ" with "God" in 1 Cor 10:9. See the textual notes on Jude 5 for more information.) In sum, "Christ" has all the earmarks of authenticity here and should be considered original.<br>

The competing reading, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kauqhvsomai</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kauqhsomai</FONT>, "I will burn"), is found in C D F G L 81 1175 1881* latt <i>et alii</i> and a host of patristic writers. From this reading other variants were obviously derived: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kauqhvswmai</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kauqhswmai</FONT>), an impossible future subjunctive ("I might burn") read by the Byzantine text and a few others; and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kauqh'/</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kauqh</FONT>, "it might be burned") read by 1505 <i>et pauci</i>. On an external level, the Alexandrian reading is obviously superior, though the Western and Byzantine readings need to be accounted for. (The following is derived largely from B. M. Metzger, <i>Textual Commentary</i>, loc. cit.). Internally, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kauchvswmai</FONT> is superior for the following reasons: (1) Once the Church started suffering persecution and martyrdom by fire, the <i>v.l.</i> naturally arose. Once there, it is difficult to see why any scribe would intentionally change it to <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kauchvswmai</FONT>. (2) Involving as it does the change of just two letters (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">c</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">q</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">c</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">q</FONT>], <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">w</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">w</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">o</FONT>]), this reading could be accomplished without much fanfare. Yet, it appears cumbersome in the context, both because of the passive voice and especially the retention of the first person ("If I give up my body that I may be burned"). A more logical word would have been the third person passive, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kauqh'/</FONT>, as read in 1505 ("If I give up my body that it may be burned"). (3) Although the connection between giving up one's body and boasting is ambiguous, this very ambiguity has all the earmarks of being from Paul. It may have the force of giving up one's body into slavery. In any event, it looks to be the harder reading. Incidentally, the Byzantine reading, as indicated earlier, is quite impossible. Here's why: the future subjunctive did not occur in Koine Greek. As the reading of the majority of Byzantine minuscules, its roots are clearly post-Koine and as such is a "grammatical monstrosity that cannot be attributed to Paul" (B. M. Metzger, <i>Textual Commentary</i>, 498). Cf. also the notes in BDF &#167;28; MHT 2:219. This is clear evidence of the late roots of the Byzantine text.<br>

Corinth was well known in the ancient world for producing some of the finest bronze mirrors available. Paul's point in this analogy, then, is not that our current understanding and relationship with God is distorted (as if the mirror reflected poorly), but rather that it is "indirect," (i.e., the nature of looking in a mirror) compared to the relationship we will enjoy with him in the future when we see him "face to face" (cf. G. D. Fee, <i>First Corinthians</i> [NICNT], 648). The word "indirectly" translates the Greek phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn aijnivgmati </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ejn ainigmati</FONT>, "in an obscure image") which itself may reflect an allusion to Num 12:8 (LXX <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ouj di= aijnigmavtwn</FONT>), where God says that he speaks to Moses "mouth to mouth [= face to face]...and not in dark figures [of speech]." Though this allusion to the OT is not explicitly developed here, it probably did not go unnoticed by the Corinthians who were apparently familiar with OT traditions about Moses (cf. 1 Cor 10:2). Indeed, in 2 Cor 3:13-18 Paul had recourse with the Corinthians to contrast Moses' ministry under the old covenant with the hope afforded through apostolic ministry and the new covenant. Further, it is in this context, specifically in 2 Cor 3:18, that the apostle invokes the use of the mirror analogy again in order to unfold the nature of the Christian's progressive transformation by the Spirit.<br>

Because of the reference to husbands in v. 35, the word may be translated "wives" here.

Therefore (1) some take <i>be silent</i> to mean not taking an authoritative teaching role as 1 Tim 2 indicates, but (2) the better suggestion is to relate it to the preceding regulations about evaluating the prophets (v. 29). Here Paul would be indicating that the women should not speak up during such an evaluation, since such questioning would be in violation of the submission to male leadership that the OT calls for (<i>the law</i>, e.g., Gen 2:18).<br>
 <a name="fn178" href="1co.htm#fnB178"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tc</b> (14:35)  Some scholars have argued that vv. 34-35 should be excised from the text (principally Straatman, Fee, Payne). This is because the Western witnesses have these verses after v. 40, while the rest of the tradition retains them here. There are no MSS that omit the verses. Why, then, would some scholars wish to excise the verses? Because they believe that this best explains how they could end up in two different locations, that is to say, that the verses got into the text by way of a very early gloss added in the margin. Most scribes put the gloss after v. 33; others, not knowing where they should go, put them at the end of the chapter. G. D. Fee points out that "Those who wish to maintain the authenticity of these verses must at least offer an <i>adequate</i> answer as to how this arrangement came into existence if Paul wrote them originally as our vv. 34-35" (<i>First Corinthians</i> [NICNT], 700). In a footnote he adds, "The point is that <i>if it were already in the text after v. 33, </i>there is no <i>reason</i> for a copyist to make such a radical transposition." Although it is not our intention to interact with proponents of the shorter text in any detail here, a couple of points ought to be made. (1) Since these verses occur in <i>all witnesses to 1 Corinthians</i>, to argue that they are not original means that they must have crept into the text at the earliest stage of transmission. How early? Earlier than when the <i>pericope adulterae</i> (John 7:53-8:11) made its way into the text (late 2nd, early 3rd century?), earlier than the longer ending of Mark (16:9-20) was produced (early 2nd century?), and earlier than even "in Ephesus" was added to Eph 1:1 (upon reception of the letter by the first church to which it came, the church at Ephesus [c. A.D. 60])--because in these other, similar places, the earliest witnesses do not <i>add</i> the words. This text thus stands as remarkable, unique. Indeed, since all the witnesses have the words, the evidence points to them as having been inserted into the <i>original</i> document. Who would have done such a thing? And, further, why would scribes have regarded it as original since it was obviously added in the margin? This leads to our second point. (2) Following a suggestion made by E. E. Ellis ("The Silenced Wives of Corinth (I Cor. 14:34-5)," <i>New Testament Textual Criticism: Its Significance for Exegesis</i>, 213-20 [the suggestion comes at the end of the article, almost as an afterthought]), it is likely that Paul himself added the words in the margin. Since it was so much material to add, Paul could have squelched any suspicions by indicating that the words were his (e.g., by adding his name or some other means [cf. 2 Thess 3:17]). This way no scribe would think that the material was inauthentic. (Incidentally, this is unlike the textual problem at Rom 5:1, for there only one letter was at stake; hence, scribes would easily have thought that the "text" reading was original. And Paul would hardly be expected to add his signature for one letter.) (3) What then is to account for the uniform Western tradition of having the verses at the end of the chapter? Our conjecture (and that is all it is) is that the scribe of the Western <i>Vorlage</i> could no longer read where the verses were to be added (any marginal arrows or other directional device could have been smudged), but, recognizing that this was part of the original text, felt compelled to put it somewhere. The least offensive place would have been at the end of the material on church conduct (end of chapter 14), before the instructions about the resurrection began. Although there were no chapter divisions in the earliest period of copying, scribes could still detect thought breaks (note the usage in the earliest papyri). (4) The very location of the verses in the Western tradition argues strongly that Paul both authored vv. 34-35 and that they were originally part of the margin of the text. Otherwise, one has a difficulty explaining why no scribe seemed to have hinted that these verses might be inauthentic (the scribal sigla of codex B, as noticed by Payne, can be interpreted otherwise than as an indication of inauthenticity). There are apparently no MSS that have an asterisk or obelisk in the margin. Yet in other places in the NT where scribes doubted the authenticity of the clauses before them, they often noted their protest with an asterisk or obelisk. We are thus compelled to regard the words as original, and as belonging where they are in the text above. <br>

If the original reading is the future tense, then "we will bear" would be a guarantee that believers would be like Jesus (and unlike Adam) in the resurrection. If the aorist subjunctive is original, then "let us bear" would be a command to show forth the image of Jesus, i.e., to live as citizens of the kingdom believers will one day inherit. The future indicative is not widespread geographically. At the same time, it fits the context well: not only are there indicatives in this section (especially vv. 42-49), but the conjunction <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>) introducing the comparative <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaqwv"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kaqws</FONT>) seems best to connect to the preceding by furthering the same argument (what is, not what ought to be). For this reason, though, the future indicative could be a reading thus motivated by an early scribe. In light of the extremely weighty evidence for the aorist subjunctive, it is probably best to regard the aorist subjunctive as original. This connects well with v. 50, for there Paul makes a pronouncement that seems to presuppose some sort of exhortation. G. D. Fee (<i>First Corinthians</i> [NICNT], 795) argues for the originality of the subjunctive, stating that "it is nearly impossible to account for anyone's having changed a clearly understandable future to the hortatory subjunctive so early and so often that it made its way into every textual history as the predominant reading." The subjunctive makes a great deal of sense in view of the occasion of 1 Cor. Paul wrote to combat an over-realized eschatology in which some of the Corinthians evidently believed they were experiencing all the benefits of the resurrection body in the present, and thus that their behavior did not matter. If the subjunctive is the correct reading, it seems Paul makes two points: (1) that the resurrection is a bodily one, as distinct from an out-of-body experience, and (2) that one's behavior in the interim does make a difference (see 15:32-34, 58).<br>

 <a name="fn227" href="1co.htm#fnB227"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (16:19)  On <i>Aquila and Prisca</i> see also Acts 18:2, 18, 26; Rom 16:3-4; 2 Tim 4:19. In the NT "Priscilla" and "Prisca" are the same person. The author of Acts uses the full name Priscilla, while Paul uses the diminutive form <i>Prisca</i>.<br>
 <a name="fn228" href="1co.htm#fnB228"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tc</b> (16:19)  The plural form of the verb, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajspavzontai</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">aspazontai</FONT>), is found in several good MSS (B F G 075 0121 0243 33 1739 1881) as well as the Byzantine cursives. But the singular is read by an equally impressive group (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> C D K P <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Y</FONT> 104 2464 <i>et alii</i>). This part of the verse is lacking in codex A. Deciding on the basis of external evidence is quite difficult. Internally, however, the singular appears to have given rise to the plural: (1) the rest of the greetings in this verse are in the plural; this one was probably made plural by some scribes for purposes of assimilation; and, more significantly, (2) since both Aquila and Prisca are mentioned as the ones who send the greeting, the plural is more natural. The singular is, of course, not impossible Greek; indeed, a singular verb with a compound subject is used with some frequency in the NT (cf. Matt 13:55; Mark 8:27; 14:1; John 2:2; 3:22; 4:36, 53; Acts 5:29; 16:31; 1 Tim 6:4). This is especially common when "Jesus and his disciples" is the subject. What is significant is that when such a construction is found the emphasis is placed on the first-named person (in this case, Aquila). Normally when these two are mentioned in the NT, Priscilla is mentioned first (Acts 18:18, 26; Rom 16:3; 2 Tim 4:19). Only here and in Acts 18:2 (the first mention of them) is Aquila mentioned before Priscilla. Many suggest that Priscilla is listed first due to prominence. Though that is possible, both the mention of Aquila first here and the singular verb give him special prominence. What such prominence means in each instance is difficult to assess. Nevertheless, here is a Pauline instance in which Aquila is given prominence. Too much can be made of the word order argument in either direction.<br>
