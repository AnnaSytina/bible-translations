<a name="_Toc494013033"></a><p><i>Introduction</i>
<p><A NAME="1"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> In the eighth month of Darius's<a name="fnB0" href="zec_note.htm#fn0"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> second year,<a name="fnB1" href="zec_note.htm#fn1"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah,<a name="fnB2" href="zec_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> son of Berechiah son of Iddo, as follows: <p>

<bqverse 2>2  "The LORD was very angry with your ancestors.<a name="fnB3" href="zec_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  Therefore say to the people,<a name="fnB4" href="zec_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> `The sovereign LORD<a name="fnB5" href="zec_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> says, "Turn<a name="fnB6" href="zec_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> to me, and I will turn to you." 
<bqverse 4>4  Do not be like your ancestors, to whom the former prophets called out, saying, `The sovereign LORD says, "Turn now from your evil wickedness," but they would by no means obey me,' says the LORD. 
<bqverse 5>5  As for your ancestors, where are they? And did the prophets live forever? 
<bqverse 6>6  But have my words and statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, not outlived your fathers?"<a name="fnB7" href="zec_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> Then they paid attention<a name="fnB8" href="zec_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> and confessed, "The sovereign LORD has indeed done what he said he would do to us, because of our sinful ways."<a name="_Toc494013034"></a></p>
<p><i>The Introduction to the Visions</i>
<p>
<bqverse 7>7  On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month <i>Shebat</i>, in Darius's second year,<a name="fnB9" href="zec_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah son of Iddo, as follows:<a name="_Toc494013035"></a></p>
<p><i>The Content of the First Vision</i>
<p>
<bqverse 8>8 I was attentive that night and saw a man seated<a name="fnB10" href="zec_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> on a red horse that stood among some myrtle trees<a name="fnB11" href="zec_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> in the ravine. Behind him were red, sorrel,<a name="fnB12" href="zec_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> and white horses.<a name="_Toc494013036"></a></p>
<p><i>The Interpretation of the First Vision</i>
<p>
<bqverse 9>9 Then I asked one nearby, "What are these, sir?" The angelic messenger<a name="fnB13" href="zec_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> who replied to me said, "I will show you what these are." 
<bqverse 10>10  Then the man standing among the myrtle trees spoke up and said, "These are the ones whom the LORD has sent to walk about<a name="fnB14" href="zec_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> on the earth." 
<bqverse 11>11  The riders then agreed with the angel of the LORD,<a name="fnB15" href="zec_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> who was standing among the myrtle trees, "We have been walking about on the earth, and now everything is at rest and quiet." 
<bqverse 12>12  The angel of the LORD then asked, "sovereign LORD,<a name="fnB16" href="zec_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> how long before you have compassion on Jerusalem and the other cities of Judah which you have been so angry with for these seventy years?"<a name="fnB17" href="zec_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  The LORD then addressed good, comforting words to the angelic messenger who was speaking to me. 
<bqverse 14>14  Turning to me, the messenger then said, "Cry out that the sovereign LORD says, `I am very much moved<a name="fnB18" href="zec_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> for Jerusalem and for Zion. 
<bqverse 15>15  But I am greatly displeased with the nations that take my grace for granted. I was a little displeased with them, but they have only made things worse for themselves.<a name="_Toc494013037"></a></p>
<p><i>The Oracle of Response</i>
<p>
<bqverse 16>16  "`Therefore,' says the LORD, `I have become compassionate<a name="fnB19" href="zec_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> toward Jerusalem and will rebuild my temple<a name="fnB20" href="zec_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> in it, says the sovereign LORD. Once more a surveyor's measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem.' 
<bqverse 17>17  Speak up again with the message of the sovereign LORD: `My cities will once more overflow with prosperity, and once more the LORD will comfort Zion and validate his choice of Jerusalem.'"<a name="_Toc494013038"></a></p>
<p><i>Vision Two: The Four Horns</i>
<p>
<bqverse 18>18 <i>(2.1)</i><a name="fnB21" href="zec_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> Once again I looked and this time I saw four horns. 
<bqverse 19>19  So I asked the angelic messenger<a name="fnB22" href="zec_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> who spoke with me, "What are these?" He replied, "These are the horns<a name="fnB23" href="zec_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem." 
<bqverse 20>20  Next the LORD showed me four blacksmiths.<a name="fnB24" href="zec_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  I asked, "What are these going to do?" He answered, "These horns are the ones that have so scattered Judah so that there is no one to be seen.<a name="fnB25" href="zec_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> But the blacksmiths have come to terrify Judah's enemies<a name="fnB26" href="zec_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> and cut off the horns of the nations that have thrust themselves against the land of Judah in order to scatter its people."<a name="fnB27" href="zec_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqchapter 2>
<a name="_Toc494013039"></a></p>
<p><i>Vision Three: The Surveyor</i>
<p><A NAME="2"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b><i>(2.5)</i>I looked again, and there was a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
<bqverse 2>2  I asked, "Where are you going?" He replied, "To measure Jerusalem in order to determine its width and its length." 
<bqverse 3>3  At this point the angelic messenger<a name="fnB28" href="zec_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> who spoke to me went out, and another messenger came to meet him 
<bqverse 4>4  and said to him, "Hurry, speak to this young man<a name="fnB29" href="zec_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> as follows: `Jerusalem will no longer be enclosed by walls<a name="fnB30" href="zec_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> because of the multitude of people and animals there. 
<bqverse 5>5  But I (the LORD says) will be a wall of fire surrounding Jerusalem<a name="fnB31" href="zec_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> and the source of glory in her midst.'" <p>

<bqverse 6>6  "You there!<a name="fnB32" href="zec_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> Flee from the northland!" says the LORD, "for like the four winds of heaven<a name="fnB33" href="zec_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> I have scattered you," says the LORD. 
<bqverse 7>7  "Escape, Zion, you who live among the Babylonians!"<a name="fnB34" href="zec_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  For the sovereign LORD says to me that for his own glory<a name="fnB35" href="zec_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> he has sent me to the nations that plundered you--for anyone who touches you touches the pupil<a name="fnB36" href="zec_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> of his<a name="fnB37" href="zec_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> eye. 
<bqverse 9>9  "I am about to punish them<a name="fnB38" href="zec_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> in such a way," he says, "that they will be looted by their own slaves." Then you will know that the sovereign LORD has sent me.<p>

<bqverse 10>10  "Sing out and be happy, Zion my daughter!<a name="fnB39" href="zec_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> For look, I have come; I will settle in your midst," says the LORD. 
<bqverse 11>11  "Many nations will join themselves to the LORD on the day of salvation,<a name="fnB40" href="zec_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> and they will also be my<a name="fnB41" href="zec_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> people. Indeed, I will settle in the midst of you all." Then you will know that the sovereign LORD has sent me to you. 
<bqverse 12>12  The LORD will take possession of<a name="fnB42" href="zec_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> Judah as his portion in the holy land and he will choose Jerusalem once again. 
<bqverse 13>13  Be silent in the LORD's presence, all people everywhere,<a name="fnB43" href="zec_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> for he is being moved to action in his holy dwelling place.<a name="fnB44" href="zec_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqchapter 3>
<a name="_Toc494013040"></a></p>
<p><i>Vision Four: The Priest</i>
<p><A NAME="3"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Next I saw Joshua the high priest<a name="fnB45" href="zec_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> standing before the angel of the LORD, with Satan<a name="fnB46" href="zec_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> standing at his right hand to accuse him. 
<bqverse 2>2  The LORD<a name="fnB47" href="zec_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> said to Satan, "May the LORD rebuke you, Satan! may the LORD, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Isn't this man like a burning stick snatched from the fire?" 
<bqverse 3>3  Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes<a name="fnB48" href="zec_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> as he stood there before the angel. 
<bqverse 4>4  The angel<a name="fnB49" href="zec_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> spoke up to those standing all around, "Remove his filthy clothes." Then he said to Joshua, "I have freely forgiven your iniquity and will dress you<a name="fnB50" href="zec_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> in fine clothing." 
<bqverse 5>5  Then I spoke up, "Let a clean turban be put on his head." So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him, while the angel of the LORD stood nearby. 
<bqverse 6>6  Then the angel of the LORD exhorted Joshua solemnly: 
<bqverse 7>7  "The sovereign LORD says, `If you live<a name="fnB51" href="zec_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> and work according to my requirements, you will be able to preside over my temple<a name="fnB52" href="zec_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> and attend to my courtyards; and I will allow you to come and go among these others who are standing by you. 
<bqverse 8>8  Listen now, Joshua the high priest, both you and your colleagues who are sitting before you, all of you<a name="fnB53" href="zec_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> are a symbol that I am about to introduce my servant, the Branch.<a name="fnB54" href="zec_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  As for the stone<a name="fnB55" href="zec_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> I have set before Joshua--on the one stone there are seven eyes.<a name="fnB56" href="zec_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> I am about to engrave an inscription on it,' says the sovereign LORD, `to the effect that I will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day.<a name="fnB57" href="zec_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  In that day,' says the sovereign LORD, `everyone will invite his friend to fellowship under his vine and under his fig tree.'"<a name="fnB58" href="zec_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqchapter 4>
<a name="_Toc494013041"></a></p>
<p><i>Vision Five: The Menorah</i>
<p><A NAME="4"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> The angelic messenger<a name="fnB59" href="zec_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> who had been speaking with me then returned and woke me, as one is wakened from sleep. 
<bqverse 2>2  He asked me, "What do you see?" I replied,<a name="fnB60" href="zec_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> "I see a menorah of pure gold with a receptacle at the top and seven lamps, with fourteen pipes going to the lamps. 
<bqverse 3>3  There are also two olive trees beside it, one on the right of the receptacle and the other on the left."<a name="fnB61" href="zec_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  Then I asked the messenger who spoke with me, "What are these,<a name="fnB62" href="zec_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> sir?" 
<bqverse 5>5  He replied, "Don't you know what these are?" So I responded, "No, sir." 
<bqverse 6>6  Therefore he told me, "These signify the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: `Not by strength and not by power, but by my Spirit,'<a name="fnB63" href="zec_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> says the sovereign LORD."<a name="_Toc494013042"></a></p>
<p><i>Oracle of Response</i>
<p>
<bqverse 7>7  "What are you, you great mountain?<a name="fnB64" href="zec_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> Because of Zerubbabel you will become a level plain! And he will bring forth the temple<a name="fnB65" href="zec_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> capstone with shoutings of `Grace! Grace!'<a name="fnB66" href="zec_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> because of this." 
<bqverse 8>8  Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me as follows: 
<bqverse 9>9  "The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundations of this temple,<a name="fnB67" href="zec_note.htm#fn67"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> and his hands will complete it." Then you will know that the sovereign LORD has sent me to you. 
<bqverse 10>10  For who dares make light of small beginnings? These seven eyes<a name="fnB68" href="zec_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> will joyfully look on the tin tablet<a name="fnB69" href="zec_note.htm#fn69"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> in Zerubbabel's hand. (These are the eyes of the LORD, those that constantly range across the whole earth.)<p>

<bqverse 11>11  Next I asked the messenger, "What are these two olive trees on the right and left of the menorah?" 
<bqverse 12>12  Before he could reply I asked again, "What are these two extensions<a name="fnB70" href="zec_note.htm#fn70"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> of the olive trees, which are emptying out the golden oil through the two golden pipes?" 
<bqverse 13>13  He replied, "Don't you know what these are?" And I said, "No, sir." 
<bqverse 14>14  So he said, "These are the two anointed ones<a name="fnB71" href="zec_note.htm#fn71"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> who stand by the Lord of the whole earth."
<bqchapter 5>
<a name="_Toc494013043"></a></p>
<p><i>Vision Six: The Flying Scroll</i>
<p><A NAME="5"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Then I turned to look, and there was a flying scroll! 
<bqverse 2>2  Someone asked me, "What do you see?" I replied, "I see a flying scroll thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide."<a name="fnB72" href="zec_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  The speaker went on to say, "This is a curse<a name="fnB73" href="zec_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> traveling across the whole earth. For example, according to the curse whoever steals<a name="fnB74" href="zec_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> will be removed from the community; or on the other hand (according to the curse) whoever swears falsely will suffer the same fate." 
<bqverse 4>4  "I will send it out," says the sovereign LORD, "and it will enter the house of the thief and of the person who swears falsely in my name. It will land in the middle of his house and destroy both timber and stones."<a name="_Toc494013044"></a></p>
<p><i>Vision Seven: The Ephah</i>
<p>
<bqverse 5>5  After this the angelic messenger<a name="fnB75" href="zec_note.htm#fn75"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> who had been speaking to me went out and said, "Look, see what is leaving." 
<bqverse 6>6  I asked, "What is it?" And he replied, "It is a basket for measuring grain<a name="fnB76" href="zec_note.htm#fn76"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> that is moving away from here." Moreover, he said, "This is their `eye'<a name="fnB77" href="zec_note.htm#fn77"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> throughout all the earth." 
<bqverse 7>7  Then a round lead cover was raised up, revealing a woman sitting inside the basket. 
<bqverse 8>8  He then said, "This woman represents wickedness," and he pushed her down into the basket and placed the lead cover on top. 
<bqverse 9>9  Then I looked again and saw two women<a name="fnB78" href="zec_note.htm#fn78"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> going forth with the wind in their wings (they had wings like those of a stork) and they lifted up the basket between the earth and the sky. 
<bqverse 10>10  I asked the messenger who was speaking to me, "Where are they taking the basket?" 
<bqverse 11>11  He replied, "To build a temple<a name="fnB79" href="zec_note.htm#fn79"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> for her in the land of Babylonia.<a name="fnB80" href="zec_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> When it is finished, she will be placed there in her own residence."

<a name="_Toc494013045"></a></p>
<p><i>Vision Eight: The Chariots</i>
<p><A NAME="6"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Once more I looked, and this time I saw four chariots emerging from between two mountains of bronze.<a name="fnB81" href="zec_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  Harnessed to the first chariot were red horses, to the second black horses, 
<bqverse 3>3  to the third white horses, and to the fourth spotted horses, all of them strong.<a name="fnB82" href="zec_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  Then I asked the angelic messenger<a name="fnB83" href="zec_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> who was speaking with me, "What are these, sir?" 
<bqverse 5>5  The messenger replied, "These are the four spirits<a name="fnB84" href="zec_note.htm#fn84"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> of heaven that have been presenting themselves before the Lord of all the earth. 
<bqverse 6>6  The chariot with the black horses is going to the north country and the white ones are going after them, but the spotted ones are going to the south country. 
<bqverse 7>7  All these strong ones<a name="fnB85" href="zec_note.htm#fn85"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> are scattering; they have sought permission to go and walk about over the earth." The Lord had said, "Go! Walk about over the earth!" So they are doing so. 
<bqverse 8>8  Then he cried out to me, "Look! The ones going to the northland have brought me<a name="fnB86" href="zec_note.htm#fn86"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> peace about the northland."<a name="fnB87" href="zec_note.htm#fn87"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494013046"></a></p>
<p><i>A Concluding Oracle</i>
<p>
<bqverse 9>9  The word of the LORD came to me as follows: 
<bqverse 10>10  "Choose some people<a name="fnB88" href="zec_note.htm#fn88"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> from among the exiles, namely, Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, all of whom have come from Babylon, and when you have done so go to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah.<a name="fnB89" href="zec_note.htm#fn89"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  Then take some silver and gold to make a crown<a name="fnB90" href="zec_note.htm#fn90"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and set it on the head of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest. 
<bqverse 12>12  Then say to him, `The sovereign LORD says, "Look--here is the man whose name is Branch,<a name="fnB91" href="zec_note.htm#fn91"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> who will sprout up from his place and build the temple of the LORD.

<p><i>The Hypocrisy of False Fasting</i>
<p><A NAME="7"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> In King Darius's fourth year, on the fourth day of <i>Kislev</i>, the ninth month,<a name="fnB96" href="zec_note.htm#fn96"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> the word of the LORD came to Zechariah. 
<bqverse 2>2  Now the people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-Melech and their companions to seek the LORD's favor 
<bqverse 3>3  by asking the priests of the sovereign LORD's temple<a name="fnB97" href="zec_note.htm#fn97"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> and the prophets, "Should we weep in the fifth month,<a name="fnB98" href="zec_note.htm#fn98"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> fasting as we have done over the years?" 
<bqverse 4>4  The word of the sovereign LORD then came to me, 
<bqverse 5>5  "Speak to all the people and priests of the land as follows: `When you fasted and lamented in the fifth and seventh<a name="fnB99" href="zec_note.htm#fn99"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> months through all these seventy years, did you truly fast for me--for me, indeed? 
<bqverse 6>6  And now when you eat and drink, are you not doing so for yourselves?'" 
<bqverse 7>7  Should you not have obeyed the words that the LORD cried out through the former prophets when Jerusalem was peacefully inhabited and her surrounding cities, the Negev, and the Shephelah<a name="fnB100" href="zec_note.htm#fn100"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> were also populated?<p>

<bqverse 8>8  Again the word of the LORD came to Zechariah: 
<bqverse 9>9  "The sovereign LORD said, `Exercise true judgment and show brotherhood and compassion to each other. 
<bqverse 10>10  You must not oppress the widow, the orphan, the foreigner, or the poor, nor should anyone secretly plot evil against his fellow human being.' <p>

<bqverse 11>11  "But they refused to pay attention, turning away stubbornly and stopping their ears so they could not hear. 
<bqverse 12>12  Indeed, they made their heart as hard as diamond,<a name="fnB101" href="zec_note.htm#fn101"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> so that they could not obey the Torah and the other words the sovereign LORD had sent by his Spirit through the former prophets. Therefore, the sovereign LORD had poured out great wrath.<p>

<bqverse 13>13  "`It then came about that just as I<a name="fnB102" href="zec_note.htm#fn102"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> cried out, but they would not obey, so they will cry out, but I will not listen,' the sovereign LORD had said. 
<bqverse 14>14  `Rather, I will sweep them away in a storm into all the nations that they are not familiar with.' Thus the land had become desolate because of them, with no one crossing through or returning, for they had made the fruitful<a name="fnB103" href="zec_note.htm#fn103"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> land a waste."

<p><i>The Blessing of True Fasting</i>
<p><A NAME="8"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Then the word of the sovereign LORD<a name="fnB104" href="zec_note.htm#fn104"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> came to me as follows: 
<bqverse 2>2  "The sovereign LORD says, `I am very much concerned for Zion; indeed, I am so concerned for her that my rage will fall on those who hurt her.' 
<bqverse 3>3  The Lord says, `I have returned to Zion and will live within Jerusalem. Now Jerusalem will be called "truthful city," "mountain of the sovereign LORD," "holy mountain."' 
<bqverse 4>4  Moreover, the sovereign LORD says, `Old men and women will once more live in the plazas of Jerusalem, each one leaning on a cane because of advanced age. 
<bqverse 5>5  And the streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing.<a name="fnB105" href="zec_note.htm#fn105"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  And,' says the sovereign LORD, `though such a thing may seem to be difficult in the opinion of the small community of those days, will it also appear difficult to me?' asks the sovereign LORD. <p>

<bqverse 7>7  "The sovereign LORD asserts, `I am about to save my people from the lands of the east and the west. 
<bqverse 8>8  And I will bring them to settle within Jerusalem. They will be my people, and I will be their God,<a name="fnB106" href="zec_note.htm#fn106"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> in truth and righteousness.'<p>

<bqverse 9>9  "The sovereign LORD also says, `Gather strength, you who are listening to these words today from the mouths of the prophets who were there at the founding of the house of the sovereign LORD,<a name="fnB107" href="zec_note.htm#fn107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> so that the temple might be built. 
<bqverse 10>10  Before that time there was no compensation for man or animal, nor was there any relief from adversity for those who came and went, because I had pitted everybody--each one--against everyone else. 
<bqverse 11>11  But I will be different now to this remnant of my people from the way I was in those days,' says the sovereign LORD, 
<bqverse 12>12  `for there will be a peaceful time of sowing, the vine will produce its fruit and the ground its yield, and the skies<a name="fnB108" href="zec_note.htm#fn108"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> will rain down dew. Then I will allow the remnant of my people to possess all these things. 
<bqverse 13>13  And it will come about that just as you (both Judah and Israel) were a curse to the nations, so I will save you and you will be a blessing. Do not be afraid! Instead, be strong!'<p>

<bqverse 14>14  "For the sovereign LORD says, `As I had planned to hurt<a name="fnB109" href="zec_note.htm#fn109"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> you when your fathers made me angry,' says the sovereign LORD, `and I was not sorry, 
<bqverse 15>15  so, to the contrary, I have planned in these days to do good to Jerusalem and Judah--do not fear! 
<bqverse 16>16  These are the things you must do: Speak the truth, each of you, to one another. Practice true and righteous judgment in your courts.<a name="fnB110" href="zec_note.htm#fn110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  Do not plan evil in your hearts against one another. Do not favor a false oath--these are all things that I hate,' says the LORD." <p>

<bqverse 18>18  The word of the sovereign LORD came to me as follows: 
<bqverse 19>19  "The sovereign LORD says, `The fast of the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth<a name="fnB111" href="zec_note.htm#fn111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> months will become joyful and happy, pleasant feasts for the house of Judah, so love truth and peace.' 
<bqverse 20>20  The sovereign LORD says, `It will someday come to pass that people--residents of many cities--will come. 
<bqverse 21>21  The inhabitants of one will go to another and say, "Let's go up at once to ask the favor of the LORD, to seek the sovereign LORD. Indeed, I'll go with you."' 
<bqverse 22>22  Many peoples and powerful nations will come to seek the sovereign LORD in Jerusalem and to seek his favor. 
<bqverse 23>23  The sovereign LORD says, `In those days ten people from all languages and nations will grasp hold of--indeed, grab--the robe of one Jew and say, "Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you."'"<a name="fnB112" href="zec_note.htm#fn112"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a>

The eyes of all humanity,<a name="fnB115" href="zec_note.htm#fn115"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> especially of the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD, 
<bqverse 2>2  as are those of Hamath also, which adjoins Damascus, and Tyre and Sidon, though they consider themselves to be very wise. 
<bqverse 3>3  Tyre built herself a fortification and piled up silver like dust and gold like the mud of the streets! 
<bqverse 4>4  Nevertheless the Lord will evict her and shove her fortifications<a name="fnB116" href="zec_note.htm#fn116"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> into the sea--she will be consumed by fire. 
<bqverse 5>5  Ashkelon will see and be afraid; Gaza will be in great anguish, as will Ekron, for her hope will have been dried up.<a name="fnB117" href="zec_note.htm#fn117"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> Gaza will lose her king, and Ashkelon will no longer be inhabited. 
<bqverse 6>6  A mongrel people will live in Ashdod, for I will greatly humiliate the Philistines. 
<bqverse 7>7  I will take away their abominable religious practices;<a name="fnB118" href="zec_note.htm#fn118"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> then those who survive will become a community of believers in our God,<a name="fnB119" href="zec_note.htm#fn119"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> like a clan in Judah, and Ekron will be like the Jebusites. 
<bqverse 8>8  Then I will surround my temple<a name="fnB120" href="zec_note.htm#fn120"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> to protect it like a guard<a name="fnB121" href="zec_note.htm#fn121"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> from anyone crossing back and forth; so no one will cross over against them anymore as an oppressor, for now I myself have seen it.</p>
<br>
<bqverse 9>9  Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion!<br>

Look! Your king is coming to you:<br>
he is legitimate<a name="fnB122" href="zec_note.htm#fn122"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and victorious,<a name="fnB123" href="zec_note.htm#fn123"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 11>11  Moreover, as for you, because of our covenant relationship secured with blood, I will release your prisoners from the waterless pit. 
<bqverse 12>12  Return to the stronghold, you prisoners, with hope; today I declare that I will return double what was taken from you. 
<bqverse 13>13  I will bend Judah as my bow; I will load the bow with Ephraim, my arrow!<a name="fnB127" href="zec_note.htm#fn127"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> I will stir up your sons, Zion, against yours, Greece, and I will make you, Zion,<a name="fnB128" href="zec_note.htm#fn128"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> like a warrior's sword. <p>

<bqverse 14>14  Then the LORD will appear above them, and his arrow will shoot forth like lightning; the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet and will sally forth on the southern storm winds. 
<bqverse 15>15  The sovereign LORD will guard them, and they will prevail and overcome with sling stones.

<bqverse 16>16  On that day the LORD their God will deliver them as the flock of his people, for they are the precious stones of a crown sparkling over his land.

<bqverse 3>3  I am enraged at the shepherds and will punish the lead-goats.<p>

<bqverse 2>2  Howl, fir tree,<br>

Howl, oaks of Bashan, <br>
because the impenetrable forest has fallen.<br>

<bqverse 3>3  Listen to the howling of shepherds, <br>
because their magnificence has been destroyed.<br>
Listen to the roaring of young lions, <br>
because the thickets of the Jordan have been devastated.</ul><p>
<bqverse 4>4  The LORD my God says this: "Shepherd the flock set aside for slaughter. 
<bqverse 5>5  Those who buy them<a name="fnB149" href="zec_note.htm#fn149"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> slaughter them and are not held guilty; those who sell them say, `Blessed be the LORD, for I am rich.' Their own shepherds have no compassion for them. 
<bqverse 6>6  Indeed, I will no longer have compassion on the people of the land," says the LORD, "but instead I will turn every last person over to his neighbor and his king. They will devastate the land, and I will not deliver it from them."<p>

<bqverse 7>7  So I<a name="fnB150" href="zec_note.htm#fn150"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> began to shepherd the flock destined for slaughter, the most afflicted<a name="fnB151" href="zec_note.htm#fn151"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> of all the flock. Then I took two staffs,<a name="fnB152" href="zec_note.htm#fn152"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> calling one "pleasantness"<a name="fnB153" href="zec_note.htm#fn153"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> and the other "binders,"<a name="fnB154" href="zec_note.htm#fn154"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> and I tended the flock. 
<bqverse 8>8  Next I eradicated the three shepherds in one month,<a name="fnB155" href="zec_note.htm#fn155"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> for I ran out of patience with them and, indeed, they detested me as well. 
<bqverse 9>9  I then said, "I will not shepherd you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be eradicated, let it be eradicated. As for those who survive, let them eat each other's flesh." <p>

<bqverse 10>10  Then I took my staff "pleasantness" and cut it in two to annul my covenant that I had made with all the people. 
<bqverse 11>11  So it was annulled that very day, and then the most afflicted of the flock who kept faith with me knew that that was the word of the LORD.<p>

<bqverse 12>12  Then I<a name="fnB156" href="zec_note.htm#fn156"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> said to them, "If it seems good to you, pay me my wages, but if not, forget it."

<bqverse 13>13  The LORD then said to me, "Throw to the potter that exorbitant sum<a name="fnB158" href="zec_note.htm#fn158"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> at which they valued me!" So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter<a name="fnB159" href="zec_note.htm#fn159"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> at the temple<a name="fnB160" href="zec_note.htm#fn160"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> of the LORD. 
<bqverse 14>14  Then I cut the second staff, "binders," in two in order to annul the covenant of brotherhood between Judah and Israel.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  Again the LORD said to me, "Take up once more the equipment of a foolish shepherd.<a name="fnB161" href="zec_note.htm#fn161"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  Indeed, I am about to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not take heed to the sheep headed to slaughter, will not seek the scattered, and will not heal the injured.<a name="fnB162" href="zec_note.htm#fn162"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> Moreover, he will not nourish the one that is healthy but instead will eat the meat of the fat sheep<a name="fnB163" href="zec_note.htm#fn163"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> and tear off their hoofs.</p>

<bqverse 6>6 On that day<a name="fnB170" href="zec_note.htm#fn170"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> I will make the leaders of Judah like an igniter<a name="fnB171" href="zec_note.htm#fn171"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> among sticks and a burning torch among sheaves, and they will burn up all the surrounding nations right and left. Then the people of Jerusalem will settle once more in their place, the city of Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 7>7  The LORD also will deliver the homes<a name="fnB172" href="zec_note.htm#fn172"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> of Judah first, so that the splendor of the kingship<a name="fnB173" href="zec_note.htm#fn173"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> of David and of the people of Jerusalem may not exceed that of Judah. 
<bqverse 8>8  On that day the LORD himself will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the weakest among them will be like mighty David, and the dynasty of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD before them.<a name="fnB174" href="zec_note.htm#fn174"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  So on that day I will set out to destroy all the nations<a name="fnB175" href="zec_note.htm#fn175"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> that come against Jerusalem."<p>

<bqverse 10>10  "I will pour out upon the kingship<a name="fnB176" href="zec_note.htm#fn176"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> of David and the population of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication so that they will look to me,<a name="fnB177" href="zec_note.htm#fn177"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> the one they have pierced. They will lament for him as one laments for an only son, and there will be a bitter cry for him like the bitter cry for a firstborn.<a name="fnB178" href="zec_note.htm#fn178"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  On that day the lamentation in Jerusalem will be as great as the lamentation at Hadad-Rimmon<a name="fnB179" href="zec_note.htm#fn179"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> in the plain of Megiddo. 
<bqverse 12>12  The land will mourn, clan by clan--the clan of the royal household of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the clan of the family of Nathan<a name="fnB180" href="zec_note.htm#fn180"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> by itself and their wives by themselves; 
<bqverse 13>13  the clan of the descendants of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; and the clan of the Shimeites<a name="fnB181" href="zec_note.htm#fn181"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> by itself and their wives by themselves-- 
<bqverse 14>14  all the clans that remain, each separately with their wives."

<p><i>The Refinement of Judah</i>

<bqverse 1>1 </b> "In that day there will be a fountain opened up for the dynasty<a name="fnB182" href="zec_note.htm#fn182"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> of David and the people of Jerusalem for sin and impurity.<a name="fnB183" href="zec_note.htm#fn183"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  And also on that day," says the sovereign LORD, "I will remove<a name="fnB184" href="zec_note.htm#fn184"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> the names of the idols from the land and they will never again be remembered. Moreover, I will remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land. 
<bqverse 3>3 Then, if anyone prophesies in spite of this, his father and mother who bore him will say to him, `You cannot live, for you lie in the name of the LORD.' Then his father and mother who bore him will run him through with a sword when he prophesies.<a name="fnB185" href="zec_note.htm#fn185"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 4>4  "Therefore, on that day each prophet will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies and will no longer wear the hairy garment<a name="fnB186" href="zec_note.htm#fn186"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> of a prophet to deceive the people.<a name="fnB187" href="zec_note.htm#fn187"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  Instead he will say, `I am no prophet--indeed, I am a farmer, for a man has made me his indentured servant since my youth.'<a name="fnB188" href="zec_note.htm#fn188"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  Then someone will ask him, `What are these wounds on your chest?'<a name="fnB189" href="zec_note.htm#fn189"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> and he will answer, `Some that I received in the house of my friends.'</p>

<bqverse 7>7  "Awake, sword, against my shepherd,<br>

Strike the shepherd that the flock may be scattered;<a name="fnB190" href="zec_note.htm#fn190"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a><br>
I will turn my hand against the insignificant ones.<br>

<bqverse 8>8  It will happen in all the land, says the LORD,<br>
that two-thirds of the people<a name="fnB191" href="zec_note.htm#fn191"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> in it will be cut off and die,<br>

<bqverse 9>9  Then I will bring the remaining third into the fire;<br>
I will refine them like silver is refined<br>

They will call on my name and I will answer;<br>
I will say, `These are my people,' <br>

<bqchapter 14>
<a name="_Toc494013054"></a></ul><p><i>The Sovereignty of the LORD</i>
<p><A NAME="14"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> A day of the LORD<a name="fnB194" href="zec_note.htm#fn194"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> is about to come when your possessions<a name="fnB195" href="zec_note.htm#fn195"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> will be divided as plunder in your midst. 
<bqverse 2>2  For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to wage war; the city will be taken, its houses plundered, and the women raped. Then half of the city will go into exile, but the remainder of the people will not be taken away.<a name="fnB196" href="zec_note.htm#fn196"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 3>3  Then the LORD will go to battle<a name="fnB197" href="zec_note.htm#fn197"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> and fight against those nations, just as he fought battles in ancient days.<a name="fnB198" href="zec_note.htm#fn198"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives which lies to the east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in half from east to west, leaving a great valley. Half the mountain will move northward and the other half southward.<a name="fnB199" href="zec_note.htm#fn199"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  Then you will escape<a name="fnB200" href="zec_note.htm#fn200"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> through my mountain valley, for the mountains will extend to Azal.<a name="fnB201" href="zec_note.htm#fn201"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> Indeed, you will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of King Uzziah<a name="fnB202" href="zec_note.htm#fn202"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> of Judah. Then the LORD my God will come with all his holy ones with him. 
<bqverse 6>6  On that day there will be no light--the sources of light in the heavens will congeal.<a name="fnB203" href="zec_note.htm#fn203"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  It will happen in one day (a day known to the LORD); not in the day or the night, but in the evening there will be light.<a name="fnB204" href="zec_note.htm#fn204"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  Moreover, on that day living waters will flow out from Jerusalem,<a name="fnB205" href="zec_note.htm#fn205"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> half of them to the eastern sea<a name="fnB206" href="zec_note.htm#fn206"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> and half of them to the western sea;<a name="fnB207" href="zec_note.htm#fn207"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> it will happen both in summer and in winter.<p>

<bqverse 9>9  The LORD will then be king over all the earth. In that day the LORD will be seen as one with a single name.<a name="fnB208" href="zec_note.htm#fn208"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  All the land will change and become like the Arabah<a name="fnB209" href="zec_note.htm#fn209"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> from Geba to Rimmon,<a name="fnB210" href="zec_note.htm#fn210"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> south of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem will be raised up and will stay in its own place from the Benjamin Gate to the site of the First Gate<a name="fnB211" href="zec_note.htm#fn211"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and on to the Corner Gate,<a name="fnB212" href="zec_note.htm#fn212"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses.<a name="fnB213" href="zec_note.htm#fn213"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  And people will settle there, and there will no longer be the threat of divine extermination--Jerusalem will dwell in security. <p>

<bqverse 12>12  But this will be the nature of the plague with which the LORD will strike all the nations that have fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh will decay while they stand on their feet, their eyes will rot away in their sockets, and their tongues will dissolve in their mouths. 
<bqverse 13>13 On that day there will be great confusion from the LORD among them; they will seize each other and attack one another violently. 
<bqverse 14>14  Moreover, Judah will fight at<a name="fnB214" href="zec_note.htm#fn214"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> Jerusalem, and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered up<a name="fnB215" href="zec_note.htm#fn215"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a>--gold, silver, and clothing in great abundance. 
<bqverse 15>15  This is the kind of plague that will devastate horses, mules, camels, donkeys, and all the other animals in those camps. <p>

<bqverse 16>16  Then all who survive from all the nations that came to attack Jerusalem will go up annually to worship the King, the sovereign LORD, and to observe the Feast of Tabernacles.<a name="fnB216" href="zec_note.htm#fn216"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  But if any of the nations anywhere on earth refuse to go up to Jerusalem<a name="fnB217" href="zec_note.htm#fn217"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> to worship the King, the sovereign LORD, they will get no rain. 
<bqverse 18>18  If the Egyptians will not do so, they will get no rain--instead there will be the kind of plague which the LORD inflicts on any nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. 
<bqverse 19>19  This will be the punishment of Egypt and of all nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. <p>

<bqverse 20>20  On that day the bells of the horses will bear the inscription "HOLY TO THE LORD." The cookings pots in the LORD's temple<a name="fnB218" href="zec_note.htm#fn218"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> will be as holy as the bowls in front of the altar.<a name="fnB219" href="zec_note.htm#fn219"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and Judah will become holy in the sight of the sovereign LORD, so that all who offer sacrifices may come and use some of them to boil their sacrifices in them. There will no longer be a Canaanite<a name="fnB220" href="zec_note.htm#fn220"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> in the house of the sovereign LORD on that day.</p>
