<FONT SIZE=3><P>Welcome to the NET Bible! What you have in your handsвЂ”or on your computer monitor, laptop, or PDAвЂ”represents a new approach to Bible translation for the electronic age and for the next millennium. Never before in the history of the Bible has a translation been published in electronic form on the Internet <I>before</I> being published in traditional print media. Never before has a translation been published which includes explanatory notes from the translators and editors as to <I>why</I> the preferred translation was chosen and what the alternatives are. Never before has a translation committee invited public comment on the working drafts of the translation via the Internet, whether from laypersons, clergy, or biblical scholars. </P>
<P>With a translation so revolutionary as the NET Bible, you no doubt have some additional questions. The remainder of this Preface addresses in question-and-answer format the most frequently-asked questions, to help you understand what the NET Bible is about and how it differs from the many other Bible translations available to the English-speaking reader today. </P>
<I><P><A NAME="_Toc485059545">What is the NET Bible?</A></P>
</I><P>The New English Translation, also known as the NET Bible, is a completely new translation of the Bible, not a revision or an update of a previous English version. It was completed by more than twenty biblical scholars who worked directly from the best currently available Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts. These scholars teach biblical exegesis in seminaries and graduate schools. Further, the original translator for each book was chosen in every instance because of his or her work in that particular bookвЂ”often extending over several decades. Many of the translators have participated in other translation projects as well. They have been assisted by doctoral students and advised by style consultants and SIL field translators. Hence, the notes alone are the fruit of hundreds of thousands of hours of biblical and linguistic research.</P>
<I><P><A NAME="_Toc485059546">Why do we need yet another translation of the Bible?</A></P>
</I><P>With over twenty-five different English translations of the entire Bible and approximately forty of the New Testament, an obvious question you may ask is, why another one? The project originally started as an attempt to provide an electronic version of a modern translation for electronic distribution over the Internet and on CD (compact disc). Electronic searchable versions of a contemporary English translation tend to be very expensive. Anyone anywhere in the world with an Internet connection will be able to use and print out the NET Bible without cost for personal study. In addition anyone who wants to share the Bible with others can print up to 1,000 copies and give them away free without the need for written permission. Pastors without expensive libraries, missionaries and Bible translators in the field, and people in countries where access to Bible study materials are restricted or prohibited will all benefit from access to a contemporary English translation with extensive notes. The notes accompanying the NET Bible can even help you understand <I>other </I>translations better. Ultimately what you have in your hands or on your computer monitor with this copy of the NET Bible is GodвЂ™s Word, and we believe it should be available to everyone to read and study in a version that is accurate, readable, and affordable.</P>
<P>It is not just the new media that justifies this translation; a great deal of scholarly literature has been produced on biblical interpretation and translation in the last quarter of a century. While virtually all other translations produced in the last two decades of the twentieth century were revisions of earlier versions, the NET translators felt that an entirely different kind of translation was needed. In particular, the extensive notes that display for the reader the reasons for the translation are unique among Bible translations. Further, the translation itself is intended to capture the best of both worlds: readable <I>and</I> accurate. </P>
<I><P><A NAME="_Toc485059547">How did we get our English Bible?</A></P>
</I><P>The history of the BibleвЂ™s translation into English is a long and complicated one, and can only be summarized here. Parts of the Bible appear to have been translated into Old English by Alfred the Great (died a.d. 901), including the Ten Commandments, parts of Exodus 21-23 and Acts 15, and a number of Psalms. Later in the tenth century Abbot Aelfric and perhaps others translated significant parts of the Old Testament into English, as well as the Gospels and some other New Testament books.</P>
<P>By around 1300 parts of the Psalms and the New Testament were being translated into Middle English. These were precursors of the famous versions associated with John Wycliffe (died a.d. 1384). The tradition that Wycliffe himself translated the Bible into English is founded on a statement by his follower Jan Hus. Whether he actually did the translation himself or it was carried out by his followers, he doubtless exerted a great influence over it. These translations were based on the Latin Vulgate, originally the work of Jerome, which was finished at the beginning of the fifth century a.d. and which became the standard Bible of the Western church throughout the Middle Ages.</P>
<P>Several other events in Europe had a significant impact on the history of the English Bible at this point. First was the general revival of learning in Europe known as the Renaissance, which brought about renewed interest in Hebrew and Greek, the original languages of the Bible. Second was the invention of the printing press ca. 1455 by Johannes Gutenberg (the first book he printed was a Bible). The third event occurred when Martin Luther nailed his ninety-five theses to the door of the church in Wittenberg in 1517, setting in motion the Protestant Reformation. These events combined to give considerable momentum to the translation of the Bible into everyday language. LutherвЂ™s New Testament, translated from the Greek into German, appeared in 1522, while William TyndaleвЂ™s, translated from the Greek into English, followed in 1525. Tyndale was arrested in Antwerp in 1535 and executed for translating the Bible into the vernacular, and his translation was vilified by the authorities. Yet almost every English translation for the next hundred years borrowed heavily from TyndaleвЂ™s work, including in particular the King James Version of 1611. Before this landmark in the history of English Bibles, however, there were other translations, like CoverdaleвЂ™s in 1535 and the version called MatthewвЂ™s Bible in 1537. Both these Bibles received the royal license in 1537. The year 1539 saw the appearance of the so-called &quot;Great Bible,&quot; actually a revision of MatthewвЂ™s Bible by Coverdale, which by royal decree of Henry VIII was placed in every church in England.</P>
<P>The reign of Elizabeth I saw the production of two more English Bibles, the Geneva Bible (published in 1560 in Geneva, with a dedication to Elizabeth) and the BishopsвЂ™ Bible (1568, with a second edition in 1572). The former was the Bible used by Shakespeare, and was thoroughly Calvinistic in its translation and notes. It was so far superior in translation to the Great Bible that it became very popular, although the Anglican authorities were not pleased with its Calvinistic leanings. The BishopsвЂ™ Bible was prepared as a response, and English-speaking Protestantism was left at the end of the sixteenth century with two competing Bibles. The problem was not resolved until the Hampton Court Conference of 1604, when King James authorized a new translation of the Bible and specifically forbade the use of marginal notes commenting on doctrine (notes commenting on the sense of words were permitted, and the original King James Version contained thousands of these). Gradually this translation established itself as <I>the</I> English Bible par excellence, and the last edition of the Geneva Bible appeared in 1644.</P>
<P>Until 1885, when the Revised Version was published in England, the King James Version reigned supreme. An American version of the revision, known as the American Standard Version, was published in 1901. The twentieth century saw the publication of a number of Bibles and New Testaments, among them James MoffattвЂ™s (NT 1913; OT 1924) and E. J. GoodspeedвЂ™s (NT 1923), which combined with the Old Testament by A. Gordon, T. Meek, J. M. Powis Smith, and L. Waterman (1935) was published the same year as <I>The Bible: An American Translation</I>. One of the most important English translations of the twentieth century was the Revised Standard Version (NT 1946; complete Bible, 1952). This was a thoroughgoing revision of the KJV and ASV which many consider to be the first of the &quot;modern&quot; translations. The publication of the RSV was only the beginning of a flood of translations and paraphrases, including (among others) J. B. PhillipsвЂ™ <I>The New Testament in Modern English</I> (1958), the Amplified Bible (1965), the Jerusalem Bible (1966), the New American Bible (1970), the New English Bible (1970), the New American Standard Bible (1971), <I>The Living Bible</I> (1971), and the New International Version (1973). </P>
<P>More than twenty-five years have passed since the release of the NIV New Testament. This major English translation is taken as a benchmark because it was not a revision or update of an existing translation or a successor to a previous translation. During these twenty-five years neither biblical scholarship nor the English language itself has stood still. The NET Bible is the first completely new translation of the Bible to be done in the age of the Internet (World Wide Web) with full computer networking support. Biblical scholars exchanged not only email but entire documents over computer networks and the Internet for constant editorial revision and correction. The NET Bible truly is the first English translation for the next millennium, representing a step as significant as GutenbergвЂ™s invention of the printing press in 1455. The original authors of the Bible made the books and letters they had written available for free. That is what we are now doing electronically.</P>
<I><P><A NAME="_Toc485059548">What is unique and distinctive about the NET Bible?</A></P>
</I><P>Working with the format of electronic media, it soon became apparent to those of us involved in the translation project that we could do some things that had not been possible before, given the limitations of traditional print media.</P>

<br>
<LI>First, the NET Bible includes extensive notes with the translation, notes that operate on more than one levelвЂ”a technical level for pastors, teachers, and students of Greek and Hebrew who are interested in the grammatical, syntactical, and text-critical details of the translation, and a more popular level comparable to current study Bibles offering explanatory details of interest to lay Bible students. In electronic format the length of these notes, a considerable problem with conventional printed Bibles, is no longer a major limitation. </LI>
<LI>Second, within the technical notes the translation team has taken the opportunity to explain and defend the translation given for a particular verse or passage. </LI>
<LI>Third, the translators and editors used the notes to show major interpretive options and/or textual options for difficult or disputed passages, so that the user knows at a glance what the alternatives are. </LI>
<LI>Fourth, the translators and editors used the notes to give a translation that was formally equivalent, while placing a somewhat more dynamically equivalent translation in the text itself to promote better readability and understandability.</LI>
<LI>Finally, the use of electronic media gives the translators and editors of the NET Bible the possibility of continually updating and improving the translation and notes.</LI></UL>

<P>In short, the notes allow a sort of running commentary on the biblical text to a degree never seen before in modern translations of the Bible. The NET Bible New Testament with the complete set of translatorвЂ™s footnotes is not just a readable modern translation, but a copy of the Bible with its own commentary attached containing an average of two notes for each verse.</P>
<I><P><A NAME="_Toc485059549">How did the NET Bible project get started?</A></P>
</I><P>The project began in November 1995 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at the annual meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature. There a group of Old and New Testament scholars met with the sponsor of the project to discuss the possibility of an English translation for electronic distribution over the Internet. While the initial discussions concerned a revision and update of some existing English translation, later discussions soon made it apparent that a completely new translation was both possible and desirable. The initial planning group was interdenominational and evangelical, although not made up of official representatives from church groups or denominations. A deliberate decision was made early on, however, to devote special attention to the avoidance of doctrinal peculiarities or sectarian bias.</P>
<I><P><A NAME="_Toc485059550">What is the significance of the NET BibleвЂ™s name and logo?</A></P>
</I><P>A name and logo were chosen that would reflect our goals to provide the Bible to the electronic Internet audience as well as to readers of printed Bibles. Users of the Internet can relate to the NET Bible as an obvious name, plus the phrase &quot;New English Translation&quot; fits well with the abbreviation. Our logo reflects a simple computer mouse linked to an open electronic Bible in the form of a net. This net represents a virtual fishermanвЂ™s net, to catch people on the Internet.</P>
<I><P><A NAME="_Toc485059551">What was the size of the NET Bible Translation Committee?</A></P>
</I><P>A major consideration was the size of the translation committee. More than one person should do the work of translation, to avoid the unintentional idiosyncrasies that inevitably result from an individual working in isolation from a community of colleagues. At the same time, it was obvious to all of us that a smaller group of about twenty scholars who shared a number of basic assumptions and followed generally similar approaches to the biblical text in terms of interpretive method and general philosophy of translation would be able to work far faster than a larger committee. In addition, large committees are subject to more differences of opinion, forcing compromise and producing an output that is often neither elegant nor vivid. Our assumptions about the speed with which a smaller team could work proved to be the case, since the time from the commencement of the project to the completion of the first release version of the New Testament (version 1.0) was a remarkable thirty-two months.</P>
<I><P><A NAME="_Toc485059552">What do you mean when you say the NET Bible was beta tested?</A></P>
</I><P>Since the NET Bible is the first English translation done entirely in paperless form, an idea was borrowed from software developers, an idea which did not exist when the NIV New Testament was completed in 1973вЂ”a beta test. How does someone beta test the Bible? Just like beta testing software, we let people try it and tell us where it could be improved.</P>
<P>By publishing <I>every</I> working draft of the NET Bible on the Internet from the very beginning of the project, more people have previewed the NET Bible than any translation in history. These prepublication reviewers of the NET Bible have logged over one million review sessions and sent the translation committee countless comments. The committee always takes each of these user-comments seriously and many have substantially improved the translation. The translation committee continues to solicit comments to improve both the translation and the notes.</P>
<P>Now the complete NET Bible is available in both electronic and printed form. You have the opportunity to learn from a truly detailed, totally new Bible translation, plus our invitation to help us continue to improve the translation through its ongoing development. This is unique in history.</P>
<I><P><A NAME="_Toc485059553">Can I still submit suggestions for future improvements?</A> </P>
</I><P>Absolutely. The goal of this translation is to be clear and detailed. While we think weвЂ™re close, that doesnвЂ™t mean we have yet achieved perfection. If you come across a phrase or verse you feel needs improvement, you can send an e-mail to <BR>
&lt; comments@netbible.org &gt;.</P>
<P>There are four levels of comments that we request:</P>
<OL>

<LI>IвЂ™m not an expert in Greek or Hebrew, but I donвЂ™t understand the English meaning of this verse. It uses awkward grammar or words that arenвЂ™t in normal English usage. (Translation reflecting normal English usage was the primary goal of the original King James Bible.)</LI>
<LI>IвЂ™m a scholar in the BibleвЂ™s original languages, and (a) I really think you could better translate this verse this wayвЂ¦; (b) hereвЂ™s what your translation falsely implies in English which was not a nuance of the original; (c) hereвЂ™s why people of my background will interpret the English phrase in a strange fashion.</LI>
<LI>There is reasonable division of opinion about this verseвЂ™s implications among honest Bible students; a more balanced footnote is needed. (Here you may specify the view you would like to see represented.)</LI>
<LI>Other comments and endorsements: We donвЂ™t request only comments suggesting improvements. We would also like to hear of specific passages where you particularly like what we have done or other features of the NET Bible that you are impressed with. Additionally, we would be very pleased to have your endorsement of the NET Bible.</LI></OL>

<I><P><A NAME="_Toc485059554">How was the NET Bible actually made?</A></P>
</I><P>The procedure followed in the making of the NET Bible involved the assignment of each book of the Old or New Testament to an individual scholar who was well versed in the interpretation of that particular book and in most cases had extensive experience in doing research, teaching, and writing about the book. These scholars produced an initial draft translation of the books assigned to them along with a preliminary set of translatorвЂ™s notes (and in some cases text-critical notes and study notes as well). This work was then submitted to the New Testament or Old Testament editorial committee for extensive editing and/or revision. In some cases suggested revisions in form and content were carried out by the original translator, while in other cases an editor reworked the draft translation as needed. The work was then resubmitted to the editorial committee for final approval. An English style consultant, working independently of the appropriate committee, reviewed the translation for smoothness, clarity, and elegance of contemporary English style. Changes suggested by the style consultant were checked against the original Hebrew, Aramaic, or Greek before final incorporation into the translation. In most cases a minimum of three different individuals edited and revised each book of the Bible. In this way the final release version of the NET Bible was checked and revised a number of times at different levels for accuracy, clarity, and English style. Finally it was proofread and field-tested a number of times. Countless hours of research, translation, revision, and interaction thus went into the production of the NET Bible.</P>
<I><P><A NAME="_Toc485059555">Who decided what kind of translation the NET Bible was going to be?</A></P>
</I><P>No denomination, church, agency, or publisher determined the nature of the NET Bible translation beforehand. It was a translation conceived and designed by biblical scholars who were primarily specialists in the biblical languages and in the exegesis (interpretation) of the biblical text. At the beginning of the project the Executive Steering Committee, composed of members of both the Old and New Testament editorial committees and the project director, held extensive discussions before approving the &quot;Guidelines for Translators&quot; (see the reference material at the end) which set forth the basic character of the NET Bible translation and notes. Faithfulness to the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek in which the biblical documents were originally written was the primary concern. This frequently extended to the connectives (&quot;for,&quot; &quot;then,&quot; &quot;so,&quot; &quot;now&quot;) used to introduce clauses, sentences, and paragraphs in the original languages. These conjunctions are often omitted in contemporary English translations since current English style does not use them very often to indicate transitions and argument flow. The Executive Steering Committee felt, however, that in many cases it was important for the modern readerвЂ™s understanding to preserve these connections. (In some cases where this would result in awkward English style, these conjunctions have been indicated in the notes that accompany the text.)</P>
<I><P>What are the chief characteristics of the NET Bible as a translation?</P>
</I><P>The ultimate objective of the NET Bible is to be accurate, readable, and elegant. Yet these three principles are all too often in conflict with each other. Even a universal taxonomy will not work, because some passages pose special problems (such as liturgical use, familiarity, connections with the Old Testament, theological richness, and the like) that would override any rigid taxonomy.</P>
<P>As an illustration of the complexity of competing principles, consider the LordвЂ™s declaration in Mark
<bqverse 17>17 : &quot;I will make you fishers of men.&quot; This wording, found in the KJV, RSV, NASB, NIV, REB, and ultimately going back to Tyndale, is familiar to church-goers. But in contemporary English it communicates a meaning that slightly deviates from the point: Jesus did not just want his apostles to evangelize adult males, but all people (the Greek is </FONT><FONT FACE="Greek">aJlie'" ajnqrwvpwn</FONT><FONT SIZE=3>, </FONT><FONT FACE="Greektl">Jalie" anqrwpwn</FONT><FONT SIZE=3>). But there is a second problem with this verse: &quot;<I>fishers</I> of men&quot; is archaic. The NRSV opts for &quot;I will make you fish for people.&quot; This resolves the two problems of the older translations, but introduces two others. First, it sounds as if Jesus will <I>force</I> the disciples to &quot;fish for people&quot;; second, the conversion of the objective genitive to an object of the preposition results in a subtle shift from a focus on a new occupation to a mere activity. The NLT and TEV get past the first problem but not the second (&quot;I will show you how to fish for people,&quot; &quot;I will teach you to catch people&quot;). So, how best to solve the dilemma? The full meaning of JesusвЂ™ declaration includes both non-exclusive evangelism and implications of an occupational shift. It is too cumbersome to express this as &quot;I will make you fishermen of people,&quot; though the archaism is removed. Nor is it correct to translate this as &quot;I will make you fishers of mankind&quot; because that would imply a mission to gentiles which the disciples could not have conceived of at this time in redemptive history. This text illustrates the clash of the translational objectives of accuracy, readability, and elegance. At bottom, we believe that the great value of the NET Bible is its extensive notes that wrestle with such issues, for the footnotes become a way for us to have our cake and eat it too. But on this passageвЂ”for nowвЂ”we have settled on the translation, &quot;I will turn you into fishers of people.&quot; We have retained an archaism both because of its familiarity and because the alternative &quot;fishermen&quot; was too inelegant. The object complement construction was rendered &quot;turn you into fishers&quot; instead of &quot;make you fishers&quot; both because of its clarity and the hint of the disciplesвЂ™ conversion as a prerequisite to their new occupation. We chose not to go with the more natural but less accurate rendering of &quot;I will teach you to catch people.&quot; In <I>this</I> passage, accuracy was more important than readability or elegance. But a decision was not easy; we are still open to suggestions.</P>
<I><P><A NAME="_Toc485059556">Is a literal translation the best translation?</A></P>
</I><P>Although one of the general principles of this translation is to indicate in the footnotes a more literal rendering, not every departure from such is noted. For one thing, Greek (or Hebrew) and English are sufficiently different that to document every departure would be an exercise in futility. No translation is completely literal, nor should that be a desirable goal. A completely word-for-word literal translation would be unreadable. John
<bqverse 15>15 , for example, would be rendered: &quot;Says to him the woman, вЂ
