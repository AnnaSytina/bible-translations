 <a name="fn4" href="amo.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  The Hebrew text repeats, "and in the days of." This phrase has not been repeated in the translation for stylistic reasons.<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="amo.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:1)  This refers to a well-known <i>earthquake</i> that occurred during the first half of the 8th century B.C. Uzziah was a co-regent with his father Amaziah from 792-767 B.C. and ruled independently from 767-740 B.C. Jeroboam II was a co-regent with his father Joash from 793-782 B.C. and ruled independently from 782-753 B.C. Since only Uzziah and Jeroboam are mentioned in the introduction it is likely that Amos's mission to Israel and the earthquake which followed it occurred between 767-753 B.C. The introduction validates the genuine character of Amos's prophetic ministry in at least two ways: (1) Amos was not a native Israelite or a prophet by trade. Rather he was a herdsman in Tekoa, located in Judah. His mere presence in the northern kingdom as a prophet was evidence that he had been called by God (see 7:14-15). (2) The mighty earthquake shortly after Amos's ministry would have been interpreted as an omen or signal of approaching judgment. Amos had prophesied that God's judgment would be accompanied by an earthquake (see 4:13; 8:8; 9:1, 5). When the earthquake occurred, it would verify the truth of his prophecies and indicate that the divine judge was on the march, ready to punish his people.<br>

 <a name="fn7" href="amo.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:2)  The LORD, in his role of warrior-king, is compared to a lion. See 3:4, 8.<br>

 <a name="fn9" href="amo.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  Or "mourn"; "lament," if one stresses the personification. However, the parallel verb ("withers") favors the meaning "wilt away."<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="amo.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:2)  <i>Carmel</i> was a region known for its abundant plants and trees. See Isa 33:9; 35:2; Jer 50:19.<br>
 <a name="fn11" href="amo.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:2)  Loss of a land's fertility is frequently associated with judgment in the OT and ancient Near Eastern literature.<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="amo.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  Traditionally, "transgressions" or "sins." The word refers to rebellion against authority and can be used in the international realm (see 1 Kgs 12:19; 2 Kgs 1:1; 3:5, 7; 8:22). In this context God's mandate to Noah (Gen 9:5-7) is probably in view, at least in the first six oracles against foreign nations. (In the oracles against Judah and Israel violations of the Mosaic Law are in view.) This mandate is viewed as a treaty between God and mankind whereby God holds mankind accountable to populate the earth and respect his image as it is revealed in all men. The atrocities outlined in this and the following oracles can all be viewed as violations of this mandate at an international level.<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="amo.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:3) <i>Heb</i> "Because of three violations of Damascus, even because of four."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:3)  The <i>three...four</i> style introduces each of the judgment oracles of chaps. 1-2. Based on the use of a similar formula in wisdom literature (see Prov 30:18-19, 29-31), one expects to find in each case a list of four specific violations. However, only in the eighth oracle (against Israel) does one find the expected fourfold list. Through this adaptation and alteration of the normal pattern the LORD indicates that his focus is Israel (he is too bent on judging Israel to dwell very long on her neighbors) and he emphasizes Israel's guilt with respect to the other nations. (Israel's list fills up before the others' lists do.) See R. B. Chisholm, "For Three Sins...Even for Four: The Numerical Sayings in Amos," <i>BSac</i> 147 (1990): 188-97.<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="amo.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:3) <i>Heb</i> "I will not bring it [or, "him"] back." The pronominal object (1) refers to the decree of judgment that follows; the referent (the decree) has been specified in the translation for clarity. See S. M. Paul, <i>Amos</i>, 46-47. Another option (2) is to understand the suffix as referring to the particular nation mentioned in the oracle and to translate, "I will not take him [i.e., that particular nation] back." In this case the LORD makes it clear that he does not intend to resume treaty relations with the nation in view. See M. L. Barre, "The Meaning of <FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">l&aacute; &aacute;sOEybnw</FONT> in Amos 1:3-2:6," <i>JBL</i> 105 (1986): 622.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (1:3)  <i>Like threshing boards with iron teeth</i>. A threshing sledge was made of wooden <i>boards</i> embedded with sharp stones or <i>iron teeth</i>. As it was pulled over the threshing floor the stones or iron teeth would separate the grain from the stalks. See O. Borowski, <i>Agriculture in Iron Age Israel</i>, 64-65. Here the threshing metaphor is used to emphasize how violently and inhumanely the Arameans (the people of Damascus) had treated the people of Gilead (located east of the Jordan River).<br>
 <a name="fn16" href="amo.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  "Hazael's house" ("the house of Hazael") refers to the dynasty of Hazael.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (2:6)  On the <i>three...four</i> style that introduces each of the judgment oracles of chaps. 1-2 see the note on the word "four" in 1:3. Only in this last oracle against Israel does one find the list of four specific violations expected based on the use of a similar formula elsewhere in wisdom literature (see Prov 30:18-19, 29-31). This adaptation of the normal pattern indicates the LORD's focus on Israel here (he is too bent on judging Israel to dwell very long on her neighbors) and emphasizes Israel's guilt with respect to the other nations (Israel's list fills up before the others' lists do). See R. B. Chisholm, <i>BSac</i> 147 (1990) 188-97.<br>
 <a name="fn93" href="amo.htm#fnB93"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:6) <i>Heb</i> "I will not bring it [or, "him"] back." The translation understands the pronominal object to refer to the decree of judgment that follows; the referent (the decree) has been specified in the translation for clarity. For another option see the note on the word "judgment" in 1:3.<br>
 <a name="fn94" href="amo.htm#fnB94"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6)  Or "honest." The Hebrew word sometimes has a moral-ethical connotation, "righteous, godly," but the parallelism (note "poor") suggests a socio-economic or legal sense here. The practice of selling debtors as slaves is in view. (See J. A. Dearman, <i>Property Rights in the Eighth-Century Prophets</i>, 19-20.) Probably the only "crime" the victim had committed was being unable to pay back an exorbitant interest rate on a loan.<br>
 <a name="fn95" href="amo.htm#fnB95"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6)  Perhaps the expression "for a pair of sandals" indicates a relatively small price. Some suggest that the sandals may have been an outward token of a more substantial purchase price. Others emend the Hebrew form slightly to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;lun</FONT> ("hidden thing," from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;lu</FONT>, "to hide") and understand this as referring to a bribe.<br>
 <a name="fn96" href="amo.htm#fnB96"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:7)  Most scholars now understand this verb as derived from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[av</FONT> II ("to crush; to trample"), an alternate form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[Wv</FONT>, rather than from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[av</FONT> I ("to pant; to gasp").<br>
 <a name="fn97" href="amo.htm#fnB97"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:7) <i>Heb</i> "those who stomp on the dirt of the ground on the head of the poor." The participial form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ypaVh</FONT> is substantival and stands in apposition to the pronominal suffix on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;rkm</FONT> (v. 6b).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:7)  The picture of the <i>poor</i> having their heads covered with <i>dirt</i> suggests their humiliation before their oppressors and/or their sorrow (see 2 Sam 1:2; 15:32).<br>
 <a name="fn98" href="amo.htm#fnB98"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:7) <i>Heb</i> "they turn aside the way of the destitute." Many interpreters take "way" to mean "just cause" and understand this as a direct reference to the rights of the destitute being ignored. The injustice done to the poor is certainly in view, but the statement is better taken as a word picture depicting the powerful rich pushing the "way of the poor" (i.e., their attempt to be treated justly) to the side. An even more vivid picture is given in Amos 5:12, where the rich are pictured as turning the poor away from the city gate (where legal decisions were made, and therefore where justice should be done).<br>
 <a name="fn99" href="amo.htm#fnB99"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:7) <i>Heb</i> "a man and his father go to a girl." Most interpreters see some type of sexual immorality here, even though the Hebrew phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la ilh</FONT> ("go to") never refers elsewhere to sexual intercourse. (The usual idiom is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la aob</FONT>. However, S. M. Paul, <i>Amos</i>, 82, attempts to develop a linguistic case for a sexual connotation here.) The precise identification of the "girl" in question is not clear. Some see the referent as a cultic prostitute (v. 8 suggests a cultic setting), but the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrun</FONT> nowhere else refers to a prostitute. Because of the contextual emphasis on social oppression, some suggest the exploitation of a slave girl is in view. H. Barstad argues that the "girl" is the hostess at a pagan <i>marzeah </i>banquet (described at some length in 6:4-7). In his view the sin described here is not sexual immorality, but idolatry (see H. Barstad, <i>The Religious Polemics of Amos</i>, 33-36). In this case, one might translate, "Father and son go together to a pagan banquet."<br>

 <a name="fn111" href="amo.htm#fnB111"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:13)  The precise meaning of this verse is unclear. Various suggested meanings have been proposed (see S. M. Paul, <i>Amos</i>, 94): (1) One option is to relate the verb to an Arabic verb, meaning "to hinder; to hamper," and translate, "I am making you immobile, like a cart filled with grain is immobile." In this case, the LORD refers to Israel's inability to escape his coming judgment (see vv. 14-16). (2) Another view relates the verb to a different Arabic verb meaning "to cut in pieces," translating "I will cut you in pieces as a cart cuts in pieces [the earth]," referring to the ruts and rifts in the ground caused by an earthquake. (3) The translation relates the verb to an Arabic root meaning "to groan"; the LORD refers to Israel's sin as weighing him down.<br>

 <a name="fn115" href="amo.htm#fnB115"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:15)  For the idiom of "holding [or, "standing"] one's ground" in battle, there is a similar phrase in Ezek 13:5; also related is the expression "to hold one's own against" (or "to withstand") in Judg 2:14; 2 Kgs 10:4; Dan 8:7 (see S.

 <a name="fn117" href="amo.htm#fnB117"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:1)  Or "about."<br>
 <a name="fn118" href="amo.htm#fnB118"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:1)  One might expect a third person verb form ("he brought up"), since the LORD apparently refers to himself in the third person in the preceding sentence.<br>

If not emended it is usually related to the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qc#M#D~</FONT> and translated as the "Damask linens" of the bed (Cf.

Many emendations have been proposed (e.g., "a part from the foot [of a bed]," based on a different division of the Hebrew letters; "on the edge," based on a Hebrew term not attested in the Bible, cf. NIV "corner"). The most common suggestion is based on resemblance to an Akkadian term which means "sideboard [of a bed]," which is sometimes incorrectly rendered "headboard" (see S. M.

 <a name="fn189" href="amo.htm#fnB189"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:12)  The LORD appears to announce a culminating judgment resulting from Israel's obstinate refusal to repent. The following verse describes the LORD in his role as sovereign judge, but it does not outline the judgment per se. For this reason Andersen and Freedman (<i>Amos</i>, 450) take the prefixed verbal forms as preterites referring to the series of judgments detailed in vv. 6-11. It is more likely that a coming judgment is in view, but that its details are omitted for rhetorical effect, creating a degree of suspense (see S. M. Paul, <i>Amos</i>, 149-50).<br>

If the suffix refers to the following term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;da</FONT> ("men"), then the expression refers to God's ability to read men's minds.<br>
 <a name="fn193" href="amo.htm#fnB193"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn </b> (4:13) <i>Heb</i> "he who makes dawn, darkness." The meaning of the statement is unclear. The present translation assumes that allusion is made to God's approaching judgment, when the light of day will be turned to darkness (see 5:20). Other options include: (1) "He makes the dawn [and] the darkness." A few Hebrew MSS, as well as the LXX, add the conjunction ("and") between the two nouns. (2) "He turns darkness into glimmering dawn." See S. M. Paul, <i>Amos</i>, 154, who takes <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rjv</FONT> as "blackness" rather than "dawn" and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hpyu</FONT> as "glimmering dawn" rather than "darkness."<br>

 <b>sn</b> (5:4)  The following verses explain what it meant to <i>long for</i> the LORD.

 <a name="fn209" href="amo.htm#fnB209"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:5)  In the Hebrew text the statement is emphasized by soundplay.

The repetition of the "g" and "l" sounds draws attention to the announcement and suggests that Gilgal's destiny is inherent in its very name.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (5:5)  That the people of <i>Gilgal</i> would be taken into exile is ironic, for Gilgal was Israel's first campsite when the people entered the land under Joshua and the city became a symbol of Israel's possession of the promised land.<br>

This logical connector relates back to the accusation of vv. 10-13, not to the parenthetical call to repentance in vv. 14-15.

 <a name="fn249" href="amo.htm#fnB249"><sup>55</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:17)  The expression <i>pass through your midst</i> alludes to Exod 12:12, where the LORD announced he would "pass through" Egypt and bring death to the Egyptian firstborn.<br>
 <a name="fn250" href="amo.htm#fnB250"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn </b> (5:18) <i>Heb</i> "the day of the LORD" (twice in this verse). The origin of the concept of the LORD's day of judgment is uncertain. Perhaps it originated in the ancient Near Eastern idea of the sovereign's day of conquest, where a king would boast that he had concluded an entire military campaign in a single day (see D. Stuart, "The Sovereign's Day of Conquest," <i>BASOR</i> 221 [1976]: 159-64). In the OT the expression is applied to several acts of divine judgment, some historical and others still future (see A. J.

In the OT the phrase first appears in Amos (assuming that Amos predates Joel and Obadiah), where it seems to refer to a belief in the northern kingdom that God would intervene on Israel's behalf and judge the nation's enemies.

The point seems to be this: Since sacrifices did not characterize God's relationship with Israel during the nation's formative years, the people should not consider them to be so fundamental. The LORD places a higher priority on justice than he does on empty ritual.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (5:25)  Like Jer 7:22-23, this passage seems to contradict the Pentateuchal accounts that indicate Israel did offer sacrifices during the wilderness period. It is likely that both Amos and Jeremiah overstate the case to emphasize the relative insignificance of sacrifices in comparison to weightier matters of the covenant.

The translation understands v. 2 as the boastful words which the leaders (described in v. 1) spoke to those who came to them (v. 1b). Some interpret v. 2 differently, understanding the words as directed <i>to</i> the leaders by the prophet. Verse 2b would then be translated: "Are<b> </b><i>you</i> (i.e., Israel and Judah) better than these kingdoms (i.e., Calneh, etc.)? Is your border larger than their border?" (This reading requires an emendation of the Hebrew text toward the end of the verse.) In this case the verse is a reminder to Judah/Israel that they are <i>not</i> superior to other nations, which have already fallen victim to military conquest. Consequently Judah/Israel should not expect to escape the same fate. Following this line of interpretation, some take v. 2 as a later addition since the Assyrians under Tiglath-pileser III conquered Calneh, Hamath, and Gath after the time of Amos's ministry.

 <a name="fn317" href="amo.htm#fnB317"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:7)  The Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ina</FONT> ("tin") occurs only in this passage (twice in this verse and twice in the following verse). (Its proposed meaning is based on an Akkadian cognate <i>annaku</i>.) The tin wall of the vision, if it symbolizes Israel, may suggest weakness and vulnerability to judgment. See S. M. Paul, <i>Amos</i>, 233-35. The symbolic significance of God holding tin in his hand and then placing tin among the people is unclear. Possibly the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ina</FONT> in v. 8b is a homonym meaning "grief" (this term is attested in post-biblical Hebrew). In this case there is a word play, the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ina</FONT> ("tin") of the vision suggesting the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ina</FONT> ("grief") that judgment will bring upon the land. See Andersen and Freedman, <i>Amos</i>, 759. The traditional interpretation of these verses (reflected in many modern translations) understands the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ina</FONT> to mean "lead," and by extension, "plumb line." In this case, one may translate: "I saw the sovereign one standing by a wall built true to plumb holding a plumb line in his hand. The LORD said to me, `What do you see, Amos?' I said, `A plumb line.' The sovereign one then said, `Look, I am about to place a plumb line among my people...'" According to this view, the plumb line symbolizes God's moral standards by which he will measure Israel to see if they are a straight or crooked wall.<br>

 <a name="fn388" href="amo.htm#fnB388"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:14) <i>Heb</i> "the sin [or, "guilt"] of Samaria." This is probably a derogatory reference to an idol-goddess popular in the northern kingdom, perhaps Asherah. Some translations (cf. NEB, NRSV) repoint the word and read "Ashimah," the name of a goddess worshiped in Hamath in Syria (see 2 Kgs 17:30).<br>
 <a name="fn389" href="amo.htm#fnB389"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:14) <i>Heb</i> "say."<br>
 <a name="fn390" href="amo.htm#fnB390"><sup>49</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:14)  <i>Your god</i> may refer to the golden calf image erected in Dan by Jeroboam I. See 1 Kgs 12:28-30.<br>
 <a name="fn391" href="amo.htm#fnB391"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tc</b> (8:14)  The MT reads, "As surely as the way [to] Beersheba lives," or "As surely as the way lives, O Beersheba." Perhaps the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">irD</FONT> ("the way") refers to the pilgrimage route to Beersheba (see S. M. Paul, <i>Amos</i>, 272) or it may be a title for a god. The translation above assumes an emendation to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">idD</FONT> ("your beloved") and understands this as referring to a deity that was particularly popular in Beersheba.<br>
 <a name="fn392" href="amo.htm#fnB392"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:1)  Or "the Lord." The Hebrew term translated "Sovereign One" here is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn&#180;d)a&amp;</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a&amp;d{n&#180;y</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn393" href="amo.htm#fnB393"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:1)  The <i>altar</i> is perhaps the altar at Bethel.<br>
 <a name="fn394" href="amo.htm#fnB394"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:1)  Or "the capitals." The Hebrew singular form is collective.<br>
 <a name="fn395" href="amo.htm#fnB395"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:1) <i>Heb</i> "cut them off on the head of all of them." The translation assumes the objective suffix on the verb refers to the tops of the pillars and that the following prepositional phrase refers to the people standing beneath. Another option is to take this phrase as referring to the pillars, in which case one could translate, "Knock all the tops of the pillars off."<br>
 <a name="fn396" href="amo.htm#fnB396"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:1) <i>Heb</i> "the remnant of them." One could possibly translate, "every last one of them" (cf. NEB "to the last man"). This probably refers to those who survive the collapse of the temple, which may symbolize the northern kingdom.<br>
 <a name="fn397" href="amo.htm#fnB397"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:1) <i>Heb</i> "a fugitive belonging to them will not run away."<br>
 <a name="fn398" href="amo.htm#fnB398"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:1) <i>Heb</i> "a survivor belonging to them will not escape."<br>
 <a name="fn399" href="amo.htm#fnB399"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:2) <i>Heb</i> "into Sheol," the land of the dead localized in Hebrew thought in the earth's core.<br>
 <a name="fn400" href="amo.htm#fnB400"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:3) <i>Heb</i> "from before my eyes."<br>
 <a name="fn401" href="amo.htm#fnB401"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:3)  Or perhaps simply, "there," if the <i>mem</i> prefixed to the adverb is dittographic (note the preceding word ends in <i>mem</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn402" href="amo.htm#fnB402"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:3)  If the article indicates a definite serpent, then the mythological <i>Sea Serpent</i>, symbolic of the world's chaotic forces, is probably in view. See Job 26:13 and Isa 27:1 (where it is also called Leviathan). Elsewhere in the OT this serpent is depicted as opposing the LORD, but this text implies that even this powerful enemy of God is ultimately subject to his sovereign will.<br>
 <a name="fn403" href="amo.htm#fnB403"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:4) <i>Heb</i> "Even if they go into captivity before their enemies."<br>
 <a name="fn404" href="amo.htm#fnB404"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:4)  Or perhaps simply, "there," if the <i>mem</i> prefixed to the adverb is dittographic (note the preceding word ends in <i>mem</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn405" href="amo.htm#fnB405"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:4) <i>Heb</i> "I will set my eye on them for disaster, not good."<br>
 <a name="fn406" href="amo.htm#fnB406"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:5)  The words "will do this" are supplied in the translation for clarification.<br>
 <a name="fn407" href="amo.htm#fnB407"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:5)  Or "melts." The verb probably depicts earthquakes and landslides. See v. 5b.<br>
 <a name="fn408" href="amo.htm#fnB408"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:5) <i>Heb</i> "all of it."<br>
 <a name="fn409" href="amo.htm#fnB409"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:5)  <i>Heb</i> "the Nile." The word "River" is supplied in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn410" href="amo.htm#fnB410"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:5)  Or "sinks back down."<br>
 <a name="fn411" href="amo.htm#fnB411"><sup>20</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:5)  See Amos 8:8, which is very similar to this verse.<br>
 <a name="fn412" href="amo.htm#fnB412"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tc</b> (9:6)  The MT reads "his steps." The prefixed <i>mem</i> may be dittographic (note the preceding word ends in <i>mem</i>). The translation assumes an emendation to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">otylu</FONT> ("his upper rooms").<br>
 <a name="fn413" href="amo.htm#fnB413"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:6)  Traditionally, "vault." The precise meaning of this word in this context is unclear. Elsewhere it refers to objects grouped or held together. Andersen and Freedman (<i>Amos</i>, 845-46) suggest the foundational structure of a building is in view.<br>
 <a name="fn414" href="amo.htm#fnB414"><sup>23</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:6)  Verse 6a pictures the entire universe as a divine palace founded <i>on the earth</i> and extending into the heavens.<br>
 <a name="fn415" href="amo.htm#fnB415"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:7)  The Hebrew text has a rhetorical question, "Are you children of Israel not like the Cushites to me?" The rhetorical question has been converted to an affirmative statement in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (9:7)  Though Israel was God's special covenant people (see 3:2a), the Lord emphasizes they are not inherently superior to the other nations subject to his sovereign rule.<br>
 <a name="fn416" href="amo.htm#fnB416"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:7)  <i>Caphtor </i>perhaps refers to the island of Crete.<br>
 <a name="fn417" href="amo.htm#fnB417"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:7)  The second half of v. 7 is also phrased as a rhetorical question in the Hebrew text, "Did I not bring Israel up from the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and Aram from Kir?" The translation converts the rhetorical question into an affirmation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn418" href="amo.htm#fnB418"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:8) <i>Heb</i> "the eyes of the sovereign LORD are on."<br>
 <a name="fn419" href="amo.htm#fnB419"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:8)  Or "kingdom."<br>
 <a name="fn420" href="amo.htm#fnB420"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:8) <i>Heb</i> "house" (also in the following verse).<br>
 <a name="fn421" href="amo.htm#fnB421"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:9) <i>Heb</i> "like being shaken with a sieve, and a pebble does not fall to the ground." The meaning of the Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rorx</FONT>, translated "pebble," is unclear here. In 2 Sam 17:13 it appears to refer to a stone. If it means "pebble," then the sieve described in v. 6 allows the grain to fall into a basket while retaining the debris and pebbles. However, if one interprets <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rorx</FONT> as a "kernel of grain" (cf. NASB, NIV) then the sieve is constructed to retain the grain and allow the refuse and pebbles to fall to the ground. In either case, the simile supports the last statement in v. 8 by making it clear that God will distinguish between the righteous (the grain) and the wicked (the pebbles) when he judges, and will thereby preserve a remnant in Israel. Only the sinners will be destroyed (v. 10).<br>
 <a name="fn422" href="amo.htm#fnB422"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:11)  The phrase translated "collapsing hut" refers to a temporary shelter (cf. NRSV "booth") in disrepair and emphasizes the relatively weakened condition of the once powerful Davidic dynasty.<br>
 <a name="fn423" href="amo.htm#fnB423"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tc</b> (9:11)  The MT reads a third feminine plural suffix, but this should be emended to third feminine singular, since the "hut" of the preceding line (a feminine singular noun) appears to be the antecedent. The final <i>nun</i> is virtually dittographic with the <i>vav</i> that appears at the beginning of the following word.<br>
 <a name="fn424" href="amo.htm#fnB424"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tc</b> (9:11)  The MT reads a third masculine singular suffix, which could refer back to David. However, it is more likely that an original third feminine singular suffix (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hy</FONT>-) has been misread as masculine (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wy</FONT>-). In later Hebrew script a <i>he</i> resembles a <i>yod-vav</i> combination.<br>
 <a name="fn425" href="amo.htm#fnB425"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:11) <i>Heb</i> "and I will rebuild as in days of antiquity."<br>
 <a name="fn426" href="amo.htm#fnB426"><sup>35</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:12)  <i>They</i> probably refers to the Israelites or to the Davidic rulers of the future.<br>
 <a name="fn427" href="amo.htm#fnB427"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:12) <i>Heb</i> "take possession of the remnant of Edom."<br>
 <a name="fn428" href="amo.htm#fnB428"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:12) <i>Heb</i> "nations over whom my name is proclaimed." The Hebrew idiom indicates ownership, sometimes as a result of conquest. See 2 Sam 12:28.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (9:12)  This verse envisions a new era of Israelite conquest, patterned after David's imperialistic successes. See 2 Sam 8-10.<br>
 <a name="fn429" href="amo.htm#fnB429"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:13)  Or "look."<br>
 <a name="fn430" href="amo.htm#fnB430"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:13) <i>Heb</i> "the days are."<br>
 <a name="fn431" href="amo.htm#fnB431"><sup>40</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:13)  <i>The plowman will catch up to the reaper</i>. Plowing occurred in October-November, and harvesting in April-May (see P. King, <i>Amos</i>, 109.) But in the future age of restored divine blessing, there will be so many crops the reapers will take all summer to harvest them, and it will be time for plowing again before the harvest is finished.<br>
 <a name="fn432" href="amo.htm#fnB432"><sup>41</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:13)  When the grapes had been harvested, they were placed in a press where workers would stomp on them with their feet and squeeze out the juice. For a discussion of grape harvesting technique, see O. Borowski, <i>Agriculture in Iron Age Israel</i>, 110-12.<br>
 <a name="fn433" href="amo.htm#fnB433"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:13)  The verb is omitted here in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied in the translation from the parallel line.<br>
 <a name="fn434" href="amo.htm#fnB434"><sup>43</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:13)  The grape harvest occurred in August-September, planting in November-December (see P. King, <i>Amos</i>, 109). But in the future age described here there will be so many grapes the workers who stomp them will still be working when the next planting season arrives.<br>
 <a name="fn435" href="amo.htm#fnB435"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:13)  Or "hills," where the vineyards were planted.<br>
 <a name="fn436" href="amo.htm#fnB436"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:13) <i>Heb</i> "and all the hills will melt."<br>
 <a name="fn437" href="amo.htm#fnB437"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:14)  Or "the ruined [or, "desolate"] cities."<br>
 <a name="fn438" href="amo.htm#fnB438"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:14)  Or "and live [in them]."<br>
 <a name="fn439" href="amo.htm#fnB439"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:14) <i>Heb</i> "drink their wine."<br>
 <a name="fn440" href="amo.htm#fnB440"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:14)  Or "gardens."<br>
 <a name="fn441" href="amo.htm#fnB441"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:14) <i>Heb</i> "eat their fruit."<br>
 <a name="fn442" href="amo.htm#fnB442"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:15) <i>Heb</i> "their." The pronoun was replaced by the English definite article in the translation for stylistic reasons.
