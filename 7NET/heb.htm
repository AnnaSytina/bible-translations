<a name="_Toc494013775"></a><p><i>Introduction: God Has Spoken Fully and Finally in His Son</i>
<p><A NAME="1"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> After God spoke long ago<a name="fnB0" href="heb_note.htm#fn0"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> in various portions<a name="fnB1" href="heb_note.htm#fn1"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> and in various ways<a name="fnB2" href="heb_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> to our ancestors<a name="fnB3" href="heb_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> through the prophets, 
<bqverse 2>2  in these last days he has spoken to us in a son,<a name="fnB4" href="heb_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he created the world.<a name="fnB5" href="heb_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  The Son is<a name="fnB6" href="heb_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> the radiance of his glory and the representation of his essence, and he sustains all things by his powerful word,<a name="fnB7" href="heb_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> and so when he had accomplished cleansing for sins, <i>he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high</i>.<a name="fnB8" href="heb_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  Thus he became<a name="fnB9" href="heb_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> so far better than the angels as<a name="fnB10" href="heb_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> he has inherited a name superior to theirs.<a name="_Toc403221985"></a><a name="_Toc416894475"></a><a name="_Toc432265338"></a><a name="_Toc485060279"></a><a name="_Toc494013776"></a></p>
<p><i>The Son Is Superior to Angels</i>
<p>
<bqverse 5>5  For to which of the angels did God<a name="fnB11" href="heb_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> ever say, "<b><i>You are my son! Today I have fathered you</i></b>"?<a name="fnB12" href="heb_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> And in another place<a name="fnB13" href="heb_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> he says,<a name="fnB14" href="heb_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> "<b><i>I will be his father and he will be my son</i></b>."<a name="fnB15" href="heb_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  But when he again brings<a name="fnB16" href="heb_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> his firstborn into the world, he says, "<b><i>Let all the angels of God worship him!</i></b>"<a name="fnB17" href="heb_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  And he says<a name="fnB18" href="heb_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> of the angels, "<b><i>He makes</i></b><a name="fnB19" href="heb_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> <b><i>his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire</i></b>,"<a name="fnB20" href="heb_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  but of<a name="fnB21" href="heb_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> the Son he says,<a name="fnB22" href="heb_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a></p>
<br><b><i>"<b><i>Your throne</i></b><i>,<b> O God</b></i>,<b><i> is forever and ever</i></b><i>,</i><a name="fnB23" href="heb_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a><br>
and a righteous scepter<a name="fnB24" href="heb_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> is the scepter of your kingdom. <br>
<bqverse 9>9 You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness.<br>
So God, your God, has anointed you over your companions<a name="fnB25" href="heb_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> with the oil of rejoicing."<a name="fnB26" href="heb_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> </i></b></ul><p>
<bqverse 10>10  And, </p>
<br><b><i>"<b><i>You founded the earth in the beginning</i></b><i>,<b> Lord</b>,</i><a name="fnB27" href="heb_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> </i></b><br>
<b><i>and the heavens are the works of your hands</i></b><i>.<b> </b></i><br>
<bqverse 11>11 <b><i>They will perish, but you continue</i></b><i>.<b> </b></i><br>

<bqverse 13>13  But to which of the angels<a name="fnB29" href="heb_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> has he ever said, "<b><i>Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet</i></b>"?<a name="fnB30" href="heb_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to serve those<a name="fnB31" href="heb_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> who will inherit salvation?

<p><i>Warning Against Drifting Away</i>
<p><A NAME="2"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Therefore we must pay closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away. 
<bqverse 2>2  For if the message spoken through angels<a name="fnB32" href="heb_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> proved to be so firm that every violation<a name="fnB33" href="heb_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> or disobedience received its just penalty, 
<bqverse 3>3  how will we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was first communicated through the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him, 
<bqverse 4>4  while God confirmed their witness<a name="fnB34" href="heb_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> with signs and wonders and various miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed<a name="fnB35" href="heb_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> according to his will.<a name="_Toc403221987"></a><a name="_Toc416894477"></a><a name="_Toc432265340"></a><a name="_Toc485060281"></a><a name="_Toc494013778"></a></p>
<p><i>Exposition of Psalm 8: <br>Jesus and the Destiny of Humanity</i>
<p>
<bqverse 5>5  For he did not put the world to come,<a name="fnB36" href="heb_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> about which we are speaking,<a name="fnB37" href="heb_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> under the control of angels. 
<bqverse 6>6  Instead someone testified somewhere:<a name="fnB38" href="heb_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> </p>
<br><b><i>"<b><i>What is man that you think of him</i></b><a name="fnB39" href="heb_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> or the son of man that you care for him?</i></b><br>
<bqverse 7>7 "<b><i>You made him lower than the angels for a little while</i></b><i>.<b> </b></i><br>
<b><i>You crowned him with glory and honor</i></b><i>.</i><br>
<bqverse 8>8 "<b><i>You put all things under his control</i></b><i>.</i>"<a name="fnB40" href="heb_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a></i></b></ul><p>For when he <b><i>put all things under his control</i></b>, he left nothing outside of his control. At present we do not yet see <b><i>all things under his control</i></b>,<a name="fnB41" href="heb_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  but we see Jesus, who was made <b><i>lower than the angels for a little while</i></b>,<a name="fnB42" href="heb_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death,<a name="fnB43" href="heb_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> so that by God's grace he would experience death on behalf of everyone. 
<bqverse 10>10  For it was fitting for him, for whom and through whom all things exist,<a name="fnB44" href="heb_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> in bringing many sons to glory, to make the pioneer<a name="fnB45" href="heb_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> of their salvation perfect through sufferings. 
<bqverse 11>11  For indeed he who makes holy and those being made holy all have the same origin,<a name="fnB46" href="heb_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> and so<a name="fnB47" href="heb_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> he is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB48" href="heb_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  saying, "<b><i>I will proclaim your name to my brothers;</i></b><a name="fnB49" href="heb_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> in the midst of the assembly I will praise you</i></b>."<a name="fnB50" href="heb_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  Again he says,<a name="fnB51" href="heb_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> "I will be confident in him," and again, "<b><i>Here I am</i></b><i>,</i><a name="fnB52" href="heb_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> <b><i>with</i></b><a name="fnB53" href="heb_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> <b><i>the children God has given me</i></b>."<a name="fnB54" href="heb_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, he likewise shared in<a name="fnB55" href="heb_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> their humanity,<a name="fnB56" href="heb_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> so that through death he could destroy<a name="fnB57" href="heb_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> the one who holds the power of death (that is, the devil), 
<bqverse 15>15  and set free those who were held in slavery all their lives by their fear of death. 
<bqverse 16>16  For surely his concern is not for angels, but he is concerned for Abraham's descendants. 
<bqverse 17>17  Therefore he had<a name="fnB58" href="heb_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> to be made like his brothers and sisters<a name="fnB59" href="heb_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> in every respect, so that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make atonement<a name="fnB60" href="heb_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> for the sins of the people. 
<bqverse 18>18  For since he suffered and was tempted,<a name="fnB61" href="heb_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> he is able to help those who are tempted.

<p><i>Jesus and Moses</i>
<p><A NAME="3"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Therefore, holy brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB62" href="heb_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> partners in a heavenly calling, take note of Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess,<a name="fnB63" href="heb_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  who is faithful to the one who appointed him, as Moses was also in God's<a name="fnB64" href="heb_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> house.<a name="fnB65" href="heb_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  For he has come to deserve greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house deserves greater honor than the house itself! 
<bqverse 4>4  For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God. 
<bqverse 5>5  Now Moses was <b><i>faithful in all God's</i></b><a name="fnB66" href="heb_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> <b><i>house</i></b><a name="fnB67" href="heb_note.htm#fn67"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> as a servant, to testify to the things that would be spoken. 
<bqverse 6>6  But Christ<a name="fnB68" href="heb_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> is faithful as a son over God's<a name="fnB69" href="heb_note.htm#fn69"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> house. We are of his house,<a name="fnB70" href="heb_note.htm#fn70"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> if in fact we hold firmly<a name="fnB71" href="heb_note.htm#fn71"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> to our confidence and the hope we take pride in.<a name="fnB72" href="heb_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc403221989"></a><a name="_Toc416894479"></a><a name="_Toc432265342"></a><a name="_Toc485060283"></a><a name="_Toc494013780"></a></p>
<p><i>Exposition of Psalm 95: Hearing God's Word in Faith</i>
<p>
<bqverse 7>7  Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says,<a name="fnB73" href="heb_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a></p>
<br><b><i>"<b><i>Oh</i></b><i>,<b> that today you would listen as he speaks!</b></i><a name="fnB74" href="heb_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a><br>
<bqverse 8>8 "<b><i>Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion</i></b><i>,<b> in the day of testing in the wilderness</b>.</i><br>
<bqverse 9>9 "<b><i>There your fathers tested me and tried me</i></b><i>,</i><a name="fnB75" href="heb_note.htm#fn75"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> and they saw my works for forty years</i></b><i>.</i><br>
<bqverse 10>10 <b><i> </i></b>"<b><i>Therefore</i></b><i>,<b> I became provoked at that generation and said</b>,<b> </b></i>`<b><i>Their hearts are always wandering</i></b><a name="fnB76" href="heb_note.htm#fn76"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> and they have not known my ways</i></b><i>.</i>'<br>
<bqverse 11>11 "<b><i>As I swore in my anger</i></b><i>,<b> </b></i>`<b><i>They will never enter my rest!</i></b>'"<a name="fnB77" href="heb_note.htm#fn77"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a></i></b></ul><p>
<bqverse 12>12  See to it,<a name="fnB78" href="heb_note.htm#fn78"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB79" href="heb_note.htm#fn79"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> that none of you has<a name="fnB80" href="heb_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> an evil, unbelieving heart that forsakes<a name="fnB81" href="heb_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> the living God.<a name="fnB82" href="heb_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  But exhort one another each day, as long as it is called "Today," that none of you may become hardened by sin's deception. 
<bqverse 14>14  For we have become partners with Christ, if in fact we hold our initial confidence<a name="fnB83" href="heb_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> firm until the end. 
<bqverse 15>15  As it says,<a name="fnB84" href="heb_note.htm#fn84"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> "<b><i>Oh</i></b><i>,<b> that today you would listen as he speaks!</b></i><a name="fnB85" href="heb_note.htm#fn85"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> <b><i>Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion</i></b>."<a name="fnB86" href="heb_note.htm#fn86"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  For which ones heard and rebelled? Was it not all who came out of Egypt under Moses' leadership?<a name="fnB87" href="heb_note.htm#fn87"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  And against whom was God<a name="fnB88" href="heb_note.htm#fn88"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> provoked for forty years? Was it not those who sinned, <i>whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness</i>?<a name="fnB89" href="heb_note.htm#fn89"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  And to whom did he swear they would never enter into his rest, except those who were disobedient? 
<bqverse 19>19  So<a name="fnB90" href="heb_note.htm#fn90"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> we see that they could not enter because of unbelief.
<bqchapter 4>
<a name="_Toc403221990"></a><a name="_Toc416894480"></a><a name="_Toc432265343"></a><a name="_Toc485060284"></a><a name="_Toc494013781"></a></p>
<p><i>God's Promised Rest</i>
<p><A NAME="4"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Therefore we must be wary<a name="fnB91" href="heb_note.htm#fn91"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> that, while the promise of entering his rest remains open, none of you may seem to have come short of it. 
<bqverse 2>2  For we had good news proclaimed to us just as they did. But the message they heard did them no good, since they did not join in<a name="fnB92" href="heb_note.htm#fn92"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> with those who heard it in faith.<a name="fnB93" href="heb_note.htm#fn93"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, "<b><i>As I swore in my anger</i></b><i>,<b> </b></i>`<b><i>They will never enter my rest!</i></b>'"<a name="fnB94" href="heb_note.htm#fn94"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> And yet God's works<a name="fnB95" href="heb_note.htm#fn95"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> were accomplished from the foundation of the world. 
<bqverse 4>4  For he has spoken somewhere about the seventh day in this way: "<b><i>And God rested on the seventh day from all his works</i></b>,"<a name="fnB96" href="heb_note.htm#fn96"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  but to repeat the text cited earlier:<a name="fnB97" href="heb_note.htm#fn97"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> "<b><i>They will never enter my rest!</i></b>" 
<bqverse 6>6  Therefore it remains for some to enter it, yet those to whom it was previously proclaimed did not enter because of disobedience. 
<bqverse 7>7  So God<a name="fnB98" href="heb_note.htm#fn98"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> again ordains a certain day, "Today," speaking through David<a name="fnB99" href="heb_note.htm#fn99"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> after so long a time, as in the words quoted before,<a name="fnB100" href="heb_note.htm#fn100"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> "<b><i>O</i></b><i>,<b> that today you would listen as he speaks!</b></i><a name="fnB101" href="heb_note.htm#fn101"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> Do not harden your hearts</i></b>." 
<bqverse 8>8  For if Joshua had given them rest, God<a name="fnB102" href="heb_note.htm#fn102"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> would not have spoken afterwards about another day. 
<bqverse 9>9  Consequently a Sabbath rest remains for the people of God. 
<bqverse 10>10  For the one who enters God's<a name="fnB103" href="heb_note.htm#fn103"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> rest has also rested from his works, just as God did from his own works. 
<bqverse 11>11  Thus we must make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by following the same pattern of disobedience. 
<bqverse 12>12  For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing even to the point of dividing soul from spirit, and joints from marrow; it is able to judge the desires and thoughts of the heart. 
<bqverse 13>13  And no creature is hidden from God,<a name="fnB104" href="heb_note.htm#fn104"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> but everything is naked and exposed to his eyes to whom we must render an account.<a name="_Toc403221991"></a><a name="_Toc416894481"></a><a name="_Toc432265344"></a><a name="_Toc485060285"></a><a name="_Toc494013782"></a></p>
<p><i>Jesus Our Compassionate High Priest</i>
<p>
<bqverse 14>14  Therefore since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession. 
<bqverse 15>15  For we do not have a high priest incapable of sympathizing with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in every way just as we are, yet without sin. 
<bqverse 16>16  Therefore let us confidently approach the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace whenever we need help.<a name="fnB105" href="heb_note.htm#fn105"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqchapter 5><A NAME="5"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> For every high priest is taken from among people<a name="fnB106" href="heb_note.htm#fn106"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> and appointed<a name="fnB107" href="heb_note.htm#fn107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> to represent them before God,<a name="fnB108" href="heb_note.htm#fn108"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins. 
<bqverse 2>2  He is able to deal compassionately with those who are ignorant and erring, since he also is subject to weakness, 
<bqverse 3>3  and for this reason he is obligated to make sin-offerings for himself as well as for the people. 
<bqverse 4>4  And no one assumes this honor<a name="fnB109" href="heb_note.htm#fn109"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> on his own initiative,<a name="fnB110" href="heb_note.htm#fn110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> but only when called to it by God,<a name="fnB111" href="heb_note.htm#fn111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> as in fact Aaron was. 
<bqverse 5>5  So also Christ did not glorify himself in becoming high priest, but the one who glorified him was God,<a name="fnB112" href="heb_note.htm#fn112"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> who said to him, "<b><i>You are my Son! Today I have fathered you</i></b>,"<a name="fnB113" href="heb_note.htm#fn113"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  as also in another place God<a name="fnB114" href="heb_note.htm#fn114"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> says, "<b><i>You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek</i></b>."<a name="fnB115" href="heb_note.htm#fn115"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  During his earthly life<a name="fnB116" href="heb_note.htm#fn116"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> Christ<a name="fnB117" href="heb_note.htm#fn117"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> offered<a name="fnB118" href="heb_note.htm#fn118"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> both requests and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death and he was heard because of his devotion. 
<bqverse 8>8  Although he was a son, he learned obedience through the things he suffered.<a name="fnB119" href="heb_note.htm#fn119"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  And by being perfected in this way, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him, 
<bqverse 10>10  and he was designated<a name="fnB120" href="heb_note.htm#fn120"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> by God as high priest <b><i>in the order of Melchizedek</i></b>.<a name="fnB121" href="heb_note.htm#fn121"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc403221992"></a><a name="_Toc416894482"></a><a name="_Toc432265345"></a><a name="_Toc485060286"></a><a name="_Toc494013783"></a></p>
<p><i>The Need to Move on to Maturity</i>
<p>
<bqverse 11>11  On this topic we have much to say<a name="fnB122" href="heb_note.htm#fn122"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> and it is difficult to explain, since you have become sluggish<a name="fnB123" href="heb_note.htm#fn123"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> in hearing. 
<bqverse 12>12  For though you should in fact be teachers by this time,<a name="fnB124" href="heb_note.htm#fn124"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> you need someone to teach you the beginning elements of God's utterances.<a name="fnB125" href="heb_note.htm#fn125"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> You have gone back to needing<a name="fnB126" href="heb_note.htm#fn126"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> milk, not solid food. 
<bqverse 13>13  For everyone who lives on milk is inexperienced in the message of righteousness, because he is an infant. 
<bqverse 14>14  But solid food is for the mature, whose perceptions are trained by practice to discern both good and evil.<p>

<bqchapter 6><A NAME="6"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Therefore we must progress beyond<a name="fnB127" href="heb_note.htm#fn127"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> the elementary<a name="fnB128" href="heb_note.htm#fn128"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> instructions about Christ<a name="fnB129" href="heb_note.htm#fn129"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> and move on<a name="fnB130" href="heb_note.htm#fn130"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> to maturity, not laying this foundation again: repentance from dead works and faith in God, 
<bqverse 2>2  teaching about baptisms, laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. 
<bqverse 3>3  And this is what we intend to do,<a name="fnB131" href="heb_note.htm#fn131"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> if God permits. 
<bqverse 4>4  For it is impossible in the case of those who have once been enlightened, tasted the heavenly gift, become partakers of the Holy Spirit, 
<bqverse 5>5  tasted the good word of God and the miracles of the coming age, 
<bqverse 6>6  and then have committed apostasy,<a name="fnB132" href="heb_note.htm#fn132"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> to renew them again to repentance, since<a name="fnB133" href="heb_note.htm#fn133"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> they are crucifying the Son of God for themselves all over again<a name="fnB134" href="heb_note.htm#fn134"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> and holding him up to contempt. 
<bqverse 7>7  For the ground that has soaked up the rain that frequently falls on<a name="fnB135" href="heb_note.htm#fn135"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> it and yields useful vegetation for those who tend it receives a blessing from God. 
<bqverse 8>8  But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is useless and about to be cursed;<a name="fnB136" href="heb_note.htm#fn136"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> its fate is to be burned. 
<bqverse 9>9  But in your case, dear friends, even though we speak like this, we are convinced of better things relating to salvation. 
<bqverse 10>10  For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love you have demonstrated for his name, in having served and continuing to serve the saints. 
<bqverse 11>11  But we passionately want each of you to demonstrate the same eagerness for the fulfillment of your hope until the end, 
<bqverse 12>12  so that you may not be sluggish,<a name="fnB137" href="heb_note.htm#fn137"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> but imitators of those who through faith and perseverance inherit the promises.<p>

<bqverse 13>13  Now when God made his promise to Abraham, since he could swear by no one greater, he swore by himself, 
<bqverse 14>14  saying, "<b><i>Surely I will bless you greatly and multiply your descendants abundantly</i></b>."<a name="fnB138" href="heb_note.htm#fn138"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  And so by persevering, Abraham<a name="fnB139" href="heb_note.htm#fn139"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> inherited the promise. 
<bqverse 16>16  For people swear by something greater than themselves,<a name="fnB140" href="heb_note.htm#fn140"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> and the oath serves as a confirmation to end all dispute.<a name="fnB141" href="heb_note.htm#fn141"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  In the same way<a name="fnB142" href="heb_note.htm#fn142"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> God wanted to demonstrate more clearly to the heirs of the promise that his purpose was unchangeable,<a name="fnB143" href="heb_note.htm#fn143"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> and so he intervened with an oath, 
<bqverse 18>18  so that we who have found refuge in him<a name="fnB144" href="heb_note.htm#fn144"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> may find strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us through two unchangeable things, since it is impossible for God to lie. 
<bqverse 19>19  We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, sure and steadfast, which reaches inside behind the curtain,<a name="fnB145" href="heb_note.htm#fn145"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  where Jesus our forerunner entered on our behalf, since he became <b><i>a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek</i></b>.<a name="fnB146" href="heb_note.htm#fn146"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>The Nature of Jesus' Melchizedekan Priesthood</i>
<p><A NAME="7"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Now this <b><i>Melchizedek</i></b>, <b><i>king of Salem</i></b>, <b><i>priest of the most high God</i></b>, <b><i>met Abraham as he was returning from defeating the kings</i></b> and <b><i>blessed him</i></b>.<a name="fnB147" href="heb_note.htm#fn147"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  To him<a name="fnB148" href="heb_note.htm#fn148"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> also <b><i>Abraham apportioned a tithe</i></b><a name="fnB149" href="heb_note.htm#fn149"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> of everything</i></b>.<a name="fnB150" href="heb_note.htm#fn150"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> His name first means<a name="fnB151" href="heb_note.htm#fn151"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> king of righteousness, then <b><i>king of Salem</i></b>, that is, king of peace. 
<bqverse 3>3  Without father, without mother, without genealogy, he has neither beginning of days nor end of life but is like the son of God, and he remains a priest for all time. 
<bqverse 4>4  But see how great he must be, if<a name="fnB152" href="heb_note.htm#fn152"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> Abraham the patriarch gave him a tithe<a name="fnB153" href="heb_note.htm#fn153"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> of his finest plunder. 
<bqverse 5>5  And those of the sons of Levi who receive the priestly office<a name="fnB154" href="heb_note.htm#fn154"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> have authorization according to the law to collect a tithe from the people, that is, from their fellow countrymen,<a name="fnB155" href="heb_note.htm#fn155"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> although they too are descendants of Abraham.<a name="fnB156" href="heb_note.htm#fn156"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  But Melchizedek<a name="fnB157" href="heb_note.htm#fn157"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> who does not share their ancestry<a name="fnB158" href="heb_note.htm#fn158"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> collected a tithe<a name="fnB159" href="heb_note.htm#fn159"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> from Abraham and blessed<a name="fnB160" href="heb_note.htm#fn160"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> the one who possessed the promise. 
<bqverse 7>7  Now without dispute the inferior is blessed by the superior, 
<bqverse 8>8  and in one case tithes are received by mortal men, while in the other by him who is affirmed to be alive. 
<bqverse 9>9  And it could be said that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid a tithe through Abraham. 
<bqverse 10>10  For he was still in his ancestor's loins<a name="fnB161" href="heb_note.htm#fn161"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> when Melchizedek met him.<a name="_Toc403221994"></a><a name="_Toc416894484"></a><a name="_Toc432265347"></a><a name="_Toc485060288"></a><a name="_Toc494013785"></a></p>
<p><i>The Significance of Jesus' Melchizedekan Priesthood</i>
<p>
<bqverse 11>11  So if perfection had in fact been possible through the levitical priesthood--for on that basis<a name="fnB162" href="heb_note.htm#fn162"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> the people received the law--what further need would there have been for another priest to arise, said to be in the order of Melchizedek and not in Aaron's order? 
<bqverse 12>12  For when the priesthood changes, a change in the law must come<a name="fnB163" href="heb_note.htm#fn163"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> as well. 
<bqverse 13>13  Yet the one these things are spoken about belongs to<a name="fnB164" href="heb_note.htm#fn164"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> a different tribe, and no one from that tribe<a name="fnB165" href="heb_note.htm#fn165"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> has ever officiated at the altar. 
<bqverse 14>14  For it is clear that our Lord is descended from Judah, yet Moses said nothing about priests in connection with that tribe. 
<bqverse 15>15  And this is even clearer if another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek, 
<bqverse 16>16  who has become a priest not by a legal regulation about physical descent<a name="fnB166" href="heb_note.htm#fn166"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> but by the power of an indestructible life. 
<bqverse 17>17  For here is the testimony about him:<a name="fnB167" href="heb_note.htm#fn167"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> "<b><i>You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek</i></b>."<a name="fnB168" href="heb_note.htm#fn168"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  On the one hand a former command is set aside<a name="fnB169" href="heb_note.htm#fn169"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> because it is weak and useless,<a name="fnB170" href="heb_note.htm#fn170"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  for the law made nothing perfect. On the other hand a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God. 
<bqverse 20>20  And since<a name="fnB171" href="heb_note.htm#fn171"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> this was not done without a sworn affirmation--for the others have become priests without a sworn affirmation, 
<bqverse 21>21  but Jesus<a name="fnB172" href="heb_note.htm#fn172"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> did so<a name="fnB173" href="heb_note.htm#fn173"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> with a sworn affirmation by the one who said to him, "<b><i>The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind</i></b><i>,</i> `<b><i>You are a priest forever</i></b>'"<a name="fnB174" href="heb_note.htm#fn174"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a>-- 
<bqverse 22>22  accordingly Jesus has become the guarantee<a name="fnB175" href="heb_note.htm#fn175"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> of a better covenant. 
<bqverse 23>23  And the others<a name="fnB176" href="heb_note.htm#fn176"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> who became priests were numerous, because death prevented them<a name="fnB177" href="heb_note.htm#fn177"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> from continuing in office,<a name="fnB178" href="heb_note.htm#fn178"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  but he holds his priesthood permanently since he lives forever. 
<bqverse 25>25  So he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them. 
<bqverse 26>26  For it is indeed fitting for us to have such a high priest: holy, innocent, undefiled, separate from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. 
<bqverse 27>27  He has no need to do every day what those priests do, to offer sacrifices first for their own sins and then for the sins of the people, since he did this in offering himself once for all. 
<bqverse 28>28  For the law appoints as high priests men subject to weakness,<a name="fnB179" href="heb_note.htm#fn179"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> but the word of solemn affirmation that came after the law appoints a son made perfect forever.

<p><i>The High Priest of a Better Covenant</i>
<p><A NAME="8"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Now the main point of what we are saying is this:<a name="fnB180" href="heb_note.htm#fn180"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> we have such a high priest, one who <i>sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven</i>,<a name="fnB181" href="heb_note.htm#fn181"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  a minister in the sanctuary and the true tabernacle that the Lord, not man, set up. 
<bqverse 3>3  For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. So this one too had to have something to offer. 
<bqverse 4>4  Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest, since there are already priests who offer<a name="fnB182" href="heb_note.htm#fn182"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> the gifts prescribed by the law. 
<bqverse 5>5  The place where they serve is<a name="fnB183" href="heb_note.htm#fn183"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> a pattern<a name="fnB184" href="heb_note.htm#fn184"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary, just as Moses was warned by God as he was about to complete the tabernacle.

<p><i>The Arrangement and Ritual of the Earthly Sanctuary</i>
<p><A NAME="9"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Now the first covenant,<a name="fnB205" href="heb_note.htm#fn205"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> in fact, had regulations for worship and its earthly sanctuary. 
<bqverse 2>2  For a tent was prepared, the outer one,<a name="fnB206" href="heb_note.htm#fn206"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> which contained<a name="fnB207" href="heb_note.htm#fn207"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> the lampstand, the table, and the presentation of the loaves; this<a name="fnB208" href="heb_note.htm#fn208"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> is called the holy place. 
<bqverse 3>3  And after the second curtain there was a tent called the holy of holies. 
<bqverse 4>4  It contained the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered entirely with gold. In this ark<a name="fnB209" href="heb_note.htm#fn209"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> were the golden urn containing the manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant. 
<bqverse 5>5  And above the ark<a name="fnB210" href="heb_note.htm#fn210"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> were the cherubim<a name="fnB211" href="heb_note.htm#fn211"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Now is not the time to speak of these things in detail. 
<bqverse 6>6  So with these things prepared like this, the priests enter continually into the outer tent<a name="fnB212" href="heb_note.htm#fn212"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> as they perform their duties. 
<bqverse 7>7  But only the high priest enters once a year into the inner tent,<a name="fnB213" href="heb_note.htm#fn213"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> and not without blood that he offers for himself and the errors of the people.<a name="fnB214" href="heb_note.htm#fn214"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  The Holy Spirit is making clear that the way into the holy place had not yet appeared as long as the old tabernacle<a name="fnB215" href="heb_note.htm#fn215"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> was standing. 
<bqverse 9>9  This was a symbol for the time then present, when gifts and sacrifices were offered that could not perfect the conscience of the worshiper. 
<bqverse 10>10  They served only for matters of food and drink<a name="fnB216" href="heb_note.htm#fn216"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> and various washings; they are external regulations imposed until the new order came.<a name="fnB217" href="heb_note.htm#fn217"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc403221997"></a><a name="_Toc416894487"></a><a name="_Toc432265350"></a><a name="_Toc485060291"></a><a name="_Toc494013788"></a></p>
<p><i>Christ's Service in the Heavenly Sanctuary</i>
<p>
<bqverse 11>11  But now Christ has come<a name="fnB218" href="heb_note.htm#fn218"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> as the high priest of the good things to come. He passed through the greater and more perfect tent not made with hands, that is, not of this creation, 
<bqverse 12>12  and he entered once for all into the most holy place not by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood, and so he himself secured<a name="fnB219" href="heb_note.htm#fn219"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> eternal redemption. 
<bqverse 13>13  For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow sprinkled on those who are defiled consecrated them and provided ritual purity,<a name="fnB220" href="heb_note.htm#fn220"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our<a name="fnB221" href="heb_note.htm#fn221"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> conscience from dead works to worship the living God.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  And so he is the mediator<a name="fnB222" href="heb_note.htm#fn222"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the eternal inheritance he has promised,<a name="fnB223" href="heb_note.htm#fn223"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> since he died<a name="fnB224" href="heb_note.htm#fn224"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> to set them free from the violations committed under the first covenant. 
<bqverse 16>16  For where there is a will, the death of the one who made it must be proven.<a name="fnB225" href="heb_note.htm#fn225"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  For a will takes effect only at death, since it carries no force while the one who made it is alive. 
<bqverse 18>18  So even the first covenant was inaugurated with blood.<a name="fnB226" href="heb_note.htm#fn226"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  For when Moses had spoken every command to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, 
<bqverse 20>20  and said, "<b><i>This is the blood of the covenant that the Lord has commanded you to keep</i></b>."<a name="fnB227" href="heb_note.htm#fn227"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  And both the tabernacle and all the utensils of worship he likewise sprinkled with blood. 
<bqverse 22>22  Indeed according to the law almost everything was purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. 
<bqverse 23>23  So it was necessary for the patterns<a name="fnB228" href="heb_note.htm#fn228"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> of the things in heaven to be purified with these sacrifices,<a name="fnB229" href="heb_note.htm#fn229"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> but the heavenly things themselves required<a name="fnB230" href="heb_note.htm#fn230"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> better sacrifices than these. 
<bqverse 24>24  For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with hands--the representation<a name="fnB231" href="heb_note.htm#fn231"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> of the true sanctuary<a name="fnB232" href="heb_note.htm#fn232"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a>--but into heaven itself, and he appears now in God's presence for us. 
<bqverse 25>25  And he did not enter to offer<a name="fnB233" href="heb_note.htm#fn233"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the sanctuary year after year with blood that is not his own, 
<bqverse 26>26  for then he would have had to suffer again and again since the foundation of the world. But now he has appeared once for all at the consummation of the ages to put away sin by his sacrifice. 
<bqverse 27>27  And just as people are appointed to die once, and then to face judgment,<a name="fnB234" href="heb_note.htm#fn234"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  so also, after Christ was offered once to <i>bear the sins of many</i>,<a name="fnB235" href="heb_note.htm#fn235"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> to those who eagerly await him he will appear a second time, not to bear sin<a name="fnB236" href="heb_note.htm#fn236"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> but to bring salvation.<a name="fnB237" href="heb_note.htm#fn237"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqchapter 10>

<p><i>Concluding Exposition: Old and New Sacrifices Contrasted</i>
<p><A NAME="10"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> For the law possesses a shadow of the good things to come but not the reality itself, and is therefore completely unable, by the same sacrifices offered continually, year after year, to perfect those who come to worship.<a name="fnB238" href="heb_note.htm#fn238"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  For otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers would have been purified once for all and so have<a name="fnB239" href="heb_note.htm#fn239"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> no further consciousness of sin? 
<bqverse 3>3  But in those sacrifices<a name="fnB240" href="heb_note.htm#fn240"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> there is a reminder of sins year after year. 
<bqverse 4>4  For the blood of bulls and goats cannot take away sins.<a name="fnB241" href="heb_note.htm#fn241"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  So when he came into the world, he said,</p>
<br><b><i>"<b><i>Sacrifice and offering you did not desire</i></b><i>,<b> but a body you prepared for me</b>.</i><br>
<bqverse 6>6 "<b><i>Whole burnt offerings and sin-offerings you took no delight in</i></b><i>.</i><br>
<bqverse 7>7 "<b><i>Then I said</i></b><i>,<b> </b></i>`<b><i>Here I am:</i></b><a name="fnB242" href="heb_note.htm#fn242"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> I have come--it is written of me in the scroll of the book--to do your will</i></b><i>,<b> O God</b>.</i>'"<a name="fnB243" href="heb_note.htm#fn243"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a></i></b></ul><p>
<bqverse 8>8  When he says above, "<b><i>Sacrifices and offerings</i></b> and <b><i>whole burnt offerings and sin-offerings</i></b> <b><i>you did not desire nor did you take delight</i></b> in them"<a name="fnB244" href="heb_note.htm#fn244"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> (which are offered according to the law), 
<bqverse 9>9  then he says, "<b><i>Here I am:</i></b> <b><i>I have come to do your will</i></b>." He does away with<a name="fnB245" href="heb_note.htm#fn245"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> the first to establish the second. 
<bqverse 10>10  By his will<a name="fnB246" href="heb_note.htm#fn246"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> we have been made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. 
<bqverse 11>11  And every priest stands day after day<a name="fnB247" href="heb_note.htm#fn247"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> serving and offering the same sacrifices again and again--sacrifices that can never take away sins. 
<bqverse 12>12  But when this priest<a name="fnB248" href="heb_note.htm#fn248"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> had offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, <i>he sat down at the right hand</i><a name="fnB249" href="heb_note.htm#fn249"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> of God, 
<bqverse 13>13  where he is now waiting<a name="fnB250" href="heb_note.htm#fn250"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> <i>until his enemies are made a footstool for his feet</i>.<a name="fnB251" href="heb_note.htm#fn251"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who are made holy. 
<bqverse 15>15  And the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us, for after saying,<a name="fnB252" href="heb_note.htm#fn252"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  "<b><i>This is the covenant that I will establish with them after those days</i></b><i>,<b> says the Lord</b>.<b> I will put</b></i><a name="fnB253" href="heb_note.htm#fn253"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> <b><i>my laws on their hearts and I will inscribe them on their minds</i></b>,"<a name="fnB254" href="heb_note.htm#fn254"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  then he says,<a name="fnB255" href="heb_note.htm#fn255"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> "<b><i>Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no longer</i></b>."<a name="fnB256" href="heb_note.htm#fn256"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.<a name="_Toc403221999"></a><a name="_Toc416894489"></a><a name="_Toc432265352"></a><a name="_Toc485060293"></a><a name="_Toc494013790"></a></p>
<p><i>Drawing Near to God in Enduring Faith</i>
<p>
<bqverse 19>19  Therefore, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB257" href="heb_note.htm#fn257"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus, 
<bqverse 20>20  by the fresh and living way that he inaugurated for us<a name="fnB258" href="heb_note.htm#fn258"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> through the curtain, that is, through his flesh,<a name="fnB259" href="heb_note.htm#fn259"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  and since we have a great priest<a name="fnB260" href="heb_note.htm#fn260"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> over the house of God, 
<bqverse 22>22  let us draw near with a sincere heart in the assurance that faith brings,<a name="fnB261" href="heb_note.htm#fn261"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> because we have had our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience<a name="fnB262" href="heb_note.htm#fn262"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> and our bodies washed in pure water. 
<bqverse 23>23  And let us hold unwaveringly to the hope that we confess, for the one who made the promise is trustworthy. 
<bqverse 24>24  And let us take thought of how to spur one another on to love and good works,<a name="fnB263" href="heb_note.htm#fn263"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  not abandoning our own meetings, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging each other, and even more so because you see the day<a name="fnB264" href="heb_note.htm#fn264"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> drawing near.<a name="fnB265" href="heb_note.htm#fn265"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 26>26  For if we deliberately keep on sinning after receiving the knowledge of the truth, no further sacrifice for sins is left for us,<a name="fnB266" href="heb_note.htm#fn266"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  but only a certain fearful expectation of judgment and <i>a fury</i><a name="fnB267" href="heb_note.htm#fn267"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> <i>of fire that will consume God's enemies</i>.<a name="fnB268" href="heb_note.htm#fn268"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  Someone who rejected the law of Moses was put to death<a name="fnB269" href="heb_note.htm#fn269"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> without mercy <i>on the testimony of two or three witnesses</i>.<a name="fnB270" href="heb_note.htm#fn270"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 29>29  How much greater punishment do you think that person deserves who has contempt for<a name="fnB271" href="heb_note.htm#fn271"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> the Son of God, and profanes<a name="fnB272" href="heb_note.htm#fn272"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> the blood of the covenant that made him holy,<a name="fnB273" href="heb_note.htm#fn273"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> and insults the Spirit of grace? 
<bqverse 30>30  For we know the one who said, "<b><i>Vengeance is mine</i></b><i>,<b> I will repay</b></i>,"<a name="fnB274" href="heb_note.htm#fn274"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> and again, "<b><i>The Lord will judge his people</i></b>."<a name="fnB275" href="heb_note.htm#fn275"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 31>31  It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.<p>

<bqverse 32>32  But remember the former days when you endured a harsh conflict of suffering after you were enlightened. 
<bqverse 33>33  At times you were publicly exposed to abuse and afflictions, and at other times you came to share with others who were treated in that way. 
<bqverse 34>34  For in fact you shared the sufferings of those in prison, and you accepted the confiscation of your belongings with joy, because you knew that you certainly<a name="fnB276" href="heb_note.htm#fn276"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> had a better and lasting possession. 
<bqverse 35>35  So do not throw away your confidence, because it<a name="fnB277" href="heb_note.htm#fn277"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> has great reward. 
<bqverse 36>36  For you need endurance in order to do God's will and so receive what is promised.<a name="fnB278" href="heb_note.htm#fn278"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 37>37  For <b><i>just a little longer</i></b> and <b><i>he who is coming will arrive and not delay</i></b>.<a name="fnB279" href="heb_note.htm#fn279"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>People Commended for Their Faith</i>
<p><A NAME="11"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Now faith is being sure of what we hope for, being convinced of what we do not see. 
<bqverse 2>2  For by it the people of old<a name="fnB283" href="heb_note.htm#fn283"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> received God's commendation.<a name="fnB284" href="heb_note.htm#fn284"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  By faith we understand that the worlds<a name="fnB285" href="heb_note.htm#fn285"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> were set in order at God's command,<a name="fnB286" href="heb_note.htm#fn286"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> so that the visible has its origin in the invisible.<a name="fnB287" href="heb_note.htm#fn287"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  By faith Abel offered God a greater sacrifice than Cain, and through his faith<a name="fnB288" href="heb_note.htm#fn288"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> he was commended as righteous, because God commended him for his offerings. And through his faith<a name="fnB289" href="heb_note.htm#fn289"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> he still speaks, though he is dead. 
<bqverse 5>5  By faith Enoch was taken up so that he did not see death, and he was not to be found because God took him up. For before his removal he had been commended as having pleased God. 
<bqverse 6>6  Now without faith it is impossible to please him, for the one who approaches God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. 
<bqverse 7>7  By faith Noah, when he was warned about things not yet seen, reverently<a name="fnB290" href="heb_note.htm#fn290"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> constructed an ark for the deliverance of his family. Through faith he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.<p>

<bqverse 8>8  By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place he would later receive as an inheritance, and he went out without understanding where he was going. 
<bqverse 9>9  By faith he lived as a foreigner<a name="fnB291" href="heb_note.htm#fn291"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> in the promised land as though it were a foreign country, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who were fellow heirs<a name="fnB292" href="heb_note.htm#fn292"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> of the same promise. 
<bqverse 10>10  For he was looking forward to the city with firm foundations,<a name="fnB293" href="heb_note.htm#fn293"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> whose architect and builder is God. 
<bqverse 11>11  By faith, even though Sarah herself was barren and he was too old,<a name="fnB294" href="heb_note.htm#fn294"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> he received the ability to procreate,<a name="fnB295" href="heb_note.htm#fn295"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> because he regarded the one who had given the promise to be trustworthy. 
<bqverse 12>12  So in fact children<a name="fnB296" href="heb_note.htm#fn296"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> were fathered by one man--and this one as good as dead--<i>like the number of stars in the sky and like the innumerable grains of sand</i><a name="fnB297" href="heb_note.htm#fn297"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a><i> on the seashore</i>.<a name="fnB298" href="heb_note.htm#fn298"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  These all died in faith without receiving the things promised,<a name="fnB299" href="heb_note.htm#fn299"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> but they saw them in the distance and welcomed them and acknowledged that they were strangers and foreigners<a name="fnB300" href="heb_note.htm#fn300"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> on the earth. 
<bqverse 14>14  For those who speak in such a way make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. 
<bqverse 15>15  In fact, if they had been thinking of the land that they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. 
<bqverse 16>16  But as it is,<a name="fnB301" href="heb_note.htm#fn301"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> they aspire to a better land, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them. 
<bqverse 17>17  By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac. He had received the promises,<a name="fnB302" href="heb_note.htm#fn302"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> yet he was ready to offer up<a name="fnB303" href="heb_note.htm#fn303"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> his only son. 
<bqverse 18>18  God had told him, "<b><i>Through Isaac descendants will carry on your name</i></b>,"<a name="fnB304" href="heb_note.htm#fn304"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  and he reasoned<a name="fnB305" href="heb_note.htm#fn305"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> that God could even raise him from the dead, and in a sense<a name="fnB306" href="heb_note.htm#fn306"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> he received him back from there. 
<bqverse 20>20  By faith also Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning the future. 
<bqverse 21>21  By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and <b><i>worshiped as he leaned on his staff</i></b>.<a name="fnB307" href="heb_note.htm#fn307"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  By faith Joseph, at the end of his life,<a name="fnB308" href="heb_note.htm#fn308"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> mentioned the exodus of the sons of Israel<a name="fnB309" href="heb_note.htm#fn309"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> and gave instructions about his burial.<a name="fnB310" href="heb_note.htm#fn310"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 23>23  By faith, when Moses was born, his parents hid him<a name="fnB311" href="heb_note.htm#fn311"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> for three months, because they saw the child was beautiful and they were not afraid of the king's edict. 
<bqverse 24>24  By faith, when he grew up, Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, 
<bqverse 25>25  choosing rather to be ill-treated with the people of God than to enjoy sin's fleeting pleasure. 
<bqverse 26>26  He regarded abuse suffered for Christ<a name="fnB312" href="heb_note.htm#fn312"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> to be greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for his eyes were fixed on<a name="fnB313" href="heb_note.htm#fn313"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> the reward. 
<bqverse 27>27  By faith he left Egypt without fearing the king's anger, for he persevered as though he could see the one who is invisible. 
<bqverse 28>28  By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood,<a name="fnB314" href="heb_note.htm#fn314"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> so that the one who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them. 
<bqverse 29>29  By faith they crossed the Red Sea as if on dry ground, but when the Egyptians tried it, they were swallowed up. 
<bqverse 30>30  By faith the walls of Jericho fell after the people marched around them<a name="fnB315" href="heb_note.htm#fn315"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> for seven days. 
<bqverse 31>31  By faith Rahab the prostitute escaped the destruction of<a name="fnB316" href="heb_note.htm#fn316"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> the disobedient, because she welcomed the spies in peace.<p>

<bqverse 32>32  And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets. 
<bqverse 33>33  Through faith they conquered kingdoms, administered justice,<a name="fnB317" href="heb_note.htm#fn317"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> gained what was promised,<a name="fnB318" href="heb_note.htm#fn318"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> shut the mouths of lions, 
<bqverse 34>34  quenched raging fire,<a name="fnB319" href="heb_note.htm#fn319"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> escaped the edge of the sword, gained strength in weakness,<a name="fnB320" href="heb_note.htm#fn320"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> became mighty in battle, put foreign armies to flight, 
<bqverse 35>35  and women received back their dead raised to life.<a name="fnB321" href="heb_note.htm#fn321"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> But others were tortured, not accepting release, to obtain resurrection to a better life.<a name="fnB322" href="heb_note.htm#fn322"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 36>36  And others experienced mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. 
<bqverse 37>37  They were stoned, sawed apart,<a name="fnB323" href="heb_note.htm#fn323"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> murdered with the sword; they went about in sheepskins and goatskins; they were destitute, afflicted, ill-treated 
<bqverse 38>38  (the world was not worthy of them); they wandered in deserts and mountains and caves and openings in the earth. 
<bqverse 39>39  And these all were commended<a name="fnB324" href="heb_note.htm#fn324"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> for their faith, yet they did not receive what was promised.<a name="fnB325" href="heb_note.htm#fn325"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 40>40  For God had provided something better for us, so that they would be made perfect together with us.<a name="fnB326" href="heb_note.htm#fn326"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>The Lord's Discipline</i>
<p><A NAME="12"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses,<a name="fnB327" href="heb_note.htm#fn327"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> we must get rid of every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and run with endurance the race set out for us, 
<bqverse 2>2  keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith. For the joy set out for him he endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and <i>has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne</i> of God.<a name="fnB328" href="heb_note.htm#fn328"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  Think of him who endured such opposition against himself by sinners, so that you may not grow weary in your souls and give up. 
<bqverse 4>4  You have not yet resisted to the point of bloodshed<a name="fnB329" href="heb_note.htm#fn329"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> in your struggle against sin. 
<bqverse 5>5  And have you forgotten the exhortation addressed to you as sons?</p>
<br><b><i>"<b><i>My son</i></b><i>,<b> do not scorn</b></i><a name="fnB330" href="heb_note.htm#fn330"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> the Lord's discipline </i></b><br>
<b><i>or give up when he corrects</i></b><a name="fnB331" href="heb_note.htm#fn331"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> you</i></b><i>.</i><br>
<bqverse 6>6 "<b><i>For the Lord disciplines the one he loves and chastises every son he accepts</i></b><i>.</i>"<a name="fnB332" href="heb_note.htm#fn332"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a></i></b></ul><p>
<bqverse 7>7  Endure your suffering<a name="fnB333" href="heb_note.htm#fn333"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> as discipline;<a name="fnB334" href="heb_note.htm#fn334"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> God is treating you as sons. For what son is there that a father does not discipline? 
<bqverse 8>8  But if you do not experience discipline,<a name="fnB335" href="heb_note.htm#fn335"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> something all sons<a name="fnB336" href="heb_note.htm#fn336"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> have shared in, then you are illegitimate and not sons. 
<bqverse 9>9  Besides, we have experienced discipline from<a name="fnB337" href="heb_note.htm#fn337"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> our earthly fathers<a name="fnB338" href="heb_note.htm#fn338"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> and we respected them; shall we not submit ourselves all the more to the Father of spirits and receive life?<a name="fnB339" href="heb_note.htm#fn339"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  For they disciplined us for a little while as seemed good to them, but he does so for our benefit, that we may share his holiness. 
<bqverse 11>11  Now all discipline seems painful at the time, not joyful.<a name="fnB340" href="heb_note.htm#fn340"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> But later it produces the fruit of peace and righteousness<a name="fnB341" href="heb_note.htm#fn341"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> for those trained by it. 
<bqverse 12>12  Therefore, <b><i>strengthen</i></b><a name="fnB342" href="heb_note.htm#fn342"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> <b><i>your listless hands and your weak knees</i></b>,<a name="fnB343" href="heb_note.htm#fn343"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  and <b><i>make straight paths for your feet</i></b>,<a name="fnB344" href="heb_note.htm#fn344"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but healed.<a name="_Toc403222002"></a><a name="_Toc416894492"></a><a name="_Toc432265355"></a><a name="_Toc485060296"></a><a name="_Toc494013793"></a></p>
<p><i>Do Not Reject God's Warning </i>
<p>
<bqverse 14>14  Pursue peace with everyone, and holiness,<a name="fnB345" href="heb_note.htm#fn345"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> for without it no one will see the Lord. 
<bqverse 15>15  See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God, that no one be like <i>a bitter root</i> <i>springing up</i><a name="fnB346" href="heb_note.htm#fn346"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> and causing trouble, and through him many become defiled. 
<bqverse 16>16  And see to it that no one becomes<a name="fnB347" href="heb_note.htm#fn347"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> an immoral or godless person like Esau, who <i>sold his own birthright for a single meal</i>.<a name="fnB348" href="heb_note.htm#fn348"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  For you know that<a name="fnB349" href="heb_note.htm#fn349"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> later when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no opportunity for repentance, although he sought the blessing<a name="fnB350" href="heb_note.htm#fn350"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> with tears. 
<bqverse 18>18  For you have not come to something that can be touched,<a name="fnB351" href="heb_note.htm#fn351"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> to a burning fire and darkness and gloom and a whirlwind 
<bqverse 19>19  and the blast of a trumpet and a voice uttering words<a name="fnB352" href="heb_note.htm#fn352"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> such that those who heard begged to hear no more.<a name="fnB353" href="heb_note.htm#fn353"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  For they could not bear what was commanded: "<b><i>If even an animal touches the mountain</i></b><i>,<b> it must be stoned</b></i>."<a name="fnB354" href="heb_note.htm#fn354"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  In fact, the scene<a name="fnB355" href="heb_note.htm#fn355"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> was so terrifying that Moses said, "<b><i>I shudder with fear</i></b>."<a name="fnB356" href="heb_note.htm#fn356"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  But you have come to Mount Zion, the city<a name="fnB357" href="heb_note.htm#fn357"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels, to the assembly 
<bqverse 23>23  and congregation of the firstborn, who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous, who have been made perfect, 
<bqverse 24>24  and to Jesus, the mediator<a name="fnB358" href="heb_note.htm#fn358"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks of something better than Abel's does.<a name="fnB359" href="heb_note.htm#fn359"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 25>25  Take care not to refuse the one who is speaking! For if they did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth, how much less shall we, if we reject the one who warns from heaven? 
<bqverse 26>26  Then his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, "<b><i>I will once more shake not only the earth but heaven too</i></b>."<a name="fnB360" href="heb_note.htm#fn360"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  Now this phrase "<b><i>once more</i></b>" indicates the removal of what is shaken, that is, of created things, so that what is unshaken may remain. 
<bqverse 28>28  So since we are receiving an unshakable kingdom, let us give thanks, and through this let us offer worship pleasing to God in devotion and awe. 
<bqverse 29>29  For our <b><i>God is indeed a devouring fire</i></b>.<a name="fnB361" href="heb_note.htm#fn361"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Final Exhortations</i>
<p><A NAME="13"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Brotherly love must continue. 
<bqverse 2>2  Do not neglect hospitality, because through it some have entertained angels without knowing it.<a name="fnB362" href="heb_note.htm#fn362"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  Remember those in prison as though you were in prison with them,<a name="fnB363" href="heb_note.htm#fn363"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> and those ill-treated as though you too felt their torment.<a name="fnB364" href="heb_note.htm#fn364"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  Marriage must be honored among all and the marriage bed kept undefiled, for sexually immoral people and adulterers God will judge. 
<bqverse 5>5  Your conduct must be free from the love of money and you must be content with what you have, for he has said, "<b><i>I will never leave you and I will never abandon you</i></b>."<a name="fnB365" href="heb_note.htm#fn365"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  So we can say with confidence, "<b><i>The Lord is my helper</i></b><i>,<b> and</b></i><a name="fnB366" href="heb_note.htm#fn366"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> I will not be afraid</i></b><i>.<b> What can man do to me?</b></i>"<a name="fnB367" href="heb_note.htm#fn367"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  Remember your leaders, who spoke God's message to you; reflect on the outcome of their lives and imitate their faith. 
<bqverse 8>8  Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever! 
<bqverse 9>9  Do not be carried away by all sorts of strange teachings.<a name="fnB368" href="heb_note.htm#fn368"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> For it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not ritual meals,<a name="fnB369" href="heb_note.htm#fn369"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> which have never benefited those who participated in them. 
<bqverse 10>10  We have an altar that those who serve in the tabernacle have no right to eat from. 
<bqverse 11>11  For the bodies of those animals whose blood the high priest brings<a name="fnB370" href="heb_note.htm#fn370"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> into the sanctuary as an offering for sin are burned outside the camp. 
<bqverse 12>12  Therefore, to sanctify the people by his own blood, Jesus also suffered outside the camp. 
<bqverse 13>13  We must go out to him, then, outside the camp, bearing the abuse he experienced.<a name="fnB371" href="heb_note.htm#fn371"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  For here we have no lasting city, but we seek the city that is to come. 
<bqverse 15>15  Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips, acknowledging his name. 
<bqverse 16>16  And do not neglect to do good and to share what you have,<a name="fnB372" href="heb_note.htm#fn372"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> for God is pleased with such sacrifices.<p>

<bqverse 17>17  Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls and will give an account for their work.<a name="fnB373" href="heb_note.htm#fn373"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> Let them do this<a name="fnB374" href="heb_note.htm#fn374"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> with joy and not with complaints, for this would be no advantage for you. 
<bqverse 18>18  Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to conduct ourselves rightly in every respect. 
<bqverse 19>19  I especially ask you to pray<a name="fnB375" href="heb_note.htm#fn375"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> that I may be restored to you very soon.<a name="_Toc403222004"></a><a name="_Toc416894494"></a><a name="_Toc432265357"></a><a name="_Toc485060298"></a><a name="_Toc494013795"></a></p>
<p><i>Benediction and Conclusion</i>
<p>
<bqverse 20>20  Now may the God of peace who by the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep, our Lord Jesus Christ, 
<bqverse 21>21  equip you with every good thing to do his will, working in you what is pleasing before him through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever.<a name="fnB376" href="heb_note.htm#fn376"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> Amen. 
<bqverse 22>22  Now I urge you, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB377" href="heb_note.htm#fn377"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> bear with my message of exhortation, for in fact I have written to you briefly.

If he comes soon, he will be with me when I see you.<a name="fnB379" href="heb_note.htm#fn379"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a>
