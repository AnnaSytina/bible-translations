 <b>tn</b> (1:1)  Or "This is a record of what Jeremiah prophesied"; <i>Heb</i> "The words [or, affairs] of Jeremiah." The phrase could refer to either the messages of Jeremiah recorded in the book or to both his messages and the biographical (and autobiographical) narratives recorded about him in the book. Since the phrase is intended to serve as the title or superscription for the whole book and recurs again in 51:64 at the end of the book before the final appendix, it is likely that it refers to the latter.<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="jer.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:2)  The translation reflects the ancient Jewish tradition of substituting the word for "Lord" for the proper name for Israel's God which is now generally agreed to have been Yahweh. Jewish scribes wrote the consonants YHWH but substituted the vowels for the word "Lord." The practice of calling him "Lord" rather than using his proper name is also reflected in the Greek translation which is the oldest translation of the Hebrew Bible. The meaning of the name Yahweh is supposedly given in Exod 3:13-14 where God identifies himself as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and tells Moses that his name is "I am" (<i>`ehyeh</i>). However, he instructs Moses to tell the Israelites that YHWH ("Yahweh") sent him. That is to be his everlasting name (see further Exod 34:5-6).<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="jer.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  <i>Heb</i> "to whom the word of the LORD came." The proposed translation is more in keeping with contemporary English idiom. The idea of "<i>began</i> to speak" comes from the context where the conclusion of his speaking is signaled by the phrases "until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah" and "until the people of Jerusalem were taken into exile" in v. 3.<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="jer.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:3)  This would have been August, 586 B.C. according to modern reckoning.<br>
 <a name="fn4" href="jer.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  <i>Heb</i> "and it [the word of the LORD] came in the days of Jehoiakim...until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah...until the carrying away captive of Jerusalem in the fifth month."<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="jer.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Heb</i> "the womb." The words "your mother's" are implicit and are supplied in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn6" href="jer.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Heb</i> "I knew you." The parallelism here with "set you apart" and "appointed you" make clear that Jeremiah is speaking of his foreordination to be a prophet. For this same nuance of the Hebrew verb see Gen 18:19; Amos 3:2.<br>
 <a name="fn7" href="jer.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  <i>Heb</i> "Lord Yahweh."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:6)  The translation follows the ancient Jewish tradition of substituting the Hebrew word for "God" for the proper name Yahweh in this compound name. See the study note on v. 2 for the substitution of "Lord" in a similar kind of situation.<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="jer.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  This is an attempt to render a Hebrew particle (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hN}h!</FONT>, commonly rendered "behold") which calls attention to the presence of a person or thing, the immediacy of an act, or the reality of a fact.<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="jer.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  The words "well enough for that" are implicit and are supplied in the translation for clarity. Jeremiah is not claiming an absolute inability to speak.<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="jer.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  <i>Heb</i> "I am a boy/youth." The Hebrew word can refer to an infant (Exod 2:6), a young boy (1 Sam 2:11), a teenager (Gen 21:12), or a young man (2 Sam 18:5). The translation is deliberately ambiguous since it is unclear how old Jeremiah was when he was called to begin prophesying. <br>
 <a name="fn11" href="jer.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  Or "For you must go and say." The Hebrew particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> is likely adversative here after a negative statement (cf. BDB 474 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> 3.e). The LORD is probably not giving a rationale for the denial of Jeremiah's objection but redirecting his focus, i.e., "do not say...but go...and say."<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="jer.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:8)  <i>Heb</i> "be afraid of them." The antecedent is the "whomever" in v. 7.<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="jer.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  <i>Heb</i> "Behold, I have put my words in your mouth." This is an example of the Hebrew "scheduling" perfect or the "prophetic" perfect where a future event is viewed as so certain it is spoken of as past. The Hebrew particle rendered here "assuredly" (<i>Heb</i><FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> hN}h!</FONT>) underlines the certitude of the promise for the future. See the translator's note on v. 6.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:9)  The passage is reminiscent of Deut 18:18 which refers to the LORD's promise of future revelation through a line of prophets who, like Moses, would speak God's word.<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="jer.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  <i>Heb</i> "See!" The Hebrew imperative of the verb used here (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ha*r&#180;</FONT>) functions the same as the particle in v. 9. See the translator's note there.<br>
 <a name="fn15" href="jer.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  <i>Heb</i> "I appoint you today over nations and kingdoms to uproot...." The phrase refers to the LORD giving Jeremiah authority as a prophet to declare what he, the LORD, will do; it does not mean that Jeremiah himself will do these things. The expression involves a figure of speech where the subject of a declaration is stated instead of the declaration about it. Compare a similar use of the same figure in Gen 41:13.<br>
 <a name="fn16" href="jer.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:10)  These three pairs represent the twofold nature of Jeremiah's prophecies, prophecies of judgment and of restoration. For the further programmatic use of these pairs for Jeremiah's ministry see Jer 18:7-10 and 31:27-28.<br>
 <a name="fn17" href="jer.htm#fnB17"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:12)  This represents the Hebrew particle (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT>) that is normally rendered "for" or "because." The particle here is meant to give the significance of the vision, not the rationale for the statement "you have observed correctly."<br>
 <a name="fn18" href="jer.htm#fnB18"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:12)  <i>Heb</i> "watching over my word to do it."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:12)  There is a play on the Hebrew word for "almond tree" (Heb <i>shaqed</i>) which blossoms in January/February and is the harbinger of spring and the Hebrew word for "watching" (Heb <i>shoqed</i>) which refers to someone watching over someone or something in preparation for action. The play on words announces the certainty and imminency of the LORD carrying out the covenant curses of Lev 26 and Deut 28 threatened by the earlier prophets.<br>
 <a name="fn19" href="jer.htm#fnB19"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13)  <i>Heb</i> "a blown upon [= heated; boiling] pot and its face from the face of the north [= it is facing away from the north]."<br>
 <a name="fn20" href="jer.htm#fnB20"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:14)  There is nothing in the Hebrew text for these words but it is implicit in the connection. Once again the significance of the vision is spelled out. Compare the translator's note on v. 12.<br>
 <a name="fn21" href="jer.htm#fnB21"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:15)  <i>Heb</i> "they will each set up." The pronoun "they" refers back to the "kingdoms" in the preceding sentence. However, kingdoms do not sit on thrones; their kings do. This is an example of a figure of speech called metonymy where the kingdom is put for its king. For a similar use see 2 Chr 12:8. <br>
 <a name="fn22" href="jer.htm#fnB22"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:15)  Or "They will come and set up their thrones in the entrances of the gates of Jerusalem. They will destroy all the walls surrounding it and also destroy all the towns in Judah." The text of v. 15b reads in Hebrew, "they will each set up his throne [near? in?] the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem and against all its walls...and against all the towns...." Commentators are divided over whether the passage refers to the kings setting up their thrones after victory in preparation for passing judgment on their defeated enemies in the city or whether it refers to setting up siege against it. There is no Hebrew preposition before the word for "the entrance" so that it could be "in" (which would imply victory) or "at/near" (which would imply siege), and the same verb + object (i.e., "they will set up their thrones") governs all the locative statements. It is most often taken to refer to the aftermath of victory because of the supposed parallel in Jer 43:8-13 and the supposed fulfillment in Jer 39:3. Though this may fit well with the first part of the compound expression, it does not fit well with the latter part which is most naturally taken to refer to hostile attacks against Jerusalem and the other cities of Judah. The translation given in the text is intended to reflect the idea of an army setting up for siege. The alternate translation is intended to reflect the other view. <br>
 <a name="fn23" href="jer.htm#fnB23"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:16)  The Hebrew particle (the <i>vav</i> consecutive), which is often rendered in some translations "and" and in others is simply ignored, is rendered here epexegetically, reflecting a summary statement.<br>
 <a name="fn24" href="jer.htm#fnB24"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:16)  The Hebrew idiom (literally "I will speak my judgments against") is found three other times in Jeremiah (4:12; 39:5; 52:9), where it is followed by the carrying out of the sentence. Here the carrying out of the sentence precedes in v. 15. <br>
 <a name="fn25" href="jer.htm#fnB25"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:16)  <i>Heb</i> "on them." The antecedent goes back to Jerusalem and the cities of Judah (i.e., the people in them) in v. 15.<br>
 <a name="fn26" href="jer.htm#fnB26"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:16)  I.e., idols.<br>
 <a name="fn27" href="jer.htm#fnB27"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:17)  The name "Jeremiah" is not in the text. The use of the personal pronoun followed by the proper name is an attempt to reflect the correlative emphasis between Jeremiah's responsibility noted here and the LORD's promise noted in the next verse. The emphasis in the Hebrew text is marked by the presence of the subject pronouns at the beginning of each of the two verses.<br>
 <a name="fn28" href="jer.htm#fnB28"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:17)  <i>Heb</i> "gird up your loins." For the literal use of this idiom to refer to preparation for action see 2 Kgs 4:29; 9:1. For the idiomatic use to refer to spiritual and emotional preparation as here, see Job 38:3, 40:7, and 1 Pet 1:13 in the NT.<br>
 <a name="fn29" href="jer.htm#fnB29"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:17)  <i>Heb</i> "I will make you terrified in front of them." There is a play on words here involving two different forms of the same Hebrew verb and two different but related prepositional phrases, "from before/of," a preposition introducing the object of a verb of fearing, and "before, in front of," a preposition introducing a spatial location.<br>
 <a name="fn30" href="jer.htm#fnB30"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:18) See the note on "Jeremiah" at the beginning of v. 17.<br>
 <a name="fn31" href="jer.htm#fnB31"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:18)  <i>Heb</i> "today I have made you." The Hebrew verb form here emphasizes the certainty of a yet future act; the LORD is promising to protect Jeremiah from any future attacks which may result from his faithfully carrying out his commission. See a similar use of the same Hebrew verb tense in v. 9, and see the translator's note there.<br>
 <a name="fn32" href="jer.htm#fnB32"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:18)  <i>Heb</i> "I make you a fortified city...against all the land...." The words "as strong as" and "so you will be able to stand against all the people of..." are given to clarify the meaning of the metaphor.<br>
 <a name="fn33" href="jer.htm#fnB33"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:2)  <i>Heb</i> "to/for you." The preposition here indicates the object of advantage or benefit.<br>
 <a name="fn34" href="jer.htm#fnB34"><sup>2</sup></a><b><i>tn</i></b> <i>Heb</i> "the loyal love of your youth."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:2)  The Hebrew word translated "how devoted you were" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ds#j#</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">j#s#d</FONT>) refers here metaphorically to the devotion of a new bride to her husband. In typical Hebraic fashion, contemporary Israel is identified here with Israel in her early years after she first entered into covenant with (i.e., metaphorically married) the LORD. The reference here to her earlier devotion is not absolute but relative. Compared to her unfaithfulness in worshiping other gods after she got into the land, the murmuring and complaining in the wilderness are ignored.<br>
 <a name="fn35" href="jer.htm#fnB35"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:3)  <i>Heb</i> "the first fruits of his harvest." Many commentators see the figure here as having theological significance for the calling of the Gentiles. It is likely, however, that in this context the metaphor--here rendered as a simile--is intended to bring out the special relationship and inviolability that Israel had with God. As the first fruits were the special possession of the LORD, to be eaten only by the priests and off limits to the common people, so Israel was God's special possession and was not to be "eaten" by the nations.<br>
 <a name="fn36" href="jer.htm#fnB36"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:5)  <i>Heb</i> "fathers."<br>
 <a name="fn37" href="jer.htm#fnB37"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:5)  Or "I did not wrong your ancestors in any way. Yet they went far astray from me." Both translations are an attempt to render the rhetorical question which demands a negative answer.<br>
 <a name="fn38" href="jer.htm#fnB38"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:5)  <i>Heb</i> "They went/followed after." This idiom probably doesn't mean much if translated literally. It is found most often in Deuteronomy or literature related to the covenant. It refers in the first instance to loyalty to God and to his covenant or his commandments (cf., e.g., 1 Kgs 14:8; 2 Chr 34:31) with the metaphor of a path or way underlying it (cf., e.g., Deut 11:28; 28:14). To "follow other gods" was to abandon this way and this loyalty (i.e., to "abandon" or "forget" God, Judg 2:12; Hos 2:13) and to follow the customs or religious traditions of the pagan nations (e.g., 2 Kgs 17:15). The classic text on "following" God or another god is 1 Kgs 18:18, 21 where Elijah taunts the people with "halting between two opinions" whether the LORD was the true God or Baal was. The idiom is often found followed by "to serve and to worship" or "they served and worshiped" such and such a god or entity (see, e.g., Jer 8:2; 11:10; 13:10; 16:11; 25:6; 35:15).<br>
 <a name="fn39" href="jer.htm#fnB39"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:5)  The words "to me" are not in the Hebrew text but are implicit from the context: <i>Heb</i> "they followed after the worthless thing/things and became worthless." There is an obvious wordplay on the verb "became worthless" and the noun "worthless thing," which is probably to be understood collectively and to refer to idols as it does in Jer 8:19; 10:8; 14:22; Jonah 2:8.<br>
 <a name="fn40" href="jer.htm#fnB40"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6)  This word is erroneously rendered "shadow of death" in most older translations. That translation is based on a faulty etymology. Contextual studies and comparative Semitic linguistics have demonstrated that the word is merely another word for darkness. It is confined to poetic texts and often carries, as it does here, further connotations of danger and distress. It is associated in poetic texts with the darkness of a prison (Ps 107:10, 14), a mine (Job 28:3), and a ravine (Ps 23:4). Here it is associated with the darkness of the wasteland and ravines of the Sinai desert.<br>
 <a name="fn41" href="jer.htm#fnB41"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:6)  The context suggests that the question is related to a lament where the people turn to God in their troubles, asking him for help and reminding him of his past benefactions. See for example Isa 63:11-19 and Ps 44. It is an implicit prayer for his intervention, cf. 2 Kgs 2:14.<br>
 <a name="fn42" href="jer.htm#fnB42"><sup>10</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:7)  Note how contemporary Israel is again identified with her early ancestors. See the study note on 2:2.<br>
 <a name="fn43" href="jer.htm#fnB43"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:7)  <i>Heb</i> "eat."<br>
 <a name="fn44" href="jer.htm#fnB44"><sup>12</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:7)  I.e., made it ceremonially unclean. See Lev 18:19-30; Num 35:34; Deut 21:23.<br>
 <a name="fn45" href="jer.htm#fnB45"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:7)  <i>Heb</i> "my inheritance." Or "the land [i.e., inheritance] I gave you," reading the pronoun as indicating source rather than possession. The parallelism and the common use in Jeremiah of the term to refer to the land or people as the LORD's (cf., e.g., 12:7, 8, 9; 16:18; 50:11) make the possessive use more likely here.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:7)  The land belonged to the LORD; it was given to the Israelites in trust (or usufruct) as their heritage. See Lev 25:23.<br>
 <a name="fn46" href="jer.htm#fnB46"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:8)  See the study note on 2:6.<br>
 <a name="fn47" href="jer.htm#fnB47"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:8)  <i>Heb</i> "those who handle my law."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:8)  The reference is likely to the priests and Levites who were responsible for teaching the law (so Jer 18:18, and see also Deut 33:10). According to Jer 8:8 it could possibly refer to the scribes who copied the law.<br>
 <a name="fn48" href="jer.htm#fnB48"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:8)  Or "were not committed to me." The Hebrew verb rendered "know" refers to more than mere intellectual knowledge. It carries also the ideas of emotional and volitional commitment as well intimacy. See for example its use in contexts like Hos 4:1; 6:6.<br>
 <a name="fn49" href="jer.htm#fnB49"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:8)  <i>Heb</i> "by Baal."<br>
 <a name="fn50" href="jer.htm#fnB50"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:8)  <i>Heb</i> "and they followed after those things [the word is plural] which do not profit." The poetic structure of the verse, four lines in which a distinct subject appears at the beginning followed by a fifth line beginning with a prepositional phrase and no distinct subject, argues that this line is climactic and refers to all four classes enumerated in the preceding lines. See W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 1:88-89. There may be a play or pun in the Hebrew text on the name for the god Baal (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu^B^</FONT>) and the verb "cannot help you" (<i>Heb</i> "do not profit") which is spelled <i>yaal</i> in Hebrew (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu^y~</FONT>). <br>
 <a name="fn51" href="jer.htm#fnB51"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:9)  Or "bring charges against you."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:9)  The language used here is that of the law court. In international political contexts it was the language of a great king charging his subject with breach of covenant. See for examples in earlier prophets, Isa 1:2-20; Mic 6:1-8.<br>
 <a name="fn52" href="jer.htm#fnB52"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:9)  The words "your children and" are supplied in the translation to bring out the idea of corporate solidarity implicit in the passage.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:9)  The passage reflects the Hebrew concept of corporate solidarity: what the parents did had implications for their children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren. Compare the usage in the ten commandments, Deut 5:10, and note the execution of the children of Dathan and Abiram, Deut 11:6, and of Achan, Josh 7:24-25.<br>
 <a name="fn53" href="jer.htm#fnB53"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:10)  "For" here introduces the case against Israel. An alternative would be "Here is my case against you:"<br>
 <a name="fn54" href="jer.htm#fnB54"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:10)  <i>Heb</i> "pass over to the coasts of Kittim." The words "west across the sea" in this line and "east of" in the next are implicit in the text and are supplied in the translation to give geographical orientation.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:10)  The Hebrew term translated <i>Cyprus</i> ("Kittim") originally referred to the island of Cyprus but later was used for the lands in the west, including Macedonia (1 Macc 1:1; 8:5) and Rome (Dan 11:30). It is used here as part of a figure called merism to denote the lands in the west as opposed to Kedar which was in the east. The figure includes polar opposites to indicate totality, i.e., everywhere from west to east.<br>
 <a name="fn55" href="jer.htm#fnB55"><sup>23</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:10)  <i>Kedar</i> is the home of the Bedouin tribes in the Syro-Arabian desert. See Gen 25:18 and Jer 49:38. See also the previous note for the significance of the reference here.<br>
 <a name="fn56" href="jer.htm#fnB56"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:11) <i>Heb</i> "have exchanged their glory [i.e., the God in whom they glory]." This is a case of a figure of speech where the attribute of a person or thing is put for the person or thing. Compare the common phrase in Isaiah, the Holy One of Israel, obviously referring to the LORD, the God of Israel.<br>
 <a name="fn57" href="jer.htm#fnB57"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:11)  <i>Heb</i> "what cannot profit." The verb is singular and the allusion is likely to Baal. See the translator's note on 2:8 for the likely pun or wordplay.<br>
 <a name="fn58" href="jer.htm#fnB58"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:12)  In earlier literature the heavens (and the earth) were called on to witness Israel's commitment to the covenant (Deut 30:12) and were called to serve as witnesses to Israel's fidelity or infidelity to it (Isa 1:2; Mic 6:1).<br>
 <a name="fn59" href="jer.htm#fnB59"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:13)  It is difficult to decide here whether to translate "fresh, running water" which the Hebrew term for "living water" often refers to, e.g., Gen 26:19; Lev 14:5, or "life-giving water" which the idiom "fountain of life" as source of life and vitality often refers to, e.g., Ps 36:9; Prov 13:14; 14:27. The contrast with cisterns, which collected and held rain water, suggests "fresh, running water," but the reality underlying the metaphor contrasts the LORD, the source of life, health, and vitality, with useless idols that cannot do anything.<br>
 <a name="fn60" href="jer.htm#fnB60"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:14)  <i>Heb</i> "Is Israel a slave? Or is he a house born slave?" The questions are rhetorical, expecting a negative answer.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:14)  The LORD is here contrasting Israel's lofty status as the LORD's bride and special possession, which he had earlier reminded her of (see 2:2-3), with her current status of servitude to Egypt and Assyria.<br>
 <a name="fn61" href="jer.htm#fnB61"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:15)  <i>Heb</i> "Lions shout over him, they give out [raise] their voices."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:15)  The reference to <i>lions</i> is here a metaphor for the Assyrians (and later the Babylonians, see Jer 50:17). The statement about lions roaring over their prey implies that the prey has been vanquished.<br>
 <a name="fn62" href="jer.htm#fnB62"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:15)  <i>Heb</i> "without inhabitant."<br>
 <a name="fn63" href="jer.htm#fnB63"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tc</b> (2:16)  The translation follows the reading of the Syriac version. The Hebrew text reads "have grazed [= "shaved" ?] your skulls [as a sign of disgracing them]." Note that the reference shifts here from third person, "him," to second person, "you," which is common in Hebrew style. The words "people of Israel" have been supplied in the translation to help identify the referent and ease the switch. The reading here presupposes <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ewur)y+</FONT> a Qal imperfect from the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">uu^r&#180;+</FONT> (see BDB 949 s.v. II <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">uu^r&#180;</FONT> Qal 1 and compare usage in Jer 15:2; Ps 2:9). The MT reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">EWur+y]</FONT>, a Qal imperfect from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hu*r&#180;</FONT> (see BDB 945 s.v. I <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hu*r&#180;</FONT> Qal 2.b for usage). The use of the verb in the Masoretic text is unparalleled in the sense suggested, but the resultant figure, if "graze" can mean "shave," is paralleled in Jer 47:5; 48:37; Isa 7:20. The reading of the variant is accepted here on the basis that it is the rarer root; the scribe would have been more familiar with the root "graze" even though it is unparalleled in the figurative nuance implied here. The noun "head/skull" is functioning in either case as an accusative of further specification (see GKC &#167;117.<i>ll</i> and compare usage in Gen 3:8), i.e., "they crack you on the skull" or "they shave you on the skull." The verb is a prefixed form and in this context is either a preterite without <i>vav</i> consecutive or an iterative imperfect denoting repeated action. Some modern translations render the verb in the future tense, "they will break [or shave] your skull."<br>

 <a name="fn75" href="jer.htm#fnB75"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:19)  <i>Heb</i> "the Lord Yahweh, [the God of] hosts." For the title Lord GOD see the study note on 1:6. For the title "who rules over all" see the following study note. The title "the LORD who rules over all" is a way of rendering the title "Yahweh of armies." It is an abbreviation of a longer title "Yahweh the God of armies" which occurs five times in Jeremiah (see, e.g., 44:7). The abbreviated title occurs seventy-seven times in the book of Jeremiah. On thirty-two occasions it is further qualified by the title "the God of Israel," showing his special relation to Israel. On six occasions it is preceded by the title "Lord" (see, e.g., 46:10) and twice it is preceded by the title "the King" (see, e.g., 51:17). Both titles emphasize his sovereignty. Twice it is said that he is the maker of all things (10:16; 51:19), and once it is said that he made the earth and the people and animals on it and gives them into the control of whomever he wishes (27:4-5). On two occasions it is emphasized that he also made the heavenly elements and controls the natural elements of wind, rain, thunder, and hail (31:35; 51:14-16). All this is consistent with usage elsewhere where the "armies" over which he has charge are identified as (1) the angels which surround his throne (Isa 6:3, 5; 1 Kgs 22:19) and which he sends to protect his servants (2 Kgs 6:17), (2) the natural forces of thunder, rain, and hail (Isa 29:6; Josh 10:11; Judg 5:4, 5) through which he sends the enemy into panic and "gums" up their chariot wheels, (3) the armies of Israel (1 Sam 17:45) which he leads into battle (Num 10:34-35; Josh 5:14, 15) and for whom he fights as a mighty warrior (Exod 15:3; Isa 42:13; Ps 24:8), and even (4) the armies of the nations which he musters against his disobedient people (Isa 13:14). This title is most commonly found in the messenger formula "Thus says..." introducing both oracles of judgment (on Israel [e.g., 9:7, 15] and on the nations [e.g. 46:19; 50:18]; and see in general 25:29-32). It emphasizes his sovereignty as the king and creator, the lord of creation and of history, and the just judge who sees and knows all (11:20; 20:12) and judges each person and nation according to their actions (Jer 32:18-19). In the first instance (in the most dominant usage) this will involve the punishment of his own people through the agency of the Babylonians (cf., e.g., 25:8-9). But it will also include the punishment of all nations, including Babylon itself (cf. Jer 25:17-26, 32-38), and will ultimately result in the restoration of his people and a new relation with them (30:8; 31:35-37).<br>

At issue here is whether the supplication is made to Yahweh in repentance because of what they have done or whether it is supplication to the pagan gods which is evidence of their perverted ways. The reference in this verse to the hilltops where idolatry was practiced according to 3:2 and the reference to Israel's unfaithfulness in the preceding verse make the latter more likely.

However, there is debate about whether these are the response of the people to the LORD's invitation, a response which is said to be inadequate according to the continuation in 4:1-4, or whether these are the LORD's model for Israel's confession of repentance to which he adds further instructions about the proper heart attitude that should accompany it in 4:1-4. The former implies a dialogue with an unmarked twofold shift in speaker between 3:22b-25 and 4:1-4:4 while the latter assumes the same main speaker throughout with an unmarked instruction only in 3:22b-25.

However, the first person reference to the LORD in v. 6 and Jeremiah's response in v. 10 suggest that this is a word from the LORD that he is commanded to pass on to the citizens of Jerusalem and Judah. If the imperatives are not merely rhetorical plurals they may reflect the practice referred to in Jer 23:18, 22; Amos 3:7. A similar phenomenon also occurs in Jer 5:1 and also in Isa 40:1-2.

An alternative translation for the first part of this verse might be, "You have surely let this people be deceived by some who are saying, `You will be safe.'" The words "you will be safe" are, of course, those of the false prophets (cf., Jer 6:14; 8:11; 14:13; 23:16-17). It is difficult to tell whether the charge here is meant literally as the emotional outburst of the prophet (compare for example, Jer 15:18) or whether it is to be understood as a figure of speech in which a verb of direct causation is to be understood as permissive or tolerative, i.e., God did not command the prophets to say this but allowed them to do so. While it is not beyond God to use false prophets to accomplish his will (cf., e.g., 1 Kgs 22:19-23), he elsewhere in the book of Jeremiah directly denies having sent the false prophets to say such things as this (cf., e.g., Jer 14:14-15; 23:21, 32). For examples of the use of this figure of speech, see Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, pp. 571, 823 and compare Ezek 20:25. The translation given does not attempt to resolve the issue.

 <a name="fn217" href="jer.htm#fnB217"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tc</b> (4:19)  The translation reflects a different division of the last two lines than that suggested by the Masoretes. The written text (the Kethib) reads "for the sound of the ram's horn I have heard [or "you have heard," if the form is understood as the old second feminine singular perfect] my soul" followed by " the battle cry" in the last line. The translation is based on taking "my soul" with the last line and understanding an elliptical expression "the battle cry [to] my soul." Such an elliptical expression is in keeping with the elliptical nature of the exclamations at the beginning of the verse (cf. the literal translations of the first two lines of the verse in the notes on the words "stomach" and "heart").<br>

This is probably not a reference to Jeremiah's own tents since he foresees the destruction of the whole land. Jeremiah so identifies with the plight of his people that he sees the destruction of their tents as though they were his very own. It would probably lead to confusion to translate literally and it is not uncommon in Hebrew laments for the community or its representative to speak of the community as an "I."

However, in light of the fact that the word "tent" came to be used generically for a person's home (cf. 1 Kgs 8:66; 12:16), it is possible that Jeremiah is here referring to the destruction of their homes and the resultant feeling of homelessness and loss of even elementary protection.

It is clear from Jer 23:18, 22; Amos 3:7 that the prophets had access to this heavenly counsel through visions (cf. 1 Kgs 22:19-23), so Jeremiah could have been privy to this speech through that means. Though these are the most likely addressee, it is too presumptuous to supply such an explicit addressee without clearer indication in the text. The translation will just have to run the risk of the probable erroneous assumption by most English readers that the addressee is Jeremiah. <br>

However, it is unlikely that, in the context of judgment that Jeremiah has previously been describing, literal lions are meant. The animals are metaphorical for their enemies. Compare Jer 4:7.<br>

 <a name="fn267" href="jer.htm#fnB267"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:7)  <i>Heb</i> "they committed adultery." It is difficult to decide whether literal adultery with other women or spiritual adultery with other gods is meant. The word for adultery is used for both in the book of Jeremiah. For examples of its use for spiritual adultery see 3:8, 9; 9:2. For examples of its use for literal adultery see 7:9; 23:14. The context here could argue for either. The swearing by other gods and the implicit contradiction in their actions in contrast to the expected gratitude for supplying their needs argues for spiritual adultery. However, the reference to prostitution in the next line and the reference to chasing after their neighbor's wives argues for literal adultery. The translation opts for spiritual adultery because of the contrast implicit in the concessive clause.<br>
 <a name="fn268" href="jer.htm#fnB268"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:7)  There is a great deal of debate about the meaning of this word. Most of the modern translations follow the lead of lexicographers who relate this word to a noun meaning "troop" and understand it to mean "they trooped together" (cf. BDB 151 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dd~G&#180;</FONT> Hithpo.2 and compare the usage in Mic 5:1 [4:14 HT]). A few of the modern translations and commentaries follow the reading of the Greek and read a word meaning "they lodged" (reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wrr+oGt=y]</FONT> instead of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wdd&#180;G{t=y]</FONT> from I <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rWG</FONT> [cf. <i>HAL</i> 177 s.v. Hithpo. and compare the usage in 1 Kgs 17:20]). Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 180 sees a reference here to the cultic practice of cutting oneself in supplication to pagan gods (cf. BDB 151 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dd~G&#180;</FONT> Hithpo.1 and compare the usage in 1 Kgs 18:28). The houses of prostitutes would then be a reference to ritual prostitutes at the pagan shrines. The translation follows BDB and the majority of modern translations.<br>
 <a name="fn269" href="jer.htm#fnB269"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:7)  <i>Heb</i> "to a house of a prostitute."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (5:7)  This could be a reference to cultic temple prostitution connected with the pagan shrines. For allusion to this in the OT, see, e.g., Deut 23:17 and 2 Kgs 23:7.<br>
 <a name="fn270" href="jer.htm#fnB270"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:8)  The meanings of these two adjectives are uncertain. The translation of the first adjective is based on assuming that the word is a defectively written participle related to the noun "testicle" (a Hiphil participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yk!v!a&amp;m^</FONT>, from a verb related to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ev#a#</FONT>, "testicle" (cf. Lev 21:20) and hence "having testicles" (cf. <i>HAL</i> 1379 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hk*v*</FONT>) instead of the Masoretic form<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> &lt;yK!v=m^</FONT> from a root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hk*v*</FONT> which is otherwise unattested in either verbal or nominal forms). The second adjective is best derived from a verb root meaning "to feed" (a Hophal participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yn]z&#180;Wm</FONT> (the Kethib) from a root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/Wz</FONT> (cf. BDB 266 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/Wz</FONT>) for which there is the cognate noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ozm*</FONT> [cf. 2 Chr 11:23]). This is more likely than the derivation from a root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/z~y&#180;</FONT> (reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yn]Z&#180;y%m=</FONT>, a Pual participle with the Qere) which is otherwise unattested in verbal or nominal forms and whose meaning is dependent only on a supposed Arabic cognate (cf. <i>HAL</i> 387 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/z~y&#180;</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn271" href="jer.htm#fnB271"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:8)  <i>Heb</i> "neighs after."<br>
 <a name="fn272" href="jer.htm#fnB272"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:10)  Literally , "through her vine rows and destroy." No object is given but "vines" must be implicit. The word for "vineyards" (or "vine rows") is a <i>hapax legomenon</i> and its derivation is debated. BDB 1004 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hr&#180;WV</FONT> repoints <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">h*yt#orv*</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">h*yt#orv%</FONT> and relates it to a Mishnaic Hebrew and Palestinian Aramaic word meaning "row." <i>HAL</i> 1348 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hr&#180;WV</FONT> also repoint to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">h*yt#orv%</FONT> and relate it to a noun meaning "wall", preferring to see the reference here to the walled terraces on which the vineyards were planted. The difference in meaning is minimal.<br>
 <a name="fn273" href="jer.htm#fnB273"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:10)  In the light of the context and Jeremiah's identification of Israel as a vine (cf., e.g., 2:21) and a vineyard (cf., e.g., 12:10), it is likely that this verse has a totally metaphorical significance. The enemy is to go through the vineyard that is Israel and Judah and destroy all those who have been unfaithful to the LORD. It is not impossible, however, that the verse has a double meaning, a literal one and a figurative one: the enemy is not only to destroy Israel and Judah's vines but to destroy Israel and Judah, lopping off the wicked Israelites who, because of their covenant unfaithfulness, the LORD has disowned. If the verse is totally metaphorical one might translate: "Pass through my vineyard, Israel and Judah, wreaking destruction. But do not destroy all of the people. Cut down like branches those unfaithful people because they no longer belong to the LORD."<br>
 <a name="fn274" href="jer.htm#fnB274"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:12)  <i>Heb</i> "have denied the LORD." The words "What...says" are implicit in what follows.<br>

 <a name="fn277" href="jer.htm#fnB277"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:13)  <i>Heb</i> "will be wind."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (5:13)  There is a wordplay on the Hebrew word translated "wind" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">j^Wr</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">rW^j</FONT>) which also means "spirit." The prophets spoke by inspiration of the Spirit of the LORD (cf. e.g., 2 Chr 20:14); hence the prophet was sometimes called "the man of the spirit," (cf. Hos 9:7). The people were claiming that the prophets were speaking lies and hence were full of wind, not the Spirit.<br>
 <a name="fn278" href="jer.htm#fnB278"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tc</b> (5:13)  <i>Heb</i> "the word is not in them." The MT has a highly unusual form here, the Piel perfect with the definite article (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rB@D]h^</FONT>).

 <a name="fn293" href="jer.htm#fnB293"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:19)  The word, "Jeremiah," is not in the text but the second person address in the second half of the verse is obviously to him. The word is supplied in the translation here for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn294" href="jer.htm#fnB294"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:19)  The MT reads the second masculine plural here; this is probably a case of attraction to the second masculine plural pronoun in the preceding line. An alternative would be to understand a shift from speaking first to the people in the first half of the verse and then speaking to Jeremiah in the second half where the verb is second masculine singular. E.g., "When you [people] say, "Why...?", then you, Jeremiah, tell them..." This is not impossible, but it is awkward in English.<br>
 <a name="fn295" href="jer.htm#fnB295"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:19)  <i>Heb</i> "As you left me and..., so you will...." The translation was chosen so as to break up a rather long and complex sentence.<br>
 <a name="fn296" href="jer.htm#fnB296"><sup>56</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:19)  This is probably a case of deliberate ambiguity (double entendre). The adjective "strangers" is used for both foreign people (so Jer 30:8; 51:51) and foreign gods (so Jer 2:25; 3:13). See also Jer 16:13 for the idea of having to serve other gods in the lands of exile.<br>

 <a name="fn305" href="jer.htm#fnB305"><sup>65</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:26)  The meaning of the last three words is somewhat uncertain. The pointing and meaning of the Hebrew word rendered here "hiding in ambush" is greatly debated. BDB relate the form here (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ev^K=</FONT>) to a root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ek^v*</FONT> which elsewhere means "decrease, abate" (cf. BDB 1013 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ek^v*</FONT>) and say this is usually understood to mean "like the crouching of fowlers"; but they say this meaning is dubious. <i>HAL</i> questions the validity of the text and offers three proposals, the second of which appears to create the least textual modification, i.e. reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ec^K=</FONT> "as in the hiding place of (bird catchers)" (cf. <i>HAL</i> 1345 s.v. I <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rov</FONT>; for the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ec</FONT> see <i>HAL</i> 1236 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ec</FONT> 4 and compare Lam 2:6 for usage). The versions do not help here. The Greek does not translate the first two words of the line. The proposal given in <i>HAL</i> is accepted here with some hesitancy.<br>
 <a name="fn306" href="jer.htm#fnB306"><sup>66</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:26)  Literally "a destroying thing."<br>

 <a name="fn311" href="jer.htm#fnB311"><sup>71</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:28)  The meaning of this final word is uncertain. This verb occurs only here. The lexicons generally relate it to the word which is translated "plate" in Song 5:14 and see it as meaning "smooth, shiny" (so BDB 799 s.v. I <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tv#u#</FONT>) or "fat" (so <i>HAL</i> 850 s.v. II <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tv#u#</FONT>). The word in Song 5:14 more likely means "smooth" than "plate" (so TEV). So the idea of "sleek" would appear most likely. However, since both words only occur once there can be little certainty.<br>
 <a name="fn312" href="jer.htm#fnB312"><sup>72</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:28)  <i>Heb</i> "they cross over/transgress with respect to matters of evil."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (5:28)  There is undoubtedly a wordplay here in the use of this word which has twice been applied in v. 22 to the sea not crossing the boundary set for it by God.<br>
 <a name="fn313" href="jer.htm#fnB313"><sup>73</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:29)  These words are repeated from 5:9 to give a kind of refrain justifying again the necessity of punishment in the light of such sins.<br>
 <a name="fn314" href="jer.htm#fnB314"><sup>74</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:31)  There is a good deal of disagreement about the meaning of this line. The Hebrew text reads, "they shall rule at their hands." Since the word "hand" can be used figuratively for authority or mean "side" and the pronoun "them" can refer to the priests themselves or the prophets, the following translations have also been suggested: "the priests rule under their [the prophets'] directions," or "the priests rule in league with them [the prophets]." From the information in the rest of the book it would appear that the prophets did not exercise authority over the priests nor did they exercise the same authority over the people that the priests did. Hence it probably mean "by their own hand/power/authority."<br>
 <a name="fn315" href="jer.htm#fnB315"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:1)  <i>Heb</i> "Flee for safety, people of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem."<br>

 <a name="fn316" href="jer.htm#fnB316"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:1)  <i>Heb</i> "ram's horn," but the modern equivalent is "trumpet" and is more readily understandable.<br>
 <a name="fn317" href="jer.htm#fnB317"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (6:1)  This passage is highly emotionally charged. There are two examples of assonance or wordplay in the verse-- "sound" (Heb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">T!q=uW</FONT>, "blow,") which has the same consonants as "Tekoa" (Heb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">b!t=qou^</FONT>) and "signal fire" which comes from the same root as "light" (Heb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">c=aW m^ca@t</FONT>, "lift up")--and an example of personification where disaster is said to "lurk" (<i>Heb</i> "look down on") out of the north. The intent is to give a sense of urgency and concern for the imminency of the coming destruction.<br>
 <a name="fn318" href="jer.htm#fnB318"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:2)  The verb here is another example of the Hebrew verb form that indicates the action is as good as done (a Hebrew prophetic perfect).<br>

 <a name="fn320" href="jer.htm#fnB320"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:2)  <i>Heb</i> "The beautiful and delicate one I will destroy, the daughter of Zion. The translations and commentaries are divided over the rendering of this verse. That is because there are two verbs with these same consonants, one meaning "to be like" and the other meaning "to be destroyed" (intransitive) or "to destroy" (transitive), and the word rendered here "beautiful" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hw&#180;n&#180;</FONT>) can be understood as a noun meaning "pasture" or as a defective writing of an adjective meaning "beautiful, comely" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hw&#180;an&#180;</FONT>). Hence some render "Fair Zion, you are like a lovely pasture," reading the verb form as an example of the old second feminine singular perfect. However, though this may fit in well with the imagery of the next verse, that rendering must ignore the absence of a preposition, "to" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l=</FONT> or <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la#</FONT>) that normally goes with the verb "be like" and drop the conjunction in front of the adjective "delicate." The parallel usage of the verb in Hos 4:5 argues for the meaning "destroy."<br>

For the use of "shepherds" to refer to rulers see BDB 945 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hu*r&#180;</FONT> 1.d(2) and compare Jer 12:10.

 <b>sn</b> (6:3)  There is a continued use of the wordplay involving "sound...in Tekoa" mentioned in the study note on "destruction" in v. 1.

The Hebrew text presents two anomalies here: a masculine singular verb with a feminine singular subject in a verbal stem (Hophal) that elsewhere does not have the meaning "is to be punished." Hence many follow the Greek which presupposes <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rq#V#h^ ryu! yoh</FONT> instead of<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> dq^p=h*</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ryu!h* ayh!</FONT>. The Greek is obviously the easier reading in light of the parallelism, and it would be hard to explain how the Masoretic text arose from it. KBL suggests reading a noun meaning "licentiousness" which occurs elsewhere only in Mishnaic Hebrew, hence "this is the city, the licentious one" (attributive apposition; cf. KBL 775 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rq#P#</FONT>). Perhaps the Hophal perfect (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dq^p=h*</FONT>) should be revocalized as a Niphal infinitive absolute (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dq)P*h!</FONT>); this would solve both of the anomalies in the Masoretic text since the Niphal is used in this nuance and the infinitive absolute can function in place of a finite verb (cf. GKC &#167;&#167;113.<i>ee</i> and <i>ff</i>). This, however, is mere speculation and is supported by no Hebrew MS.<br>

 <a name="fn361" href="jer.htm#fnB361"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:18)  The meaning of this line is somewhat uncertain. The Hebrew text reads, "Know, congregation [or, witness], what in [or, against] them." The meaning of the noun of address in the second line (i.e., "witness", rendered as an imperative in the translation, "Be witnesses") is greatly debated. It is often taken as the word "congregation" but the lexicons and commentaries generally question the validity of reading that word here since it is nowhere else applied to the nations. BDB 417 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hd&#180;u@</FONT> 3 says that the text is dubious. <i>HAL</i> 747 s.v. I <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hd&#180;u@</FONT>, 4 emends the text to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hu*D}</FONT>. Several of the modern translations (e.g., NIV, NCV, God's Word) appear to take the word as the feminine singular noun, "witness" (cf. BDB 729 s.v.

This solution is also proposed by Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 259, fn 3 and appears to make the best sense in the context.

The best example of its figurative use of loss of strength or the feeling of helplessness is in Ezek 21:12 where it appears in the context of the heart (courage) melting, the spirit sinking, and the knees becoming like water. For other examples of this figurative use compare 2 Sam 4:1; Zeph 3:16. In Neh 6:9 it is used literally of the builders "dropping their hands from the work" out of fear.

 <a name="fn382" href="jer.htm#fnB382"><sup>68</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:27)  The meaning of these two lines is somewhat uncertain. The assumption underlying the translation is that the line reads in Hebrew, "I appoint you an assayer among my people, a tester." Uncertainty is created by the debate over the meaning of the words translated "assayer" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ojB*</FONT> ) and "tester" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rx*b=m!</FONT> ). The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ojB*</FONT> can mean either "tower" (cf. BDB 103 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ojB*</FONT> and see Isa 23:13 for the only other use) or "assayer" (cf. BDB 103 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ojB*</FONT>). The latter would be the more expected nuance because of the other uses of nouns and verbs from this root. The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rx*b=m!</FONT> normally means "fortress" (cf. BDB 131 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rx*b=m!</FONT>), but most modern commentaries and lexicons deem that nuance inappropriate here. <i>HAL</i> follows a proposal that the word is to be repointed to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rX@b^m=</FONT> and is to be derived from a root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rx^B*</FONT> meaning "to test" (cf. <i>HAL</i> 143 s.v.

That proposal makes the most sense in the context, but it should be noted that the word or the verb to which it is related appear nowhere else in the OT.<br>

Here Jeremiah says that the lead has been used up and the impurities have not been removed.

Elsewhere triple repetition seems to mark a kind of emphasis (cf. Isa 6:3; Jer 22:29; Ezek 21:27 [32 HT]). The triple repetition that follows seems to be Jeremiah's way of mocking the (false) sense of security that people had in the invincibility of Jerusalem because God dwelt in the temple. They appeared to be treating the temple as though it were some kind of magical charm. A similar feeling had grown up around the ark in the time of the judges (cf. 1 Sam 3:3) and the temple and city of Jerusalem in Micah's day (cf. Mic 3:11).

Verses 9-10 are all one long sentence in the Hebrew text. It has been broken up for English stylistic reasons. Somewhat literally it reads "Will you steal...then come and stand...and say, `We are safe' so as to/in order to do..." The translation tries to capture in contemporary English style some of the same rhetorical flavor of the Hebrew style. The Hebrew of v. 9 has a series of infinitives which emphasize the bare action of the verb without the idea of time or agent. The effect is to place a kind of staccato like emphasis on the multitude of their sins all of which are violations of one of the Ten Commandments. The final clause in v. 8 expresses purpose or result (probably result here) through another infinitive. All of this long sentence is introduced by a marker (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">h</FONT> interrogative in Hebrew) introducing a rhetorical question in which God expresses his incredulity that they could do the sins cataloged in v. 9, come into the temple and claim the safety of his protection, and then go right back out and commit the same sins. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 52 catches the force nicely : "What? You think you can steal, murder...and then come and stand...and say, `We are...' just so that you can go right on..." But this is too long for contemporary English style.<br>

Though the literal translation is the traditional rendering accepted by most ancient and modern translations, it will make little sense to many modern readers who have not grown up in the Jewish or Christian tradition. The translation proposed is an accommodation to the modern reader and perhaps does not adequately represent the theology underlying the literal translation which involves the LORD's deliberate identification with a place because that is where he chose to manifest his presence and desired to be worshiped (cf. Exod 20:25; Deut 16:2, 6, 11).<br>

The incident referred to is the destruction of Shiloh by the Philistines circa 1050 B.C. This is also alluded to in Ps 78:60. The destruction of Shiloh is pertinent to the argument here. The presence of the tabernacle and the ark of the covenant did not prevent the city of Shiloh from being destroyed. The people of Israel used the ark as a magic charm but it did not prevent them from being defeated or the ark being captured (see 1 Sam 4:3, 11, 21-22).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (7:18)  The <i>Queen of Heaven</i> is probably a reference to the goddess known as Ishtar in Mesopotamia, Anat in Canaan, Ashtoreth in Israel. She was the goddess of love and fertility.

For example, BDB 775 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/u^m^l=</FONT>, note 1, says that it always denotes purpose, never result, but that sometimes what is really a result is represented ironically as though it were a purpose.

 <b>sn</b> (7:21)  All of the burnt offering, including the meat, was to be consumed on the altar (see, e.g., Lev 1:6-9). The meat of the other sacrifices could be eaten by human beings, the priest who offered the sacrifice and the person who brought it (see, e.g., Lev 7:16-18, 32). Since, however, the people of Judah were making a mockery of the sacrificial system by offering sacrifices while disobeying the law, the LORD rejected the sacrifices (see already 6:20). So they might as well go ahead and eat the meat dedicated to God as if it were their own share of the offering.<br>

However, it is better explained as an example of what Roland de Vaux calls a dialectical negative, i.e., "not so much this as that" or "not this without that" (cf. de Vaux, <i>Ancient Israel</i>, pp. 454-56). For other examples of this same argument see Isa 1:10-17; Hos 6:4-6; Amos 5:21-25.<br>

The two phrases used here appear nowhere else in the Bible and the latter preposition plus adverb elsewhere is used temporally meaning "formerly" or "previously." The translation follows the proposal of J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 57. Another option is "they turned their backs to me, not their faces," understanding the line as a variant of a line in 2:27.<br>
 <a name="fn439" href="jer.htm#fnB439"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:25)  <i>Heb</i> "from the day your ancestors...until this very day." However, "day" here is idiomatic for "the present time."<br>

The text reads merely "day" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;oy</FONT>). <i>BHS</i> suggests the word is to be deleted as a dittography of the plural ending of the preceding word. The word is in the Greek and Latin, and the Syriac represents the typical idiom "day after day" as though the noun were repeated.

There is a confusing interchange in the pronouns in vv. 25-26 which has led to some leveling in the ancient versions and the modern translations. What is involved here are four levels of referents, the "you" of the present generation (vv. 21-22a), the ancestors who were delivered from Egypt (i.e., the "they" of vv. 22b-24), the "you" of v. 25 which involves all the Israelites from the Exodus to the time of speaking, and the "they" of v. 26 which cannot be the ancestors of vv. 22-24 (since they cannot be more wicked than themselves) but must be an indefinite entity which is a part of the "you" of v. 25, i.e., the more immediate ancestors of the present generation. If this is kept in mind, there is no need to level the pronouns to "they" and "them" or to "you" and "your" as some of the ancient versions and modern translations have done.<br>

The address shifts from second masculine singular addressing Jeremiah (vv. 27-28a) to second feminine singular. It causes less disruption in the flow of the context to see the nation as a whole addressed here as a feminine singular entity (as, e.g., in 2:19, 23; 3:2, 3; 6:26) than to introduce a new entity, Jerusalem.<br>

Manasseh had desecrated the temple by building altars, cult symbols, and idols in it. Josiah had purged the temple of these pagan elements. But it is obvious from both Jeremiah and Ezekiel that they had been replaced shortly after Josiah's death. They were a primary cause of Judah's guilt and punishment (see beside this passage, 19:5; 32:34-35).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (7:31)  These <i>places of worship</i> were essentially open air shrines often located on hills or wooded heights. They were generally connected with pagan worship and equipped with altars of sacrifice and of incense and cult objects such as wooden poles and stone pillars which were symbols of the god and/or goddess worshiped at the sight. The Israelites were commanded to tear down these Canaanite places of worship (Num 33:52) but they did not do so, often taking over the site for the worship of Yahweh but even then incorporating some of the pagan cult objects and ritual into their worship of Yahweh (1 Kgs 12:31, 32; 14:23). The prophets were especially opposed to these places and to this kind of syncretism (Hos 10:8; Amos 7:9) and to the pagan worship that was often practiced at them (Jer 7:31; 19:5; 32:35). A good source for further information on the "high places" is the article on "High Place" in <i>The Illustrated Bible Dictionary</i>, 2:648-50.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (7:31)  The noun <i>Topheth</i> is generally explained as an artificial formation of a word related to the Aramaic word for "cooking stove" combined with the vowels for the word for "shame." Hence, Jewish piety viewed it as a very shameful act, one that was contrary to the law (see Lev 18:21; 20:2-6). Child sacrifice was practiced during the reigns of the wicked kings Ahaz and Manasseh and apparently during Jeremiah's day (cf. 2 Kgs 16:3; 21:6; Jer 32:35).<br>

However, it is possible that this is a case where the noun "Jerusalem" is a defining apposition to the word "these people," an apposition which GKC &#167;131.<i>k</i> calls "permutation." In this case the verb could be attracted to the appositional noun and there would be no reason to emend the text.

 <a name="fn472" href="jer.htm#fnB472"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:5)  There is a continuing play on the same root word used in the preceding verse. Here the words "turn away from me," "apostasy," and "turn back to me" are all forms from the root that was translated "go the wrong way" and "turn around" in v. 4. The intended effect is to contrast Judah's recalcitrant apostasy with the usual tendency to try and correct one's mistakes.<br>
 <a name="fn473" href="jer.htm#fnB473"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:6)  <i>Heb</i> "I have paid attention and I have listened." This is another case of two concepts being joined by "and" where one expresses the main idea and the other acts as an adverbial or adjectival modifier (a figure called hendiadys).<br>
 <a name="fn474" href="jer.htm#fnB474"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:6)  <i>Heb</i> "What have I done?" The addition of the word "wrong" is implicit in the context and is supplied in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn475" href="jer.htm#fnB475"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:6)  <i>Heb</i> "each one of them turns aside into their own running course."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (8:6)  The wordplay begun in v. 4 is continued here. The word translated "turns aside" in the literal translation and "wayward" in the translation is from the same root as "go the wrong way," "turn around," "turn away from me," "apostasy," "turn back to me." What God hoped for were confessions of repentance and change of behavior; what he got was denial of wrongdoing and continued turning away from him.<br>
 <a name="fn476" href="jer.htm#fnB476"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:7)  <i>Heb</i> "its appointed time." The translation is contextually motivated to avoid lack of clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn477" href="jer.htm#fnB477"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:7)  There is debate in the commentaries and lexicons about the identification of some of these birds, particularly regarding the identification of the "swallow" which is more likely the "swift" and the "crane" which some identify with the "thrush." For a discussion see the Bible encyclopedias and the UBS handbook <i>Fauna and Flora of the Bible</i>. The identity of the individual birds makes little difference to the point being made and "swallow" is more easily identifiable to the average reader than the "swift."<br>
 <a name="fn478" href="jer.htm#fnB478"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:7)  <i>Heb</i> "do not know." But here as elsewhere the word "know" is more than an intellectual matter. It is intended here to summarize both "know" and "follow" (<i>Heb</i> "observe") in the preceding lines.<br>
 <a name="fn479" href="jer.htm#fnB479"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:7)  <i>Heb</i> "the ordinance/requirement of the LORD."<br>

 <a name="fn482" href="jer.htm#fnB482"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:8)  <i>Heb</i> "The lying pen of the scribes have made [it] into a lie." The translation is an attempt to make the most common interpretation of this passage understandable for the average reader. This is, however, a difficult passage whose interpretation is greatly debated and whose syntax is capable of other interpretations. The interpretation of the NJPS, "Assuredly, for naught has the pen labored, for naught the scribes," surely deserves consideration within the context; i.e. it hasn't done any good for the scribes to produce a reliable copy of the law, which the people have refused to follow. That interpretation has the advantage of explaining the absence of an object for the verb "make" or "labored" but creates a very unbalanced poetic couplet.<br>
 <a name="fn483" href="jer.htm#fnB483"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:9)  <i>Heb</i> "be trapped." However, the word "trapped" generally carries with it the connotation of divine judgment. See BDB 540 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dk^l*</FONT> Niph 2, and compare usage in Jer 6:11 for support. The verbs in the first two lines are again the form of the Hebrew verb that emphasizes that the action is as good as done (Hebrew prophetic perfects).<br>
 <a name="fn484" href="jer.htm#fnB484"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:10)  See Jer 6:12-15 for parallels to 8:10-12.

 <a name="fn489" href="jer.htm#fnB489"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:13)  The meaning of this line is somewhat uncertain. Another possible rendering is: "I will completely destroy them." The translation which is adopted is based on the revocalization of the Masoretic text which appears to mean literally "gathering I will sweep them away," a rather improbable grammatical combination. It follows the suggestion found in <i>HAL</i> 705 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[Ws</FONT> (Hiph) of reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;p*ys!a&amp; [s@a)</FONT> (a first singular Qal imperfect of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[s^a*</FONT> followed by a noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[ys!a*</FONT> with possessive suffix) instead of the MT's <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;p@ys!a&amp; [s)a*</FONT> (a Qal infinitive absolute of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[s^a*</FONT> followed by the Hiphil imperfect of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[Ws</FONT> plus suffix). For parallel usage of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[s^a*</FONT> see BDB 62 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[s^a*</FONT> Qal 4 and for a similar form of the verb see Mic 4:6. The alternate translation follows the suggestion in BDB 692 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[Ws</FONT> Hiph, that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[s)a*</FONT> is to be interpreted as a form of the Hiphil infinitive absolute (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[s@h*</FONT> would be expected) chosen for assonance with the following form. This suggestion would gain more credence if the Masoretic text is to be retained in Zeph 1:2 where parallel forms are found. However, that text too has been questioned on lexical and grammatical grounds. The translation adopted fits the following context better than the alternate one and is based on less questionable lexical and grammatical parallels. The Greek translation which reads "they shall gather their fruits" supports the translation chosen.<br>
 <a name="fn490" href="jer.htm#fnB490"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:13)  The meaning of this line is very uncertain. A possible alternate translation is: "They have broken the laws that I gave them." The line reads rather literally "And I gave them they passed over them." The translation adopted treats the first expression as a noun clause (cf. GKC &#167;155.<i>n</i>) which is the subject of the following verb, i.e., "the things I gave them [contextually, the grapes, etc.] passed over from them." The alternate translation treats the expression as a dangling object (a Hebrew <i>casus pendens</i>) resumed by the pronoun "them" and understands "the things that I gave them" to be the law or some related entity which is often the object of this verb (see BDB 717 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rb^u*</FONT> Qal 1.i). Neither of these translations is without its weakness. The weakness of the translation which has been adopted is the unusual use it assigns to the object suffix of the verb translated "pass over." The weakness of the alternate translation is the rather abrupt and opaque introduction of a new topic of reference (i.e., the laws) into the context. On the whole the latter weakness would appear to outweigh the former. This line is missing from the Greek version and Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i>, and Thompson, <i>The Book of Jeremiah</i>, despair of giving a translation. For other possible suggestions see, Holladay, <i>Jeremiah 1</i>,<i> </i>285-86.<br>

The Masoretic text reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yt!yg]yl!b=m^</FONT> which BDB provisionally derives from a verb root meaning "to gleam" or "to shine." However, BDB notes that the text is dubious (cf. BDB 114 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tyg]yl!b=m^</FONT>). The text is commonly emended to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">th)G+ yl!B=m!</FONT> which is a Qal infinitive from a verb meaning "to heal" preceded by a compound negative "for lack of" "to be at a loss for" (cf. e.g., <i>HAL</i> 514 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tyg]yl!b=m^</FONT> and 174 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hhG</FONT>).

 <a name="fn509" href="jer.htm#fnB509"><sup>50</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:19)  The people's cry and the LORD's interruption reflect the same argument that was set forth in the preceding chapter.

For <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ud~y&#180;</FONT> meaning "acknowledge" see 1 Chr 28:9; Isa 29:21; Hos 2:20; Prov 3:6. This word is also found in ancient Near Eastern treaty contexts where it has the idea of a vassal king acknowledging the sovereignty of a greater king (cf. H.

The verbs are second masculine plural of direct address and there seems no way to translate literally and not give the mistaken impression that Jeremiah is being addressed.

Jeremiah, you live in the midst of deceitful people. They deceitfully refuse to take any thought of/acknowledge me." The translation which has been adopted is based on a redivision of the lines, a redivision of some of the words, and a revocalization of some of the consonants. The Masoretic text reads literally "doing wrong they weary themselves. Your sitting in the midst of deceit; in deceit they refuse to know me" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yt!oa-tu^d~ Wna&amp;m@ hm*r+m!B= hm*r+m! EotB= ;T=b=v! .Wal=n] hw}u&amp;h^</FONT>). The Greek version reads literally: "they do wrong and they do not cease to turn themselves around. Usury upon usury and deceit upon deceit. They do not want to know me." This suggests that one should read<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> Wal=n] hw}u&amp;h^ yt!oa tu^d~ Wna&amp;m@ hm*-r+m!B= hm*-r+m! EotB=</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ET) .bv%</FONT> which yields literally "doing evil [= "they do evil" using the Hiphil infinitive absolute as a finite verb (cf.

This reading has ancient support and avoids the introduction of an unexpected second masculine suffix into the context. It has been adopted here along with a number of modern commentaries (cf., e.g., McKane, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 1:201) and translations as the more likely reading.<br>

The Masoretic text does not have the word "wickedness." The word, however, is read in the Greek version. This is probably a case of a word dropping out because of its similarities to the consonants preceding or following it (i.e., haplography). The word "wickedness" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tu^r~</FONT>) has dropped out before the words "my dear people" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yM!u^-tB^</FONT>).<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> </FONT>The causal nuance which is normal for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn}P=m!</FONT> does not make sense without some word like this and the combination of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tu^r~</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn}P=m!</FONT> does occur in Jer 7:12 and one very like it occurs in Jer 26:3.<br>

The words are supplied in the translation for clarity and to help resolve a rather confusing issue of who is speaking throughout vv. 16-21. As has been evident throughout the translation, the speaker is not always indicated. Sometimes it is not even clear who the speaker is. In general the translation and the notes have reflected the general consensus in identifying who it is. Here, however, there is a good deal of confusion about who is speaking in vv. 18, 20-21. The Greek translation has the LORD speaking throughout with second plural pronouns in vv. 18, 21 and the absence of the first line in v. 22. It would be hard to explain how the Masoretic text arose if it were the original text. Critical commentators such as J. Bright, W. Holladay, and W. McKane resolve the issue by dropping out the introductory formula in v. 17 and the first line of v. 22 and assigning the whole lament to Jeremiah. It seems obvious from the first plural pronouns and the content of v. 18 (and probably v. 21 as well) and the fact that the LORD is referred to in other than the first person in v. 20 that he is not the speaker of those verses. I have attempted to resolve the issue by having Jeremiah report the LORD's command in v. 17 and have the rest of the speech be essentially that of Jeremiah. It should be admitted, however, that the issue is far from resolved. Most translations simply ignore the problem. The GNB (= TEV) is a rare exception.<br>

The text reads in Hebrew "because we have left our land because they have thrown down our dwellings." The two clauses offer parallel reasons for the cries "How ruined we are! [How] we are greatly disgraced!" But the first line must contain a prophetic perfect (because the lament comes from Jerusalem) and the second a perfect referring to a destruction that is itself future. This seems the only way to render the verse that would not be misleading.<br>
 <a name="fn568" href="jer.htm#fnB568"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:20)  The words "I said" are not in the text. The text merely has "Indeed, yes."

See the notes on 9:17-18 for further explanation.<br>
 <a name="fn569" href="jer.htm#fnB569"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:20)  It is a little difficult to explain how the Hebrew particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> is functioning here. Holladay,<i> Jeremiah</i>, 1:311 may be correct in seeing it as introducing the contents of what those who call for the mourning women are to say. In this case, Jeremiah picks up the task as representative of the people.<br>

Or "For death will climb...It will enter...It will take away...who gather in the city squares. So tell your daughters and neighbors, `The LORD wants you to say, "The dead bodies of people lie scattered...They lie scattered...has not been gathered."' The main causes of ambiguity are the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> introducing v. 21 and the verb form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rB@D~</FONT> at the beginning of v. 22. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> may be interpreted as introducing a causal sentence giving Jeremiah's grounds for the commands of v. 19 in which case the verbs would best be understood as prophetic perfects (as in the second alternate translation). Or it may be interpreted as introducing the content of the lament the women are to teach their daughters and neighbors (as in the translation adopted and in the first alternate translation). The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rB@D~</FONT> may be interpreted as a Piel masculine singular imperative addressed to Jeremiah (as in the first alternate translation where it is placed at the end for the sake of clarity) or as a Piel infinitive absolute either explaining what the woman are to teach their daughters and neighbors (as in the second alternate translation; cf. GKC &#167;113.<i>h</i>, <i>i</i> for this use of the infinitive absolute) or as equivalent to an imperative addressed to the women telling them to tell their daughters and neighbors the reason for the lament, i.e., the LORD's promise of widespread death (cf. GKC &#167;113.<i>bb</i> for this use of the infinitive absolute). The translation chosen has opted for v. 21 as the content of the lament and v. 22 as the further explanation that Jeremiah has the women pass on to their neighbors and daughters. This appears to this interpreter to create the least confusion and dislocation in the flow of the passage.<br>
 <a name="fn574" href="jer.htm#fnB574"><sup>56</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:23)  It is not always clear why verses were placed in their present position in the editorial process of collecting Jeremiah's sermons and the words the LORD spoke to him (see Jer 36:4, 32 for reference to two of these collections). Here it is probable that vv. 23-26 were added as a further answer to the question raised in v. 12.<br>

Verse 24 reads in Hebrew, "But let the one who brags brag in this: understanding and knowing me that I, the LORD, do faithfulness, justice, and righteousness in the earth for/that I delight in these." It is uncertain whether the Hebrew particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> before the clause "I delight in these things" is parallel to the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> introducing the clause "that I, the LORD, act..." or causal giving the grounds for the LORD acting the way he does. In the light of the contrasts in the passage and the emphasis that Jeremiah has placed on obedience to the covenant and ethical conduct in conjunction with real allegiance to the LORD not mere lip service, it is probable that the clauses are parallel. For the use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> to introduce clauses of further definition after a direct object as here see GKC &#167;117.<i>h</i> and see BDB 393 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ud~y&#180;</FONT> Qal 1.a.

Various proposals have been made to make sense out of this line, most of which involve radical emendation of the text. For some examples see Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i>, pp. 323-24, fn 6. However, this is probably a case of the bold predication that GKC discusses in &#167;141.<i>d</i>, some examples of which may be seen in Ps 109:4 "I am prayer," and Ps 120:7 "I am peace."<br>

Scholars debate the appropriateness of this verse to this context. Many see it as a gloss added by a post-exilic scribe which was later incorporated into the text. Both R. E. Clendenen, "Discourse Strategies in Jeremiah 10, " JBL 106 (1987): 401-8 and W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 1:324-25, 334-35 have given detailed arguments that the passage is not only original but the climax and center of the contrast between the LORD and idols in vv. 2-16. Holladay shows that the passage is a very carefully constructed chiasm (see accompanying study note) which argues that "these" at the end is the subject of the verb "will disappear" not the attributive adjective modifying heaven. He also makes a very good case that the verse is poetry and not prose as it is rendered in the majority of modern translations.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (10:11)  This passage is carefully structured and placed to contrast the LORD who is living and eternal (v. 10) and made the heavens and earth (v. 12) with the idols who did not and will disappear. It also has a very careful concentric structure in the original text where "the gods" is balanced by "these," "heavens" is balance by "from under the heavens," "the earth" is balanced by "from the earth," and "did not make" is balanced and contrasted in the very center by "will disappear." The structure is further reinforced by the sound play/wordplay between "did not make" (Aramaic <i>la' `abadu</i>) and "will disappear" (Aramaic <i>ye'badu</i>). This is the rhetorical climax of Jeremiah's sarcastic attack on the folly of idolatry.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (10:16)  The phrase <i>the portion of Jacob's descendants</i>, which is applied to God here, has its background in the division of the land where each tribe received a portion of the land of Palestine except the tribe of Levi whose "portion" was the LORD. As the other tribes lived off what their portion of the land provided, the tribe of Levi lived off what the LORD provided, i.e., the tithes and offerings dedicated to him. Hence to have the LORD as one's portion is to have him provide for all one's needs (see Ps 16:5 in the context of vv. 2, 6 and Lam 3:24 in the context of vv. 22-23).<br>
 <a name="fn614" href="jer.htm#fnB614"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:16)  <i>Heb</i> "The Portion of Jacob." "Descendants" is implied, and is supplied in the translation for clarity.<br>

 <a name="fn617" href="jer.htm#fnB617"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:17)  <i>Heb</i> "you who are living in/under siege." The pronouns in this verse are feminine singular in Hebrew. Jerusalem is being personified as a single woman. This personification carries on down through v. 19 where she speaks in the first person. It is difficult, however, to reflect this in a translation that conveys any meaning without being somewhat paraphrastic like this.<br>
 <a name="fn618" href="jer.htm#fnB618"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:18)  The meaning of this last line is somewhat uncertain: <i>Heb</i> "I will cause them distress in order that [or, with the result that] they will find." The absence of an object for the verb "find" has led to conjecture that the text is wrong. Some commentators follow the lead of the Greek and Latin versions which read the verb as a passive, "they will be found," i.e., be caught and captured. Others follow a suggestion by G.R. Driver ("Linguistic and Textual Problems: Jeremiah," JQR 28(1937/38):107) that the verb be read not as "they will find" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wax*m=y]</FONT> from<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> ax*m*</FONT>) but "they will be squeezed/drained" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wxm=y]</FONT> from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hx*m*</FONT>). The translation adopted assumes that this is an example of the ellipsis of the object supplied from the context (cf. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, pp. 8-12). For a similar nuance for the verb "find" = "feel/experience" see BDB 592 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ax*m*</FONT> Qal 1.f and compare the usage in Ps 116:3.<br>
 <a name="fn619" href="jer.htm#fnB619"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:19)  The words, "And I cried out" are not in the text. It is not altogether clear who the speaker is in vv. 19-25. The words of vv. 19-20 would best be assigned to a personified Jerusalem who laments the destruction of her city (under the figure of a tent) and the exile of her children (under the figure of children). However, the words of v. 21 which assign responsibility to the rulers do not fit well in the mouth of the people but do fit Jeremiah. The words of v. 22 are very appropriate to Jeremiah being similar to the report in 4:19-20. Likewise the words of v. 23 which appear to express man's incapacity to control his own destiny and his resignation to the fate which awaits him in the light of v. 24 seem more appropriate to Jeremiah than to the people. There has been no indication elsewhere that the people have shown any indication of being resigned to their fate or willing to accept their punishment. Though the issue is far from resolved a majority of commentators see Jeremiah as the speaker so identifying himself with their fate that he speaks as though he were this personified figure. It is not altogether out of the question, however, that the speaker throughout is personified Jerusalem though I know of no commentator who takes that view. For those who are interested, the most thorough discussion of the issue is probably to be found in W. McKane, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 1:230-35, especially 233-35. Rendering the pronouns throughout as "we" and "our" alleviates some of the difficulty but some speaker needs to be identified in the introduction to allay any possible confusion. Hence I have opted for what is the majority view.<br>
 <a name="fn620" href="jer.htm#fnB620"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:19)  <i>Heb</i> "Woe to me on account of my wound." The words "woe to" in many contexts carry the connotation of hopelessness and of inevitable doom (cf. 1 Sam 4:7, 8; Isa 6:5), hence a "deadly blow." See also the usage in 4:13, 31; 6:4 and the notes on 4:13. For the rendering of the pronoun as "we" and "our" here and in the verses to follow see the preceding note.<br>
 <a name="fn621" href="jer.htm#fnB621"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:19)  Some interpret this as a resignation to the punishment inflicted and translate "But I said, `This is my punishment and I will just have to bear it.'" This is unlikely given the meaning and usage of the word rendered "sickness" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yl!j(</FONT>), the absence of the pronoun "my," and the likelihood that the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ea^</FONT> means "only" not "indeed" (cf. BDB s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ea^</FONT> 2.b and compare its usage in v. 24).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (10:19)  What is being referred to here is the feeling that was encouraged by the false prophets that the ill fortunes of the nation were just temporary setbacks and everything would soon get better (cf. 6:14; 8:11).<br>
 <a name="fn622" href="jer.htm#fnB622"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:20)  <i>Heb</i> "My tent has been destroyed and my tent cords have been ripped apart." For a very similar identification of Jeremiah's plight with the plight of the personified community see 4:20 and the notes there.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (10:20)  What is being referred to is the exile of the people of the land. This passage could refer to the exiles of 605 B.C., 597 B.C., or more probably be anticipatory of the exile of 588 B.C. since the "tent," (i.e., the city) is pictured as torn down. The picture of devastation and desolation here should be contrasted with that in Isa 54:2-3.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (10:21)  The idiom translated <i>sought the </i>LORD<i>'s advice </i>quite commonly refers to inquiring for the LORD's guidance through a prophet. See for example Exod 18:15; 1 Sam 9:9; 1 Kgs 22:8. It would not exclude consulting the law.<br>

 <a name="fn636" href="jer.htm#fnB636"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:25)  <i>Heb</i> "who do not call on your name." The idiom "to call on your name" (directed to God) refers to prayer (mainly) and praise. See 1 Kgs 18:24-26 and Ps 116:13, 17. Here "calling on your name" is parallel to "acknowledging you." In many locations in the OT "name" is equivalent to the person. In the OT, the "name" reflected the person's character (cf. Gen 27:36; 1 Sam 25:25) or his reputation (Gen 11:4; 2 Sam 8:13). To speak in a person's name was to act as his representative or carry his authority (1 Sam 25:9; 1 Kgs 21:8). To call someone's name over something was to claim it for one's own (2 Sam 12:28).<br>
 <a name="fn637" href="jer.htm#fnB637"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:25)  <i>Heb</i> "have devoured Jacob."<br>
 <a name="fn638" href="jer.htm#fnB638"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:25)  Or "have almost completely destroyed them"; <i>Heb</i> "they have devoured them and consumed them." The figure of hyperbole is used here; elsewhere Jeremiah and God refer to the fact that they will not be completely consumed. See for example 4:27; 5:10, 18.<br>
 <a name="fn639" href="jer.htm#fnB639"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:1)  <i>Heb</i> "The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying." The proposed translation is more in keeping with contemporary English idiom. Cf. 1:2 and 7:1 and footnotes there.<br>
 <a name="fn640" href="jer.htm#fnB640"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:2)  The form is a second masculine plural which is followed in the Masoretic text of vv. 2-3 by second masculine singulars. This plus the fact that the whole clause "listen to the terms of this covenant" is nearly repeated at the end of v. 3 has led many modern scholars to delete the whole clause (cf., e.g. McKane,<i> Jeremiah</i>, 1:236-37). However, this only leads to further adjustments in the rest of the verse which are difficult to justify. The form has also led to a good deal of speculation about who these others were that are initially addressed here. The juxtaposition of second plural and singular forms has a precedent in Deuteronomy, where the nation is sometimes addressed with the plural and at other times with a collective singular. <br>
 <a name="fn641" href="jer.htm#fnB641"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (11:2)  <i>The agreement</i> [traditionally, "covenant"] <i>I made with Israel</i>. However, apart from the legal profession and Jewish and Christian tradition the term "covenant" may not be too familiar. There were essentially three kinds of "covenants" that were referred to under the Hebrew term used here: 1) "Parity treaties" or "covenants" between equals in which each party pledged itself to certain agreed upon stipulations and took an oath to it in the name of their god or gods (cf. Gen 31:44-54), 2) "Suzerain-vassal treaties" or "covenants" in which a great king pledged himself to protect the vassal's realm and his right to rule over his own domain in exchange for sovereignty over the vassal, including the rendering of absolute loyalty and submission to the great king's demands spelled out in detailed stipulations, 3) "Covenants of grant" in which a great king granted to a loyal servant or vassal king permanent title to a piece of land or dominion over a specified realm in recognition of past service. It is generally recognized that the Mosaic covenant which is being referred to here is of the second type and that it resembles in kind the ancient Near Eastern suzerain-vassal treaties. These treaties typically contained the following elements: 1) a preamble identifying the great king (cf. Exod 20:2a; Deut 1:1-4); 2) a historical prologue summarizing the great king's past benefactions as motivation for future loyalty (cf. Exod 20:2b; Deut 1:5-4:43); 3) the primary stipulation of absolute and unconditional loyalty (cf. Exod 20:3-8; Deut 5:1-11:32); 4) specific stipulations governing future relations between the vassal and the great king and the vassal's relation to other vassals (cf. Exod 20:22-23:33; Deut 12:1-26:15); 5) the invoking of curses on the vassal for disloyalty and the pronouncing of blessing on him for loyalty (cf. Lev 26; Deut 27-28); 6) the invoking of witnesses to the agreement often the great king's and the vassal's gods (cf. Deut 30:19; 31:28 where the reference is to the "heavens and the earth" as enduring witnesses). It is also generally agreed that the majority of the threats of punishment by the prophets refer to the invocation of these covenant curses for disloyalty to the basic stipulation, that of absolute loyalty. A good overview of the biblical covenants and their relation to the ancient Near Eastern treaties and covenants of grant is provided on p. 19 of the <i>NIV Study Bible</i>.<br>

 <a name="fn652" href="jer.htm#fnB652"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (11:4)  <i>Obey me and carry out the terms of the agreement...and I will be your God</i>. This refers to the Mosaic law which was instituted at Sinai and renewed on the Plains of Moab before Israel entered into the land. The words "the terms of the covenant" are explicitly used for the Ten Commandments in Exod 34:28 and for the additional legislation given in Deut 28:69; 29:8. The formulation here is reminiscent of Deut 29:9-14 (29:10-15 HT). The book of Deuteronomy is similar in its structure and function to an ancient Near Eastern treaty. In these the great king reminded his vassal of past benefits that he had given to him, charged him with obligations (the terms or stipulations of the covenant) chief among which was absolute loyalty and sole allegiance, promised him future benefits for obeying the stipulations (the blessings), and placed him under a curse for disobeying them. Any disobedience was met with stern warnings of punishment in the form of destruction and exile. Those who had witnessed the covenant were called in to confirm the continuing goodness of the great king and the disloyalty of the vassal. The vassal was then charged with a list of particular infringements of the stipulations and warned to change his actions or suffer the consequences. This is the background for Jer 11:1-9. Jeremiah is here functioning as a messenger from the LORD, Israel's great king, and charging both the fathers and the children with breach of covenant.<br>
 <a name="fn653" href="jer.htm#fnB653"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:5)  <i>Heb</i> "flowing with milk and honey." This phrase is very familiar to readers in the Jewish and Christian traditions as a proverbial description of the agricultural and pastoral abundance of the land of Israel. However, it may not mean too much to readers outside those traditions and an equivalent expression has been substituted for that reason. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, p. 626 identifies this as a figure of speech called synecdoche where the species is put for the genus, "a region...abounding with pasture and fruits of all kinds."<br>

There is an interesting polarity that is being exploited by two different nuances implicit in the use of the word "terms" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yr}b=D]</FONT>, literally "words"), i.e., what the LORD "brings on" them, namely, the curses that are the penalty for disobedience and the stipulations that they are "to do," that is, to carry out. The sentence is broken up this way in keeping with contemporary English style to avoid the long and complicated style of the original.<br>

 <a name="fn666" href="jer.htm#fnB666"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:13)  This is again an attempt to render the Hebrew particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> contextually. The nuance is a little hard to establish due to the nature of the rhetoric of the passage which utilizes the figure of apostrophe where the LORD turns from talking about Judah to addressing her directly, probably in condemnatory tones. Something like "the very idea that you should..." might best represent the mood. The <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> is probably asseverative or intensive (cf.

This passage involves a figure of speech where the speaker turns from describing something about someone to addressing him/her directly (a figure called apostrophe). This figure is not common in contemporary English literature or conversation and translating literally would lead to confusion on the part of some readers. Hence, the translation retains the third person in keeping with the rest of the context. The shift from singular "your cities" to plural "you have set up" is interpreted contextually to refer to a shift in addressing Judah to addressing the citizens of Jerusalem whose streets are being talked about. The appositional clause, "altars to sacrifice to Baal" has been collapsed with the preceding clause to better identify what the shameful thing is and to eliminate a complex construction. The length of this sentence runs contrary to the usual practice of breaking up long complex sentences in Hebrew into shorter equivalent ones in English. However, breaking up this sentence and possibly losing the connecting link with the preceding used to introduce it might lead to misunderstanding.<br>

 <a name="fn670" href="jer.htm#fnB670"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tc</b> (11:14)  The rendering "when disaster strikes them" is based on reading "at the time of" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tu@B=</FONT>) with a number of Hebrew MSS and the versions instead of "on account of" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">du^B=</FONT>). Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 1:347 is probably right in assuming that the Masoretic text has been influenced by "for them" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;d&#180;u&amp;b^</FONT>) earlier in the verse.<br>

The reference to Judah as his "beloved" is certainly ironic and perhaps even sarcastic.<br>
 <a name="fn673" href="jer.htm#fnB673"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tc</b> (11:15)  The meaning of this line is uncertain. The text reads somewhat literally either "her doing the wicked thing the many" or "doing it, the wicked thing, the many." The text, relationship between words, and meaning of this whole verse have been greatly debated. Wholesale emendation based on the versions is common in both the commentaries and the translations. Many follow the lead of the Greek version which in many cases offers a smoother reading but for that very reason may not be original. The notes that follow will explain some of these emendations but will also attempt to explain the most likely meaning of the Masoretic text which is the more difficult and probably the more original text. Since it is presumed to be the original the text will be dealt with in the notes line for line in the Masoretic text even though the emendations often relate to more than one line. For example the Greek of the first two lines reads: "Why has the beloved done abomination in my house?" This ignores the preposition before "my beloved" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yd]yd]yl!</FONT>) and treats the form "her doing" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ht*ocu&amp;</FONT>, Qal infinitive plus suffix) as a finite verb (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ht*c=u*</FONT>, Qal perfect third feminine). The forms are similar but the Greek is smoother. Moreover, it is difficult to explain the presence of "to" in the Masoretic text if the Greek is the original. The Greek text likewise does not have the difficulty that is exhibited in the Masoretic text by the word "the many" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yB!r~h*</FONT>). It reads a word for "vows/votive offerings" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eujcaiv </FONT>regularly = <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yr]d&#180;n+</FONT>) in place of the word "many" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yB!r~h*</FONT>) and takes it as part of a compound subject of the verb in the following line meaning "take away." However, this word is far removed graphically from that in the Masoretic text and it would be difficult to explain how the Masoretic text arose from it. The Old Latin apparently reads a word for "fat" (<i>adipes</i> = <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yb!l*j&amp;</FONT>) which is closer in script to the Masoretic text and would be more likely original than the Greek. However, both of these resolutions look like attempts to smooth out a difficult text. Because there is no solid support for any single reading, it is probably best to retain the MT's "the many." Many do retain it and take it as a second accusative of "doing it" and read "she does the wicked thing with many [i.e., many false gods]," a use of the accusative which is hard to justify. Another alternative, taking the adjective "the many" to modify the noun "the wicked thing" is sometimes suggested but is not possible because the adjective is masculine plural and the noun is feminine singular which is contrary to Hebrew style. Hence one cannot read "she has done many wicked things." The present translation follows the suggestion in the UBS, <i>Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Project</i>, 4:209 that it is the subject of the infinitive construct with an object suffix which is anticipatory of the noun "wickedness" that follows (cf. GKC &#167;131.<i>m</i>), i.e., "the many do it, namely the wickedness" (for the meaning of the noun see BDB 273 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hM*z]m=</FONT> 3.b).<br>
 <a name="fn674" href="jer.htm#fnB674"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:15)  The meaning of this line is also uncertain. The Hebrew text reads somewhat literally, "holy meat they pass over from upon you." The question of the subject of the verb is the main problem here. The verb is masculine plural and the only subject available is "holy meat" which is singular, a "they" which goes back to "the many," or a noun from the end of the preceding line which is combined with "holy meat." The latter is the solution of the Greek version which reads "Will votive offerings [or, pieces of fat (following the Old Latin)] and holy meats take away from you your wickedness?" However, that resolution has been rejected in the preceding note as smoothing out the difficulties of the first two lines. It also leaves out the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> at the beginning of the following line and takes the noun "your wickedness" as the object of the verb. That certainly would make for an easier reading of both this line and the next and the assumption that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> may not be in the text is possible because it could be explained as a double writing of the pronoun on the end of the preceding phrase "from upon you" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ey]l*u*m@</FONT>). However, besides being the smoother reading it leaves the last line too short poetically. The solution of the UBS, <i>Preliminary Report</i>, 4:209 is that "they" (referring back to "the many"?) is the subject. They read: "so that they carry away from you even sacrificial flesh." But who are "they" and "you?" Is the "they" the priests and the "you" the people? (See 1 Sam 2:10-17 for a possible parallel.) This, however, introduces too many unknowns into the text. The translation adopted is based on a revocalization of the form "from upon you" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ey]l*u*m@</FONT>) to "your treacherous acts" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ey]l*u&amp;m^</FONT>; for this noun cf. BDB 591 s.v. I <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu^m^</FONT> 2), a solution which is also proposed in the margin of the NJPS which reads: "Can your treacheries be canceled by sacral flesh?" For the nuance of the verb presupposed here (= be removed, cease to exist) see BDB 718 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rb^u*</FONT> Qal 6.c and compare usage in Job 30:15. While this solution does preserve the consonantal text and is accepted here, it should be acknowledged that there is no ancient support for it and the reading of the noun "treacheries" in place of the compound preposition "from upon" is purely speculative.<br>
 <a name="fn675" href="jer.htm#fnB675"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:15)  The meaning of this line is also uncertain: <i>Heb </i>"for [or when] your wickedness then you rejoice." The Greek translation which reads "or will you escape by these things" (presupposing a Hebrew text<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> yz]WuT* toz lu^ &lt;a!</FONT>?) is far removed from the reading in the Masoretic text (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yz]Ou&amp;T^ za*</FONT>; the rest of the Hebrew line has been left out because the Greek reads it with the preceding line) and again appears to be an attempt to smooth out a difficult text. The translation retains the Masoretic text but rewords it so it makes better sense in English. The translation presupposes that the phrase "your wickedness" is the object of the verb "take joy" and the adverb "then" refers back to the offering of sacred flesh, i.e., "even then [or, at that time]" as a <i>constructio ad sensum</i>. For a similar use of the adverb (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">za*</FONT>) compare Gen 13:7. For the use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> meaning "that" after a question see BDB 472 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> 1.f. A possible alternative would be to read as UBS, <i>Preliminary Report</i>, 4:209 do: "When trouble reaches you, then will you exult?" If the text of the whole verse followed here, the more difficult text, is not the original one, the most likely alternative would be: "What right does my beloved have to be in my house? She has does wicked things [reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tM)z]m= ht*c=u*</FONT>]. Can fat pieces [reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yb!l*j&amp;h^</FONT>] and sacred meat take away your wickedness from you [reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk!t@u*r&#180; Ey]l^u*m@</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wrb!u&amp;y~</FONT>]. [If it could] then you could rejoice." It should be emphasized that the text of the verse is uncertain in a number of places and open to more than one interpretation. However, regardless of which text or interpretation of it is followed, the Masoretic as interpreted here, the Greek as given in the notes, or an emended text based on both, the overall meaning is much the same. Judah has done evil and the LORD rejects their superficial attempts to placate him through ritual without change of behavior. The particulars are different; the point is the same.<br>

This is another example of the rapid shift in person that is common to Hebrew style which is not common in English and could lead to confusion for some readers.

 <a name="fn677" href="jer.htm#fnB677"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:16)  The verb form used here is another example of a verb expressing that the action is as good as done (the Hebrew prophetic perfect).<br>

For the shift from third person "he" to the first person "I" see the preceding note. The Hebrew use of the pronouns in vv. 16-17 for the olive tree and the people that it represents is likely to cause confusion if retained. In v. 16 the people are "you" and the olive tree is "it." The people are again "you" in v. 17 but part of the metaphor is carried over, i.e., "he `planted' you." It creates less confusion in the flow of the passage if the metaphorical identification is carried out throughout by addressing the people/plant as "you."<br>
 <a name="fn679" href="jer.htm#fnB679"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:16)  The verb here has most commonly been derived from a root meaning "to be broken" (cf. BDB 949 s.v.

Another common option is to emend it to a verb meaning "to be burned up" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ru^B*</FONT>). However, it is better to follow the lead of the Greek version which translates "be good for nothing" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hjcreiwvqhsan</FONT>) and derive the verb from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">uu^r&#180;</FONT> meaning "be bad/evil" (cf. BDB 949 and compare the nuance of the adjective from this verb in BDB 948 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ur~</FONT> 5).<br>

 <a name="fn684" href="jer.htm#fnB684"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:18)  <i>Heb</i> "caused me to know that I might know." Many translations supply an unstated object "their plots" which is referred to later in the context (cf. v. 19). The presupposition of this kind of absolute ellipsis is difficult to justify and would create the need for understanding an ellipsis of "it" also after "I knew." It is better to see a bipolar use of the verb "know" here. For the second use of the verb "know" meaning "have understanding" see BDB 394 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ud~y&#180;</FONT> Qal 5.<br>
 <a name="fn685" href="jer.htm#fnB685"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:18)  <i>Heb</i> "Then you showed me their deeds." This is another example of the rapid shift in person which is common in Jeremiah. As elsewhere, it has been resolved for the sake of avoiding confusion for the English reader by leveling the referent to the same person throughout. The text again involves an apostrophe, talking about the LORD to addressing him.<br>

Though this fits the context nicely the emendation is probably unnecessary since the word "bread" is sometimes used of other foodstuff than grain or its products (cf. BDB 537 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;j#l#</FONT> 2.a).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (11:19)  The word <i>fruit</i> refers contextually here to the prophecies that Jeremiah was giving, not (as some suppose) his progeny. Jeremiah was not married and had no children.<br>

The sentence has been broken up to avoid a long and complex English sentence. The translation is more in keeping with contemporary English style. In Hebrew thought the "kidneys" were thought of as the seat of the emotions and passions and the "heart" was viewed as the seat of intellect, conscience, and will. The "heart" and the "kidneys" are often used figuratively for the thoughts, emotions, motives, and drives that are thought to be seated in them.<br>

This phrase is anticipatory of the same phrase at the beginning of v. 22 and is introductory to what the LORD says about them. The translation seeks to show the connection of the "therefore" which is sometimes rather loose (cf.

Here the parallelism argues that it refers to the nation of Judah. The translation throughout vv. 5-17 assumes that the verb forms are prophetic perfects, the form that conceives of the action as being as good as done. It is possible that the forms are true perfects and refer to a past destruction of Judah. If so, it may have been connected with the assaults against Judah in 598/7 B.C. by the Babylonians and the nations surrounding Judah recorded in 2 Kgs 24:14. No other major recent translation reflects these as prophetic perfects besides the NIV and the NCV, which does not use the future until v. 10. Hence the translation is somewhat tentative. C. Feinberg, "Jeremiah," <i>EBC</i>, 6:459 takes them as prophetic perfects and H. Friedman, <i>Jeremiah</i>, Soncino, p. 88 mentions that as a possibility for explaining the presence of this passage here. For another example of an extended use of the prophetic perfect without imperfects interspersed see Isa 8:23-9:6. The translation assumes they are prophetic and are part of the LORD's answer to the complaint about the prosperity of the wicked; both the wicked Judeans and the wicked nations God will use to punish them will be punished.<br>

The word "hate" is sometimes used in a figurative way to refer to being neglected, i.e., treated as though unloved. In these contexts it does not have the same emotive connotations that a typical modern reader would associate with hate. See Gen 29:31, 33 and Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, p. 556.<br>
 <a name="fn732" href="jer.htm#fnB732"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:9)  Or "like speckled birds of prey." The meanings of these words are uncertain. In the Hebrew text sentence is a question: "Is not my inheritance to me a bird of prey [or] a hyena/a speckled bird of prey?" The question expects a positive answer and so is rendered here as an affirmative statement. The meaning of the word "speckled" is debated. It occurs only here. BDB 840 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">u^Wbx*</FONT> relates it to another word that occurs only once in Judg 5:30 which is translated "dyed stuff." <i>HAL</i> 936 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">u^Wbx*</FONT> relates a word found in the cognates meaning "hyena." This is more likely and is the interpretation followed by the Greek which reads the first two words as "cave of hyena." This translation has led some scholars to posit a homonym for the word "bird of prey" meaning "cave" which is based on Arabic parallels. The metaphor would then be of Israel carried off by hyenas and surrounded by birds of prey. The evidence for the meaning "cave" is weak and would involve a wordplay of a rare homonym with another word that is better known. For a discussion of the issues see J. Barr, <i>Comparative Philology and the Text of the Old Testament</i>, pp. 128-29, 153.<br>
 <a name="fn733" href="jer.htm#fnB733"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:9)  <i>Heb</i> "Are birds of prey around her?" The question is again rhetorical and expects a positive answer. The birds of prey are of course the hostile nations surrounding her. The metaphor involved in these two lines may be interpreted differently. I.e., God considers Israel a proud bird of prey (hence the word for speckled) but one who is surrounded and under attack by other birds of prey. The fact that the sentences are divided into two rhetorical questions speaks somewhat against this.<br>
 <a name="fn734" href="jer.htm#fnB734"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:9)  <i>Heb</i> "Go, gather all the beasts of the field [= wild beasts]. Bring them to devour." The verbs are masculine plural imperatives addressed rhetorically to some unidentified group (the heavenly counsel?) Cf. the notes on 5:1 for further discussion. Since translating literally would raise question about who the commands are addressed to, they have been turned into passive third person commands to avoid confusion. The metaphor has likewise been turned into a simile to help the modern reader. By the way, the imperatives here implying future action argue that the passage is future and that it is correct to take the verb forms as prophetic perfects.<br>
 <a name="fn735" href="jer.htm#fnB735"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:10)  <i>Heb</i> "Many shepherds." For the use of the term "shepherd" as a figure for rulers see the notes on 10:21.<br>

To translate literally would presuppose an unlikely familiarity of this figure on the part of some readers. To translate as "vineyards" as some do would be misleading because that would miss the figurative nuance altogether.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (12:10)  The figure of Israel as God's vine and the land as God's vineyard is found several times in the Bible. The best known of these is the extended metaphor in Isa 5:1-7. This figure also appears in Jer 2:20. <br>

Some understand the homonym here meaning "it [the desolated land] will mourn to me." However, the only other use of the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu^</FONT> with this root means "to mourn over" not "to" (cf. Hos 10:5).

 <b>sn</b> (12:11)  There is a very interesting play on words and sounds in this verse that paints a picture of desolation and the pathos it evokes. Part of this is reflected in the translation. The same Hebrew word referring to a desolation or a waste (Heb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">v=m@m&amp;h</FONT>) is repeated three times at the end of three successive lines and the related verb is found at the beginning of the fourth (Heb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">n&#180;v^M*h</FONT>). A similar sounding word is found in the second of the three successive lines (Heb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">c*m*H</FONT> = "he [they] will make it"). This latter word is part of a further play because it is repeated in a different form in the last line (Heb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">c*&lt;</FONT> = "laying"); they lay it waste but no one lays it to heart. There is also an interesting contrast between the sorrow the LORD feels and the inattention of the people.<br>

Here and in Isa 34:6; Jer 47:6 it is symbolic of the enemy armies that the LORD uses to carry out destructive punishment against his enemies, hence the translation "his destructive weapon." A similar figure is use in Isa 10:5 where the figure is more clearly identified; Assyria is the rod/club that the LORD will use to discipline unfaithful Israel.<br>

 <a name="fn744" href="jer.htm#fnB744"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:13)  The pronouns here are actually second plural: <i>Heb</i> "Be ashamed/disconcerted because of your harvests." Because the verb form (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WvBoW</FONT>) can either be Qal perfect third plural or Qal imperative masculine plural many emend the pronoun on the noun to third plural (see, e.g., <i>BHS</i>). However, this is the easier reading and is not supported by either the Latin or the Greek which have second plural. This is probably another case of the shift from description to direct address that has been met with several times already in Jeremiah (the figure of speech called apostrophe; for other examples see, e.g., 9:4; 11:13). As in other cases the translation has been leveled to third plural to avoid confusion for the contemporary English reader. For the meaning of the verb here see BDB 101 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">voB</FONT> Qal 2 and compare the usage in Jer 48:13.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (12:14)  There appears to be an interesting play on the Hebrew word translated "uproot" in this verse. In the first instance it refers to "uprooting the nations from upon their lands," i.e., to exiling them. In the second instance it refers to "uprooting the Judeans from the midst of them," i.e., to rescue them.<br>

 <a name="fn756" href="jer.htm#fnB756"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:16)  The words "If they do this" are not in the text. They are part of an attempt to break up a Hebrew sentence which is long and complex into equivalent shorter sentences consistent with contemporary English style. Verse 16 in Hebrew is all one sentence with a long complex conditional clause followed by a short consequence: "If they carefully learn the ways of my people to swear by name, `By the life of the LORD,' as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then they will be built up in the midst of my people." The translation strives to create the same contingencies and modifications by breaking up the sentence into shorter sentences in accord with contemporary English style.<br>
 <a name="fn757" href="jer.htm#fnB757"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:16)  <i>Heb</i> "they will be built up among my people." The expression "be built up among" is without parallel. However, what is involved here is conceptually parallel to the ideas expressed in Isa 19:23-25 and Zech 14:16-19. That is, these people will be allowed to live on their own land, to worship the LORD there, and to come to Jerusalem to celebrate the feasts. To translate literally would be meaningless or misleading for many readers.<br>

Waltke and O'Connor (<i>IBHS</i> &#167;35.2.d, p. 590) are likely right in seeing the double infinitive construction here as an intensifying infinitive followed by an adverbial infinitive qualifying the goal of the main verb, "uproot it in such a way as to destroy it." However, to translate that way "literally" would not be very idiomatic in contemporary English. The translation strives for the equivalent. Likewise, to translate using the conditional structure of the original seems to put the emphasis of the passage in its context on the wrong point.<br>
 <a name="fn759" href="jer.htm#fnB759"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:1)  The term here (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">roza@</FONT>) has been rendered in various ways: "girdle" (KJV, ASV), "waistband" (NASB), "waistcloth" (RSV), "sash" (NKJV), "belt" (NIV), and "loincloth" (NRSV, NJPS, REB). The latter is more accurate according to the discussion in IDB, "Dress," 1:870, and Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>,1:399. It was a short, skirt like garment reaching from the waist to the knees and worn next to the body (cf. v. 9). See <i>The Illustrated Bible Dictionary</i>, "Dress," 1:394-95 for further details and illustration. The modern equivalent is "shorts" as in TEV/GNB.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (13:1)  The <i>linen shorts</i> (<i>Heb</i> "loincloth") were representative of Israel and the wearing of them was to illustrate the LORD's close relation to his people (v. 11). Since the priests' garments were to be made wholly of linen (cf. Exod 28; Ezek 44:17-18), the fact that the shorts were to be made of linen probably was to symbolize the nature of Israel's calling: they were to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (Exod 19:5-6). Just as the linen garments of the priest were to give him special honor and glory (Exod 28:40), so the linen garment was to be a source of praise and glory to the LORD (v. 11).<br>
 <a name="fn760" href="jer.htm#fnB760"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:1)  <i>Heb</i> "upon your loins." The "loins" were the midriff of the body from the waist to the knees. For a further discussion including the figurative uses see, IDB, "Loins," 3:149.<br>
 <a name="fn761" href="jer.htm#fnB761"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:1)  Or "Do not ever put them in water," i.e., "Do not even wash them."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (13:1)  The fact that the garment was not to be put in water is not explained. A possible explanation within the context is that it was to be worn continuously, not even taken off to wash it. That would illustrate that the close relationship that the LORD had with his people was continuous and indissoluble. Other explanations are that it was not to be gotten wet because (1) that would have begun the process of rotting (This assumes that the rotting was done by the water of the Euphrates. But it was buried in a crack in the rocks, not in the river itself); (2) that would have made it softer and easier to wear; or (3) that showed that the garment was new, clean, and fresh from the merchant. For this latter interpretation see J. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 64. For a fuller discussion of most of the issues connected with this acted out parable see W. McKane, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 1:285-92. However, the reason is not explained in the text and there is not enough evidence in the text to come to a firm conclusion, though the most likely possibility is that it was not to be taken off and washed but worn continuously.<br>

 <a name="fn767" href="jer.htm#fnB767"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:4)  There has been a great deal of debate about whether the place referred to here is a place (Parah, [= Perath] mentioned in Josh 18:23, modern Khirbet Farah, near a spring <i>`ain Farah</i>) about three and a half miles from Anathoth which was Jeremiah's home town or the Euphrates River. Elsewhere the word "Perath" always refers to the Euphrates but it is either preceded by the word "river of" or there is contextual indication that the Euphrates is being referred to. Because a journey to the Euphrates and back would involve a journey of more than 700 miles (1, 100 km) and take some months, scholars both ancient and modern have questioned whether "Perath" refers to the Euphrates here and if it does whether a real journey was involved. Most of the attempts to identify the place with the Euphrates involve misguided assumptions that this action was a symbolic message to Israel about exile or the corrupting influence of Assyria and Babylon. However, unlike the other symbolic acts in Jeremiah (and in Isaiah and Ezekiel) the symbolism is not part of a message to the people but to Jeremiah; the message is explained to him (vv. 9-11) not the people. In keeping with some of the wordplays that are somewhat common in Jeremiah it is likely that the reference here is to a place, Parah, which was near Jeremiah's hometown, but whose name would naturally suggest to Jeremiah later in the LORD's explanation in vv. 9-11 Assyria-Babylon as a place connected with Judah's corruption (see the notes on vv. 9-10). For further discussion the reader should consult the commentaries, especially W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 1:396 and W. McKane, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 1:285-292 who take opposite positions on this issue.<br>

 <a name="fn776" href="jer.htm#fnB776"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:9)  Many of the translations have erred in rendering this word "pride" or "arrogance" with the resultant implication that the LORD is going to destroy Israel's pride, i.e., humble them through the punishment of exile. However, BDB 144-45 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/oaG&#180;</FONT> 1 are more probably correct when they classify this passage among those that deal with the "`<i>majesty, excellence</i>' of nations, their wealth, power, magnificence of buildings...." The closest parallels to the usage here are in Zech 10:11 (parallel to scepter of Egypt); Psa 47:4 (47:5 HT; parallel to "our heritage" = "our land"); Isa 14:11 and Amos 8:7. The term is really further defined in v. 11 where it refers to their special relationship and calling. To translate it "pride" or "arrogance" also ruins the wordplay on "ruin" ("<i>nishkhat</i>" in v. 7 and "<i>`ahhkhit</i>" in v. 9).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (13:9)  Scholars ancient and modern are divided over the significance of the statement <i>I will ruin the highly exalted position in which Judah and Jerusalem take pride </i>(<i>Heb </i>"I will ruin the pride of Judah and Jerusalem"). Some feel that it refers to the corrupting influence of Assyria and Babylon and others feel that it refers to the threat of Babylonian exile. However, F. B. Huey, <i>Jeremiah-Lamentations</i>, 144 is correct in observing that the Babylonian exile did not lead to the rottenness of Judah, the corrupting influence of the foreign nations did. In Jeremiah's day these came through the age-old influences of the Canaanite worship of Baal but also the astral worship introduced by Ahaz and Manasseh. For an example of the corrupting influence of Assyria on Judah through Ahaz's political alliances see 2 Kgs 16 and also compare the allegory in Ezek 23:14-21. It was while the "linen shorts" were off Jeremiah's body and buried in the rocks that the linen shorts were ruined. So the LORD "ruined" the privileged status that resulted from Israel's close relationship to him (cf. v. 11). For the "problem" created by the LORD ruining Israel through corrupting influence compare the notes on Jer 4:10 and compare also passages like Isa 63:17 and Isa 6:10.<br>

It consists of a subject, "this wicked people" qualified by several "which" clauses preceding a conjunction and a form which would normally be taken as a third person imperative (a Hebrew jussive; <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yh!yw]</FONT>). This construction, called <i>casus pendens</i> by Hebrew grammarians, lays focus on the subject, here calling attention to the nature of Israel's corruption which makes it rotten and useless to God.

There may, by the way, be a pun being passed back and forth here involving the sound play been "fool" ("<i>nabal</i>") and "wine bottle" ("<i>nebel</i>").<br>
 <a name="fn787" href="jer.htm#fnB787"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:13)  The Greek version is likely right in interpreting the construction of two perfects preceded by the conjunction as contingent or consequential here, i.e., "and when they say...then say." See GKC &#167;159.<i>g</i>. However, to render literally would create a long sentence. Hence, the words "will probably" have been supplied in v. 12 in the translation to set up the contingency/consequential sequence in the English sentences.<br>
 <a name="fn788" href="jer.htm#fnB788"><sup>30</sup></a><b>sn</b> (13:13)  It is probably impossible to convey in a simple translation all the subtle nuances that are wrapped up in the words of this judgment speech. The word translated "stupor" here is literally "drunkenness" but the word has in the context an undoubted intended double reference. It refers first to the drunken like stupor of confusion on the part of leaders and citizens of the land which will cause them to clash with one another. But it also probably refers to the reeling under God's wrath that results from this (cf. Jer 25:15-29, especially vv. 15-16). Moreover there is still the subtle little play on wine jars. The people are like the wine jars which were supposed to be filled with wine. They were to be a special people to bring glory to God but they had become corrupt. Hence, like wine jars they would be smashed against one another and broken to pieces (v. 14). All of this, both "fill them with the stupor of confusion" and "make them reel under God's wrath," cannot be conveyed in one translation.<br>

 <a name="fn804" href="jer.htm#fnB804"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:18)  Or "You will come down from your thrones"; <i>Heb</i> "Make low! Sit!" This is a case of a construction where two forms in the same case, mood, or tense are joined in such a way that one (usually the first) is intended as an adverbial or adjectival modifier of the other (a figure called hendiadys). This is also probably a case where the imperative is used to express a distinct assurance or promise. See GKC &#167;110.<i>b</i> and compare the usage in Isa 37:30 and Psa 110:2.<br>

The translation is based on the parallel in Josh 6:1 where the very expression in the translation is used.

 <a name="fn809" href="jer.htm#fnB809"><sup>51</sup></a><b>sn</b> (13:19)  The statements are poetic exaggerations (hyperbole), as most commentaries note. Even in the exile of 587 B.C. not "all" of the people of Jerusalem or of Judah were exiled. Cf. the context of 2 Kgs 24:14-16 again.<br>
 <a name="fn810" href="jer.htm#fnB810"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:20)  The words "Then I said" are not in the text. They are supplied in the translation to show the shift in speaker from vv. 18-19 where the LORD is speaking to Jeremiah.<br>
 <a name="fn811" href="jer.htm#fnB811"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:20)  The word "Jerusalem" is not in the Hebrew text. It is added in the Greek text and is generally considered to be the object of address because of the second feminine singular verbs here and throughout the following verses. The translation follows the consonantal text (Kethib) and the Greek text in reading the second feminine singular here. The verbs and pronouns in vv. 20-22 are all second feminine singular with the exception of the suffix on the word "eyes" which is not reflected in the translation here ("Look up" = "Lift up your eyes") and the verb and pronoun in v. 23. The text may reflect the same kind of alternation between singular and plural that takes place in Isa 7 where the pronouns refer to Ahaz as an individual and his entourage, the contemporary ruling class (cf., e.g., Isa 7:4-5 [singular], 9 [plural], 11 [singular], 13-14 [plural]). Here the connection with the preceding may suggest that it is initially the ruling house (the king and the queen mother), then Jerusalem personified as a woman in her role as a shepherdess (i.e., leader). However, from elsewhere in the book the leadership has included the kings, the priests, the prophets, and the citizens as well (cf., e.g., 13:13). In v. 27 Jerusalem is explicitly addressed. It may be asking too much of some readers who are not familiar with biblical metaphors to understand an extended metaphor like this. If it is helpful to them, they may substitute plural referents for "I" and "me."<br>
 <a name="fn812" href="jer.htm#fnB812"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:20)  The word "enemy" is not in the text but is implicit. It supplied in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (13:20)  On the phrase <i>the enemy that is coming from the north</i> see Jer 1:14-15; 4:6; 6:1, 22; 10:22.<br>

 <a name="fn816" href="jer.htm#fnB816"><sup>58</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:21)  The words "The LORD" are not in the text. Some commentators make the enemy the subject, but they are spoken of as "them."<br>
 <a name="fn817" href="jer.htm#fnB817"><sup>59</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:21)  Or "to be rulers." The translation of these two lines is somewhat uncertain. The sentence structure of these two lines raises problems in translation. The Hebrew text reads: "What will you do when he appoints over you [or, punishes you (see BDB 823 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dq^P*</FONT> Qal B.2 for the former, Qal A.3 for the latter)] and you, yourself, taught them over you friends [or, chiefs (see BDB 48 s.v.

The translation assumes that the clause "and you, yourself, taught them [= made them accustomed, i.e., "prepared"] [to be] over you" is parenthetical coming between the verb "appoint" and its object and object modifier (i.e., "appointed over you allies for rulers"). A quick check of other translations will show how varied the translation of these lines has been. Most translations seem to ignore the second "over you" after "you taught them." Some translations rearrange the text to get what they think is a sensible meaning. For a fairly thorough treatment see W. McKane, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 1:308-10.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (13:21)  What is being alluded to here is the political policy of vacillating alliances through which Judah brought about her own downfall, allying herself first with Assyria, then Egypt, then Babylon, and then Egypt again. See 2 Kgs 23:29-24:7 for an example of this policy and the disastrous consequences.<br>
 <a name="fn818" href="jer.htm#fnB818"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:21)  <i>Heb</i> "Will not pain [here = mental anguish] take hold of you like a woman giving birth." The question is rhetorical expecting a positive answer.<br>

 <a name="fn820" href="jer.htm#fnB820"><sup>62</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:22)  <i>Heb</i> "Your skirt has been uncovered and your heels have been treated with violence." This is the generally accepted interpretation of these phrases. See, e.g., BDB 784 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bq@u*</FONT> a and <i>HAL</i> 329 s.v. I <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">sm^j*</FONT> Nif. The significance of the actions here are part of the metaphor (i.e., personification) of Jerusalem as an adulteress having left her husband and have been explained in the translation for the sake of readers unfamiliar with the metaphor.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (13:22)  The actions here were part of the treatment of an adulteress by her husband, intended to shame her. See Hos 2:3, 10 (2:5, 12 HT); Isa 47:4.<br>
 <a name="fn821" href="jer.htm#fnB821"><sup>63</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:22)  The translation has been restructured to break up a long sentence involving a conditional clause and an elliptical consequential clause. It has also been restructured to define more clearly what "these things" are. The Hebrew text reads: "And if you say, `Why have these things happened to me?' Because of the greatness of your iniquity your skirts [= what your skirt covers] have been uncovered and your heels have been treated with violence."<br>
 <a name="fn822" href="jer.htm#fnB822"><sup>64</sup></a><b>tn </b> (13:23) This is a common proverb in English coming from this biblical passage. For cultures where it is not proverbial perhaps it would be better to translate "Can black people change the color of their skin?" Strictly speaking these are "Cushites" inhabitants of a region along the upper Nile south of Egypt. The Greek text is responsible for the identification with Ethiopia. The term in Greek is actually a epithet = "burnt face."<br>
 <a name="fn823" href="jer.htm#fnB823"><sup>65</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:23)  <i>Heb</i> "Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? [Then] you also will be able to do good who are accustomed to do evil." The English sentence has been restructured and rephrased in an attempt to produce some of the same rhetorical force the Hebrew original has in this context.<br>
 <a name="fn824" href="jer.htm#fnB824"><sup>66</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:24)  The words, "The LORD says" are not in the text at this point. The words "an oracle of the LORD" does, however, occur in the middle of the next verse and it is obvious the LORD is the speaker. The words have been moved up from the next verse to enhance clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn825" href="jer.htm#fnB825"><sup>67</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:24)  <i>Heb</i> "them." This is another example of the rapid shift in pronouns seen several times in the book of Jeremiah. The pronouns in the preceding and the following are second feminine singular. It might be argued that "them" goes back to the "flock"/"sheep" in v. 20, but the next verse refers the fate described here to "you" (feminine singular). This may be another example of the kind of metaphoric shifts in referents discussed in the notes on 13:20 above. Besides, it would sound a little odd in the translation to speak of scattering one person like chaff.<br>
 <a name="fn826" href="jer.htm#fnB826"><sup>68</sup></a><b>sn</b> (13:24)  Compare the threat using the same metaphor in Jer 4:11-12.<br>
 <a name="fn827" href="jer.htm#fnB827"><sup>69</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:26)  <i>Heb</i> "over your face and your shame will be seen." The words "like a disgraced adulteress" are not in the text but are supplied in the translation to explain the metaphor. See the notes on 13:22.<br>
 <a name="fn828" href="jer.htm#fnB828"><sup>70</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:27)  <i>Heb</i> "Jerusalem." This word has been pulled up from the end of the verse to help make the transition. The words "people of" have been supplied in the translation here to ease the difficulty mentioned earlier of sustaining the personification throughout.<br>
 <a name="fn829" href="jer.htm#fnB829"><sup>71</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:27)  <i>Heb</i> "[I have seen] your adulteries, your neighings, and your shameless prostitution." The meanings of the metaphorical references have been incorporated in the translation for the sake of clarity for readers of all backgrounds.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (13:27)  The sentence is rhetorically loaded. It begins with three dangling objects of the verb all describing their adulterous relationship with the false gods under different figures and which are resumed later under the words "your disgusting acts." The Hebrew sentence reads: "Your adulteries, your neighings, your shameful prostitution, upon the hills in the fields I have seen your disgusting acts." This sentence drips with explosive disgust at their adulterous betrayal.<br>
 <a name="fn830" href="jer.htm#fnB830"><sup>72</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:27)  <i>Heb</i> "your disgusting acts." This word is almost always used of idolatry or of the idols themselves. See BDB 1055 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">JWQ%v!</FONT> and Deut 29:17 and Jer 4:1; 7:30.<br>

 <a name="fn832" href="jer.htm#fnB832"><sup>74</sup></a><b>sn</b> (13:27)  The form of Jer 14:1-15:9 is very striking rhetorically. It consists essentially of laments and responses to them. However, what makes it so striking is its deviation from normal form (cf. 2 Chr 20:5-17 for what would normally be expected). The descriptions of the lamentable situation come from the mouth of God <i>not</i> the people (cf.14:1-6, 17-18). The prophet utters the petitions with statements of trust (14:7-9, 19-22) and the LORD answers <i>not</i> with oracles promising deliverance but promising doom (14:10; 15:1-9). In the course of giving the first oracle of doom, the Lord commands Jeremiah not to pray for the people (14:11-12) and Jeremiah tries to provide an excuse for their actions (14:13). The LORD responds to that with an oracle of doom on the false prophets (14:14-16).<br>
 <a name="fn833" href="jer.htm#fnB833"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (14:1)  <i>Drought</i> was one of the punishments for failure to adhere to the terms of their agreement with God. See Deut 28:22-24; Lev 26:18-20.<br>
 <a name="fn834" href="jer.htm#fnB834"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:1)  <i>Heb</i> "That which came [as] the word of the LORD to Jeremiah." The introductory formula here is a variation of that found in 7:1; 10:1; 11:1, i.e., "The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah." The relative "which" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rv#a&amp;</FONT>) actually precedes the noun it modifies. See BDB 82 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rv#a&amp;</FONT> 6.a for discussion and further examples.<br>
 <a name="fn835" href="jer.htm#fnB835"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:2)  <i>Heb</i> "Judah mourns, its gates pine away, they are in mourning on the ground." There are several figures of speech involved here. The basic figure is that of personification where Judah and it cities are said to be in mourning. However, in the third line the figure is a little hard to sustain because "they" are in mourning on the ground. That presses the imagination of most moderns a little too far. Hence the personification has been interpreted "people of" throughout. The term "gates" here is used as part for whole for the "cities" themselves as in several other passages in the OT (cf. BDB 1045 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ru^v^</FONT> 2.b, c and see, e.g., Isa 14:31).<br>
 <a name="fn836" href="jer.htm#fnB836"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:2)  The words "to me" are not in the text. They are implicit from the fact that the LORD is speaking. They are supplied in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn837" href="jer.htm#fnB837"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:3)  Though the concept of "cisterns" is probably not familiar to some readers, it would be a mistake to translate this word as "well." Wells have continual sources of water. Cisterns were pits dug in the ground and lined with plaster to hold rain water. The drought had exhausted all the water in the cisterns.<br>
 <a name="fn838" href="jer.htm#fnB838"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:3)  The word "containers" is a generic word in Hebrew = "vessels." It would probably in this case involve water "jars" or "jugs." But since in contemporary English one would normally associate those terms with smaller vessels, "containers" may be safer.<br>
 <a name="fn839" href="jer.htm#fnB839"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:3)  <i>Heb</i> "they cover their heads." Some of the translations have gone wrong here because of the "normal" use of the words translated here "disappointed" and "dismayed." They are regularly translated "ashamed" and "disgraced," "humiliated," "dismayed" elsewhere (see e.g., Jer 22:22); they are somewhat synonymous terms which are often parallel or combined. The key here, however, is the expression "they cover their heads" which is used in 2 Sam 15:30 for the expression of grief. Moreover, the word translated here "disappointed" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">voB</FONT>) is used that way several times. See for example Jer 12:13 and consult examples in BDB 101 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">voB</FONT> Qal 2. A very similar context with the same figure is found in Jer 2:36-37.<br>
 <a name="fn840" href="jer.htm#fnB840"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:4)  For the use of the verb "is cracked" here see BDB 369 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tt^j*</FONT> Qal 1 and compare the usage in Jer 51:56 where it refers to broken bows. The form is a relative clause without relative pronoun (cf., GKC &#167;155.<i>f</i>). The sentence as a whole is related to the preceding through a particle meaning "because of" or "on account of." Hence the subject and verb have been repeated to make the connection.<br>
 <a name="fn841" href="jer.htm#fnB841"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:5)  <i>Heb</i> "she gives birth and abandons."<br>
 <a name="fn842" href="jer.htm#fnB842"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:6)  <i>Heb</i> "their eyes are strained because there is no verdure."<br>
 <a name="fn843" href="jer.htm#fnB843"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:7)  The words "Then I said" are not in the text. However, it cannot be a continuation of the LORD's speech and the people have consistently refused to acknowledge their sin. The fact that the prayer here and in vv. 19-22 are followed by an address from God to Jeremiah regarding prayer (cf. 4:11 and the interchanges there between God and Jeremiah and 15:1) also argues that the speaker is Jeremiah. He is again identifying with his people (cf. 8:18-9:2). Here he takes up the petition part of the lament which often contains elements of confession of sin and statements of trust. In 14:1-6 God portrays to Jeremiah the people's lamentable plight instead of their describing it to him. Here Jeremiah prays what they should pray. The people are strangely silent throughout.<br>
 <a name="fn844" href="jer.htm#fnB844"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:7)  <i>Heb</i> "Act for the sake of your name." The usage of "act" in this absolute, unqualified sense cf.

 <a name="fn846" href="jer.htm#fnB846"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:7)  The Hebrew particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> can scarcely be causal here; it is either intensive (BDB 472 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> 1.e) or concessive (BDB 473 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> 2.c). The parallel usage in Gen 18:20 argues for the intensive force as does the fact that the concessive has already been expressed by <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;a!</FONT>.<br>
 <a name="fn847" href="jer.htm#fnB847"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:8)  It would be a mistake to translate this word as "stranger." This word (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rG}</FONT>) refers to a resident alien or resident foreigner who stays in a country not his own. He is accorded the privilege of protection through the common rights of hospitality but he does not have the rights of the native born or citizen. The simile here is particularly effective. The land was the LORD's land; they were but resident foreigners and tenants on it (Lev 25:23). Jeremiah's complaint here is particularly bold. For further information on the status of "resident foreigners" see <i>IDB</i> 4:397-99 s.v. "Sojourner."<br>
 <a name="fn848" href="jer.htm#fnB848"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:9)  This is the only time this word occurs in the Hebrew Bible. The lexicons generally take it to mean "confused" or "surprised" (cf. e.g., BDB 187 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;h^D&#180;</FONT>). However, the word has been found in a letter from the seventh century in a passage where it must mean something like "be helpless" (See W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 1:433 for discussion and bibliography of an article where this letter is dealt with.).<br>
 <a name="fn849" href="jer.htm#fnB849"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:9)  <i>Heb</i> "mighty man, warrior." For this nuance see 1 Sam 17:51 where it parallels a technical term used of Goliath used earlier in 17:4, 23.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (14:10)  The LORD answers indirectly, speaking neither to Jeremiah directly nor to the people. Instead of an oracle of deliverance which was hoped for (cf. 2 Chr 20:14-17; Pss 12:5 [12:6 HT]; 60:6-8 [60:8-10 HT]) there is an oracle of doom.<br>
 <a name="fn853" href="jer.htm#fnB853"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:10)  It is difficult to be certain how the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/K@</FONT> usually used for "thus, so" is to be rendered here. BDB 485 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/K@</FONT> 1.b says that the force sometimes has to be elicited from the general context and points back to the line of v. 9. <i>IHBS </i>&#167;39.3.4e, p. 666 states that when there is no specific comparative clause preceding a general comparison is intended. They point to Judg 5:31 as a parallel. Ps 127:2 may also be an example if, indeed, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> is not to be read (cf. <i>BHS</i> fn).

 <b>sn</b> (14:12)  These were penalties (curses) that were to be imposed on Israel for failure to keep her agreement with God (cf. Lev 26:23-26). These three occur together fourteen other times in the book of Jeremiah.<br>
 <a name="fn860" href="jer.htm#fnB860"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:13)  <i>Heb</i> "Lord Yahweh." The translation follows the ancient Jewish tradition of substituting the Hebrew word for God for the proper name Yahweh.<br>

 <a name="fn864" href="jer.htm#fnB864"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:13)  <i>Heb</i> "I will give you unfailing peace in this place." The translation opts for "peace and prosperity" here for the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;olv*</FONT> because in the context it refers both to peace from war and security from famine (and plague). The word translated "lasting" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tm#a$</FONT>) is a little hard to render here because it has broad uses of "truth," "reliability," "stability," "steadfastness," etc. "Guaranteed" or "lasting" seem to fit the context the best.<br>
 <a name="fn865" href="jer.htm#fnB865"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:14)  <i>Heb</i> "Falsehood those prophets are prophesying in my name." In the OT, the "name" reflected the person's character (cf. Gen 27:36; 1 Sam 25:25) or his reputation (Gen 11:4; 2 Sam 8:13). To speak in someone's name was to act as his representative or carry his authority (1 Sam 25:9; 1 Kgs 21:8).<br>
 <a name="fn866" href="jer.htm#fnB866"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:14)  <i>Heb</i> "I did not command them." Compare 1 Chr 22:12 for usage.<br>
 <a name="fn867" href="jer.htm#fnB867"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:14)  <i>Heb</i> "divination and worthlessness." The noun "worthlessness" stands as a qualifying "of" phrase (= to an adjective; an attributive genitive in Hebrew) after a noun in Zech 11:17; Job 13:4. It is here functioning in that construction where two nouns are joined by "and" with one serving as the qualifier of the other (the figure called hendiadys).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (14:14)  The word translated "predictions" here is really the word "divination." Divination was prohibited in Israel (cf. Deut 18:10, 14). The practice of divination involved various mechanical means to try to predict the future. The word was used here for its negative connotations in a statement that is rhetorically structured to emphasize the falseness of the promises of the false prophets. It would be unnatural to contemporary English style to try to capture this emphasis in English. In the Hebrew text the last sentence reads: "False vision, divination, and worthlessness and the deceitfulness of their heart they are prophesying to them." For the emphasis in the preceding sentence see the note there.<br>
 <a name="fn868" href="jer.htm#fnB868"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:15)  <i>Heb</i> "those prophets who are prophesying in my name."<br>
 <a name="fn869" href="jer.htm#fnB869"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:15)  <i>Heb</i> "Thus says the LORD about." The first person construction has been used in the translation for better English style.<br>
 <a name="fn870" href="jer.htm#fnB870"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:15)  <i>Heb</i> "Thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who are prophesying in my name and I did not send them [= whom I did not send] and they are saying [= who are saying], `Sword and famine...', by sword and famine those prophets will be killed." This sentence has been restructured to conform to contemporary English style.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (14:15)  The rhetoric of the passage is again sustained by an emphatic word order which contrasts what they say will not happen to the land, "war and famine," with the punishment that the LORD will inflict on them, i.e., "war and starvation [or, famine]."<br>
 <a name="fn871" href="jer.htm#fnB871"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:16)  <i>Heb</i> "And the people to whom they are prophesying will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem and there will not be anyone to bury them, they, their wives, and their sons and their daughters." This sentence has been restructured to break up a long Hebrew sentence and to avoid some awkwardness due to differences in the ancient Hebrew and contemporary English styles.<br>
 <a name="fn872" href="jer.htm#fnB872"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:16)  <i>Heb</i> "their evil." Hebrew words often include within them a polarity of cause and effect. Thus the word for "evil" includes both the concept of wickedness and the punishment for it. Other words that function this way are "iniquity" = "guilt [of iniquity]" = "punishment [for iniquity]." Context determines which nuance is proper.<br>
 <a name="fn873" href="jer.htm#fnB873"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:17)  The word "Jeremiah" is not in the text but the address is to a second person singular and is a continuation of 14:14 where the quote starts. The word is supplied in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn874" href="jer.htm#fnB874"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:17)  Many of the translations and commentaries render this an indirect or third person imperative, "Let my eyes overflow..." because of the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la^</FONT> which introduces the phrase translated "without ceasing" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hn&#180;ym#d+T!-la^</FONT>). However, this is undoubtedly an example where the particle introduces an affirmation that something cannot be done (cf. GKC &#167;109.<i>e</i>). Clear examples of this are found in Pss 41:2 (41:3 HT); 50:3; Job 40:32 (41:8). God here is describing again a lamentable situation and giving his response to it. See 14:1-6 above.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (14:17)  Once again it is the LORD lamenting the plight of the people, now directed to them, not the people lamenting their plight to him. See 14:1-6 and the study notes on the introduction to this section and on 14:7.<br>
 <a name="fn875" href="jer.htm#fnB875"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:17)  <i>Heb</i> "virgin daughter, my people." The last noun here is appositional to the first two (genitive of apposition). Hence it is not `literally' "virgin daughter of my people."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (14:17)  This is a metaphor which occurs several times with regard to Israel, Judah, Zion, and even Sidon and Babylon. It is the poetic personification of the people, the city, or the land. Like other metaphors the quality of the comparison being alluded to must be elicited from the context. This is easy in Isa 23:12 (oppressed) and Isa 47:1 (soft and delicate) but not so easy in other places. From the nature of the context the suspicion here is that the protection the virgin was normally privileged to is being referred to and there is a reminder that the people are forfeiting it by their actions. Hence God laments for them.<br>
 <a name="fn876" href="jer.htm#fnB876"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:17)  This is a poetic personification. To translate with the plural "serious wounds" might mislead some into thinking of literal wounds.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (14:17)  Compare Jer 10:19 for a similar use of this metaphor.<br>
 <a name="fn877" href="jer.htm#fnB877"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:18)  The word "starvation" has been translated "famine" elsewhere in this passage. It is the word which refers to hunger. The "starvation" here may be war induced and not simply that which comes from famine per se. "Starvation" will cover both.<br>
 <a name="fn878" href="jer.htm#fnB878"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:18)  The meaning of these last two lines is somewhat uncertain. The meaning of these two lines is debated because of the uncertainty of the meaning of the verb rendered "go about their business" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rj^s*</FONT>) and the last phrase translated here "without any real understanding." The verb in question most commonly occurs as a participle meaning "trader" or "merchant" (cf., e.g., Ezek 27:21, 36; Prov 31:14). It occurs as a finite verb elsewhere only in Gen 34:10, 21; 42:34 and there in a literal sense of "trading," "doing business." While the nuance is metaphorical here it need not extend to "journeying into" (cf., e.g., BDB 695 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rj^s*</FONT> Qal 1) and be seen as a reference to exile as is sometimes assumed. That seems at variance with the causal particle which introduces this clause, the tense of the verb, and the surrounding context. People are dying in the land (vv. 17-18a) not because prophet and priest have gone (the verb is the Hebrew perfect or past) into exile but because prophet and priest have no true knowledge of God or the situation. The clause translated here "without having any real understanding" (<i>Heb</i> "and they do not know") is using the verb in the absolute sense indicated in BDB 394 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ud~y&#180;</FONT> Qal 5 and illustrated in Isa 1:3; 56:10. For a more thorough discussion of the issues one may consult W. McKane, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 1:330-31.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (14:18)  For the "business" of the prophets and priest see 2:8; 5:13; 6:13; 8:10. In the context it refers to the prophets prophesying lies (see vv. 13-15).<br>
 <a name="fn879" href="jer.htm#fnB879"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:19)  The words, "Then I said, `LORD" are not in the Hebrew text. It is obvious from the context that the LORD is addressee. The question of the identity of the speaker is the same as that raised in vv. 7-9 and the arguments set forth there are applicable here as well. Jeremiah is here identifying with the people and doing what they refuse to do, i.e., confess their sins and express their trust in him.<br>
 <a name="fn880" href="jer.htm#fnB880"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:19)  <i>Heb</i> "does your soul despise." Here as in many places the word "soul" stands as part for whole for the person himself emphasizing emotional and volitional aspects of the person. However, in contemporary English one does not regularly speak of the "soul" in contexts such as this but of the person.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (14:19)  There is probably a subtle allusion to the curses called down on the nation for failure to keep their agreement with God. The word used here is somewhat rare (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu^G&#180;</FONT>). It is used of Israel's rejection of God's stipulations and of God's response to their rejection of him and his stipulations in Lev 26:11, 15, 30, 43-44. That the allusion is intended is probable when account is taken of the last line of v. 21.<br>
 <a name="fn881" href="jer.htm#fnB881"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:19)  <i>Heb</i> "Why have you struck us and there is no healing for us." The statement involves poetic exaggeration (hyperbole) for rhetorical effect.<br>
 <a name="fn882" href="jer.htm#fnB882"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:19)  <i>Heb</i> "[We hope] for a time of healing but behold terror."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (14:19)  The last two lines of this verse are repeated word for word from 8:15. There they are spoken by the people.<br>
 <a name="fn883" href="jer.htm#fnB883"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:20)  <i>Heb</i> "We acknowledge our wickedness [and] the iniquity of our [fore]fathers." For the use of the word "know" to mean "confess," "acknowledge" cf. BDB 394 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ud~y&#180;</FONT>, Qal 1.f and compare the usage in Jer 3:13.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (14:20)  For a longer example of an individual identifying with the nation and confessing their sins and the sins of their forefathers see Ps 106.<br>
 <a name="fn884" href="jer.htm#fnB884"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:20)  This is another example of the intensive use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT>. See BDB 472 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> 1.e.<br>
 <a name="fn885" href="jer.htm#fnB885"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:21)  Literally "For the sake of your name."<br>
 <a name="fn886" href="jer.htm#fnB886"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:21)  Translations quite commonly supply "us" as an object for the verb in the first line. This is probably wrong. The Hebrew text reads: "Do not treat with contempt for the sake of your name; do not treat with disdain your glorious throne." This is case of poetic parallelism where the object is left hanging until the second line. For an example of this see Prov 13:1 in the original and consult Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech, </i>pp. 103ff. There has also been some disagreement whether "your glorious throne" refers to the temple (as in 17:12) or Jerusalem (as in 3:17). From the beginning of the prayer in v. 19 where a similar kind of verb has been used with respect to Zion/Jerusalem it would appear that the contextual referent is Jerusalem. The absence of an object from the first line makes it possible to retain part of the metaphor in the translation and still convey some meaning.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (14:21)  The place of God's <i>glorious throne</i> was first of all the ark of the covenant where God was said to be enthroned between the cherubim, then the temple that housed it, then the city itself. See 2 Kgs 19:14-15 in the context of Sennacherib's attack on Jerusalem.<br>
 <a name="fn887" href="jer.htm#fnB887"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:21)  <i>Heb</i> "Remember, do not break your agreement [or, covenant] with us."<br>
 <a name="fn888" href="jer.htm#fnB888"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:22)  <i>Heb</i> "Is it not you, O LORD our God." The words "who does" are supplied in the translation for English style. The word "vanities" is a common pejorative epithet for idols or false gods. See already in 8:19 and 10:8.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (14:22)  The questions here are all rhetorical. The first two expect negative answers. They are balanced by one that expects a positive answer. It should be recalled that this whole section began with a lament over conditions brought on by a drought (see 14:1-6). It is also interesting to read this verse in the light of two earlier references to God as the giver of rain. In 5:24 the LORD laments that none of the people acknowledge him as the giver of rain. In 10:18 Jeremiah describes the LORD as the giver of rain in the midst of his contrasting the all powerful LORD with worthless idols. What the people will not do, Jeremiah does here for them.<br>
 <a name="fn889" href="jer.htm#fnB889"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:22)  <i>Heb</i> "Is it not you, O LORD our God?" The rhetorical negatives are balanced by a rhetorical positive.<br>
 <a name="fn890" href="jer.htm#fnB890"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:1)  The words "pleading for" have been supplied in the translation to explain the idiom (a metonymy). For parallel usage see BDB 763 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dm^u*</FONT> Qal 1.a and compare usage in Gen 19:27, Deut 4:10.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (15:1)  <i>Moses</i> and <i>Samuel</i> were well-known for their successful intercession on behalf of Israel. See Ps 99:6-8 and see, e.g., Exod 32:11-14, 30-34; 1 Sam 7:5-9. The LORD is here rejecting Jeremiah's intercession on behalf of the people (14:19-22).<br>
 <a name="fn891" href="jer.htm#fnB891"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:1)  <i>Heb</i> "my soul would not be toward them." For the usage of "soul" presupposed here see BDB 660 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp#n\</FONT> 6 in the light of the complaints and petitions in Jeremiah's prayer in 14:19, 21.<br>
 <a name="fn892" href="jer.htm#fnB892"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:1)  Literally "Send them away from my presence and let them go away."<br>
 <a name="fn893" href="jer.htm#fnB893"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:2)  It is difficult to render the rhetorical force of this passage in meaningful English. The text answers the question "Where should we go?" with four brief staccato-like expressions with a play on the preposition "to": <i>Heb</i> "Who to the death, to the death and who to the sword, to the sword and who to the starvation, to the starvation and who to the captivity, to the captivity." The word "death" here is commonly understood to be a poetic substitute for "plague" because of the standard trio of sword, famine, and plague (see, e.g., 14:12 and the notes there). This is likely here and in 18:21. For further support see W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 1:440. The nuance "starvation" rather than "famine" has been chosen in the translation because the referents here are all things that accompany war.<br>
 <a name="fn894" href="jer.htm#fnB894"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:3)  The translation attempts to render in understandable English some rather unusual uses of terms here. The verb translated "punish" is often used that way (cf. BDB 823 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dq^P*</FONT> Qal A.3 and compare usage in Jer 11:22, 13:21). However, here it is accompanied by a direct object and a preposition meaning "over" which is usually used in the sense of appointing someone over someone (cf. BDB 823 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dq^P*</FONT> Qal B.1 and compare usage in Jer 51:27). Moreover the word translated "different ways" normally refers to "families," "clans," or "guilds" (cf. BDB 1046-47 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hj*P*v=m!</FONT> for usage). Hence the four things mentioned are referred to figuratively as officers or agents into whose power the LORD consigns them. The Hebrew text reads: "I will appoint over them four guilds, the sword to kill, the dogs to drag away, the birds of the skies and the beasts of the earth to devour and to destroy."<br>
 <a name="fn895" href="jer.htm#fnB895"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:4)  The length of this sentence runs contrary to the normal policy followed in the translation of breaking up long sentences. However, there does not seem any way to break it up here without losing the connections.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (15:4)  For similar statements see 2 Kgs 23:26; 24:3-4 and for a description of what Manasseh did see 2 Kgs 21:1-16. Manasseh was the leader, but they willingly followed (cf. 2 Kgs 21:9).<br>
 <a name="fn896" href="jer.htm#fnB896"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:5)  The words "The LORD cried out" are not in the text. However, they are necessary to show the shift in address between speaking to Jeremiah in vv. 1-4 about the people and addressing Jerusalem in vv. 5-6 and the shift back to the address to Jeremiah in vv. 7-9. The words "oracle of the LORD" are, moreover, found at the beginning of v. 6.<br>
 <a name="fn897" href="jer.htm#fnB897"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:5)  The words, "in the world" are not in the text but are the translator's way of trying to indicate that this rhetorical question expects a negative answer.<br>
 <a name="fn898" href="jer.htm#fnB898"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:5)  <i>Heb</i> "turn aside."<br>
 <a name="fn899" href="jer.htm#fnB899"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:5)  Or "about your well being"; <i>Heb</i> "about your welfare" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;olv*</FONT>, <i>shalom</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn900" href="jer.htm#fnB900"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:6)  <i>Heb</i> "oracle of the LORD." In the original text this phrase is found between "you have deserted me" and "you keep turning your back on me." It is put at the beginning and converted to first person for sake of English style and clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn901" href="jer.htm#fnB901"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:6)  <i>Heb</i> "you are going backward." This is the only occurrence of this adverb with this verb. It is often used with another verb meaning "turn backward" (= abandon; <i>Heb</i> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gWs</FONT> in the Niphal). For examples see Jer 38:22; 46:5. The only other occurrence in Jeremiah has been in the unusual idiom in 7:24 where it was translated "they got worse and worse instead of better." That is how J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 109 translates it here. However it is translated, it has connotations of apostasy.<br>
 <a name="fn902" href="jer.htm#fnB902"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:6)  <i>Heb</i> "stretched out my hand against you." For this idiom see notes on 6:12.<br>
 <a name="fn903" href="jer.htm#fnB903"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:6)  There is a difference of opinion on how the verbs here and in the following verses are to be rendered, whether past or future. KJV, NASB, NIV for example render them as future. ASV, RSV, TEV render them as past. NJPS has past here and future in vv. 7-9. This is perhaps the best solution. The imperfect + <i>vav</i> consecutive here responds to the perfect in the first line. The imperfects + <i>vav</i> consecutives followed by perfects in vv. 7-9 and concluded by an imperfect in v. 9 pick up the perfects + <i>vav</i> consecutives in vv. 3-4. Verses vv. 7-9 are further development of the theme in vv. 1-4. Verses 5-6 have been an apostrophe or a turning aside to address Jerusalem directly. For a somewhat similar alternation of the tenses see Isa 5:14-17 and consult GKC &#167;111.<i>w</i>. One could of course argue that the imperfects + <i>vav</i> consecutive in vv. 7-9 continue the imperfect + <i>vav</i> consecutive here. In this case, vv. 7-9 are not a continuation of the oracle of doom but another lament by God (cf. 14:1-6, 17-18).<br>
 <a name="fn904" href="jer.htm#fnB904"><sup>15</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:6)  It is difficult to be sure what intertextual connections are intended by the author in his use of vocabulary. The Hebrew word translated "grown tired" is not very common. It has been used twice before. In 9:5-6b where it refers to the people being unable to repent and in 6:11 where it refers to Jeremiah being tired or unable to hold back his anger because of that inability. Now God too has worn out his patience with them (cf. Isa 7:13).<br>
 <a name="fn905" href="jer.htm#fnB905"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:7)  The words "The LORD continued" are not in the text. They have been supplied in the translation to show the shift back to talking about the people instead of addressing them.

 <a name="fn906" href="jer.htm#fnB906"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:7)  <i>Heb</i> "I have winnowed them with a winnowing fork in the gates of the land." The word "gates" is here being used figuratively for the cities, the part for the whole. See 14:2 and the notes there.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (15:7)  <i>Like straw blown away by the wind</i>. A figurative use of the process of winnowing is referred to here. Winnowing was the process whereby a mixture of grain and straw was thrown up into the wind to separate the grain from the straw and the husks. The best description of the major steps in threshing and winnowing grain in the Bible is seen in another figurative passage in Isa 41:15-16.<br>
 <a name="fn907" href="jer.htm#fnB907"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:7)  Or "did not repent of their wicked ways"; <i>Heb</i> "They did not turn back from their ways." There is no casual particle here either <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> which is more formally casual or <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">w+</FONT> which sometimes introduces casual circumstantial clauses. The causal idea is furnished by the connection of ideas. If the verbs throughout this section are treated as pasts and this section seen as a lament, then the clause could be sequential, "but they still did not turn..."<br>
 <a name="fn908" href="jer.htm#fnB908"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:8)  <i>Heb</i> "to me." BDB 513 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l</FONT> 5.a(d) compares the usage of the preposition "to" here to that in Jonah 3:3, "Nineveh was a very great city to God [in God's estimation]." The NEB/REB interpret as though it were the agent after a passive verb, "I have made widows more numerous." Most translations ignore it. The translation follows BDB though the emphasis on God's agency has been strong in the passage.<br>
 <a name="fn909" href="jer.htm#fnB909"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:8)  The translation of this line is a little uncertain because of the double prepositional phrase which is not represented in this translation or most of the others. The Hebrew text reads: "I will bring in to them, against mother of young men, a destroyer at noon time." Many commentaries delete the phrase with the Greek text. If the preposition read "against" like the following one this would be a case of apposition of nearer definition. There is some evidence of that in the Targum and the Syriac according to <i>BHS</i>. Both nouns "mothers" and "young men" are translated as plural here though they are singular; they are treated by most as collectives. It would be tempting to translate these two lines "In broad daylight I have brought destroyers against the mothers of her fallen young men." But this may be too interpretive. In the light of 6:4, noontime was a good time to attack. NJPS has "I will bring against them--young men and mothers together--...." In this case "mother" and "young men" would be a case of asyndetic coordination.<br>
 <a name="fn910" href="jer.htm#fnB910"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:8)  This word is used only here and in Hos 11:9. It is related to the root meaning "to rouse" (so BDB 735 s.v.

 <a name="fn913" href="jer.htm#fnB913"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:9)  The meaning of this line is debated.

However, as several commentaries have noted (e.g., W. McKane, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 1:341, J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 109) it makes little sense to talk about her suffering shame and embarrassment if she has breathed her last. Both the Greek and Latin versions understand "soul" not as the object but as the subject and the idea being one of fainting under despair. This idea seems likely in light of the parallelism. Bright suggests the phrase means either "she gasped out her breath" or "her throat gasped." The former is more likely. One might also render "she fainted dead away," but that idiom might not be familiar to all readers.<br>
 <a name="fn914" href="jer.htm#fnB914"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:9)  <i>Heb</i> "Her sun went down while it was still day."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (15:9)  The sun was the source of light and hence has associations with life, prosperity, health, and blessing. The premature setting of the sun which brought these seems apropos as metaphor for the loss of her children which were not only a source of joy, help, and honor. Two references where "sun" is used figuratively, Ps 84:11 (84:12 HT) and Mal 4:2, may be helpful here.<br>
 <a name="fn915" href="jer.htm#fnB915"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:9)  She has lost her position of honor and the source of her pride. For the concepts here see 1 Sam 2:5. <br>
 <a name="fn916" href="jer.htm#fnB916"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:9)  <i>Heb</i> "I will deliver those of them that survive to the sword before their enemies." The referent of "them" is ambiguous. Does it refer to the children of the widow (nearer context) or the people themselves (more remote context, v. 7)? Perhaps it was meant to include both. Verse seven spoke of the destruction of the people and the killing off of the children.<br>
 <a name="fn917" href="jer.htm#fnB917"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:10)  The words "I said" are not in the text. They are supplied in the translation for clarity to mark a shift in the speaker.<br>

 <a name="fn919" href="jer.htm#fnB919"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:10)  <i>Heb</i> "A man of strife and a man of contention with all the land." The "of" relationship (Hebrew and Greek genitive) can convey either subjective or objective relationships, i.e., he instigates strife and contention or he is the object of it. A study of usage elsewhere, e.g., Isa 41:11; Job 31:35; Prov 12:19; 25:24; 26:21; 27:15, is convincing that it is subjective. In his role as God's covenant messenger charging people with wrong doing he has instigated counterarguments and stirred about strife and contention against him.<br>
 <a name="fn920" href="jer.htm#fnB920"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tc</b> (15:10)  The translation follows the almost universally agreed upon correction of the Masoretic text. Instead of reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn]wl^l=q^m= hO&#247;K%</FONT> ("all of him is cursing me") as the Masoretes proposed (Qere) one should read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ynWll=q!</FONT> with the written text (Kethib) and redivide and repoint with the suggestion in <i>BHS</i> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;h#L=K%</FONT> ("all of them are cursing me").<br>
 <a name="fn921" href="jer.htm#fnB921"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:11)  The word "Jerusalem" is not in the text. It is supplied in the translation for clarity to identify the referent of "you." A comparison of three or four translations will show how difficult this verse is to interpret. The primary difficulty is with the meaning of the verb rendered here "I will surely send you out [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;t!wr]v@</FONT>]." The text and the meaning of the word are debated (for a rather full discussion see W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 1:446-47 fn b-b). Tied up with that is the meaning of the verb in the second line and the identification of who the speaker and addressee are. One of two tacks are usually followed. Some follow the Greek version which has Jeremiah speaking and supporting his complaint that he has been faithful. In this case the word "said" is left out, the difficult verb is taken to mean "I have served you" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;yT!r~v@</FONT>, from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tr~v*</FONT> [BDB 1058]) and the parallel verb means "I have made intercession for my enemies." The second tack is to suppose that God is speaking and is promising Jeremiah deliverance from his detractors. In this case the troublesome word is taken to mean "deliver" (cf. BDB 1056 s.v. I <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hr&#180;v*</FONT>), "strengthen" (see BDB's discussion) or read as a noun "remnant" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;t=yr]v@ </FONT>= <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;t=yr]v@</FONT>; again see BDB's discussion). In this case the parallel verb is taken to mean "I will cause your enemies to entreat you," a meaning it has nowhere else. Both of these tacks are probably wrong. The Greek text is the only evidence for leaving out "said." The problem with making Jeremiah the addressee is twofold. First, the word "enemy" is never used in the book of Jeremiah's foes, always of political enemies. Second, and more troublesome, one must assume a shift in the addressee between v. 11 and vv.13-14 or assume that the whole is addressed. The latter would be odd if he is promised deliverance from his detractors only to be delivered to captivity. If, however, one assumes that the whole is addressed to Jerusalem, there is no such problem. A check of earlier chapters will show that the second masculine pronoun is used for Judah/Jerusalem in 2:28-29; 4:1-2; 5:17-18; 11:13. In 2:28-28 and 4:1-2 the same shift from second singular to second plural takes place as does here in vv. 13-14. Moreover, vv. 13-14 continue much of the same vocabulary and is addressed to Jerusalem. The approach followed here is similar to that taken in REB except "for good" is taken in the way it is always used rather to mean "utterly." The nuance suggested by BDB 1056 s.v. I <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hr&#180;v*</FONT> is assumed and the meaning of the parallel verb is assumed to be similar to that in Isa 53:6 (see BDB 803 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ug~P*</FONT> Hiph 1). The Masoretic text is retained and demonstrable meanings. For the concept of "for good" see Jer 24:5-6. This assumes that the ultimate goal of God's discipline is here announced.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (15:11)  The LORD interrupts Jeremiah's complaint with a further word for Jerusalem. Compare a similar interruption in his discussion with Jeremiah in vv. 5-6.<br>
 <a name="fn922" href="jer.htm#fnB922"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:11)  "Surely" represents a construct in Hebrew that indicates a strong oath of affirmation. Cf. BDB 50 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;a!</FONT> 1.b(2) and compare usage in 2 Kgs 9:26.<br>
 <a name="fn923" href="jer.htm#fnB923"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:12)  Or "Can iron and bronze break iron from the north?" The question is rhetorical and expects a negative answer. The translation and meaning of this verse are debated. See note for further details. The two main difficulties here involve the relation of words to one another and the obscure allusion to iron from the north. To translate "literally" is difficult since one does not know whether "iron" is subject of "break" or object of an impersonal verb. Likewise, the dangling "and bronze" fits poorly with either understanding. Options: "Can iron break iron from the north and bronze?" Or "Can one break iron, even iron from the north and bronze." This last is commonly opted for by translators and interpreters, but why add "and bronze" at the end? And what does "iron from the north" refer to? A long history of interpretation relates it to the foe from the north (see already 1:14; 4:6; 6:1; 13:20). The translation follows the lead of NRSV and takes "and bronze" as a compound subject. I have no ready parallels for this syntax but the reference to "from the north" and the comparison to the stubbornness of the unrepentant people to bronze and iron in 6:28 suggests a possible figurative allusion. There is no evidence in the Bible that Israel knew about a special kind of steel like iron from the Black Sea mentioned in later Greek sources. The word "fist" is supplied in the translation to try to give some hint that it refers to a hostile force.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (15:12)  Compare Isa 10:5-6 for the idea here.<br>

See the threefold call to repentance in 3:12, 14, 22. The verb is used here four times "repent," "restore," and "become" twice.

This follows the Masoretic punctuation but violates usage. The verb "fill" never takes an object preceded by the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B=</FONT> (<i>bet</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn961" href="jer.htm#fnB961"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:19)  The words "Then I said" are not in the text. They are supplied in the translation to show the shift from God, who has been speaking to Jeremiah, to Jeremiah, who here addresses God.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (16:19)  The shift here is consistent with the interruptions that have taken place in chapters 14 and 15 and in Jeremiah's response to God's condemnation of the people of Judah's idolatry in chapter 10 (note especially vv. 6-16).<br>
 <a name="fn962" href="jer.htm#fnB962"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:19)  <i>Heb</i> "O LORD, my strength and my fortress, my refuge in the day of trouble. The literal which piles up attributes is of course more forceful than the predications. However, piling up poetic metaphors like this adds to the length of the English sentence and risks lack of understanding on the part of some readers. Some rhetorical force has been sacrificed for the sake of clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn963" href="jer.htm#fnB963"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:19)  Once again the translation has sacrificed some of the rhetorical force for the sake of clarity and English style: <i>Heb</i> "Only falsehood did our ancestors possess, vanity and [things in which?] there was no one profiting in them."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (16:19)  This passage offers some rather forceful contrasts. The LORD is Jeremiah's source of strength, security, and protection. The idols are false gods, worthless idols, that can offer no help at all.<br>
 <a name="fn964" href="jer.htm#fnB964"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:20)  <i>Heb</i> "and they are `no gods.'" For the construction here compare 2:11 and a similar construction in 2 Kgs 19:18 and see BDB 519 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aO</FONT> 1.b(b).<br>
 <a name="fn965" href="jer.htm#fnB965"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:21)  The words "The LORD said" are not in the text. However, it is obvious that he is the speaker. These words are supplied in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn966" href="jer.htm#fnB966"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:21)  Or "So I will make known to those nations, I will make known to them at this time my power and my might. Then they will know that my name is the LORD."<br>
 <b>tn</b> (16:21)  There is a decided ambiguity in this text about the identity of the pronoun "them." Is it his wicked people he has been predicting judgment upon or the nations that have come to recognize the folly of idolatry? The nearer antecedent would argue for that. However, usage of "hand" (translated here "power") in 6:12; 15:6 and later 21:5 and especially the threatening motif of "at this time" (or, "now") in 10:18 suggest that the "So" goes back logically to vv. 16-18, following a grounds of judgment with the threatened consequence as it has in at least 16 out of 18 occurrences thus far. Moreover it makes decidedly more sense that the Jews will know that his name is the LORD as the result of the present ("at this time") display of his power in judgment than that the idolaters will at some later (cf. Isa 2:2-4 for possible parallel) time. There has been a decided emphasis that the people of Israel do not "know" him (cf. 2:8; 4:22; 9:3, 6). Now they will, but in a way they did not wish to. There is probably an allusion (and an ironic reversal) here to Exod 3:13-15; 34:5-7. They have presumed upon his graciousness and forgotten that his name not only involves being with them to help but being against them to punish sin. Even if the alternate translation is followed the reference is still to God's mighty power made known in judging the wicked Judeans. The words "power" and "might" are here again a case of two nouns joined by "and" in which one modifies the other (hendiadys).<br>
 <a name="fn967" href="jer.htm#fnB967"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:1)  The chapter division which was not a part of the original text but was added in the middle ages obscures the fact that there is no new speech here. The division may have resulted from the faulty identification of the "them" in the preceding verse. See the translator's note on that verse.<br>
 <a name="fn968" href="jer.htm#fnB968"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:1)  The word "stone hearted" is not in the text. It is implicit in the metaphor and is supplied in the translation for clarity. Cf. Ezek 11:19; 36:26; and Job 19:24 for the figure.<br>
 <a name="fn969" href="jer.htm#fnB969"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:1)  The word "diamond" is an accommodation to modern times. There is no evidence that diamond was known in ancient times. The stone (which some think was emery), however, was hard and became metaphorical for hardness. See Ezek 3:9 and Zech 7:12 and for further discussion see IDB, "Adamant,"1:45.<br>
 <a name="fn970" href="jer.htm#fnB970"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:1)  This verse has been restructured for the sake of the English poetry: <i>Heb</i> "The sin of Judah is engraved [or, written] with an iron pen, inscribed with a point of a diamond [or, adamant] upon the tablet of their hearts and on the horns of their altars."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (17:1)  There is biting sarcasm involved in the use of the figures here. The law was inscribed on the tablets of stone by the "finger" of God (Exod 31:18; 32:16). Later under the new covenant it would be written on their hearts (Jer 31:33). Blood was to be applied to the horns of the altar in offering the sin offering (cf., e.g., Lev 4:7, 18, 25, 20) and on the bronze altar to cleanse it from sin on the Day of Atonement (Lev 16:18). Here their sins are engraved (permanently written, cf. Job 19:24) on their hearts (i.e., control their thoughts and actions) and on their altars (permanently polluting them).<br>
 <a name="fn971" href="jer.htm#fnB971"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:2)  It is difficult to convey in good English style the connection between this verse and the preceding. The text does not have a finite verb but a temporal preposition with an infinitive: <i>Heb</i> "while their children remember their altars..." It is also difficult to translate the verb "literally." (i.e., what does "remember" their altars mean?). Hence it has been rendered "always think about." Another possibility would be "have their altars...on their minds."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (17:2)  There is possibly a sarcastic irony involved here as well. The Israelites were to remember the LORD and what he had done and were to commemorate certain days, e.g., the Passover and the Sabbath which recalled their deliverance. Instead they resorted to the pagan altars and kept them in mind.<br>
 <a name="fn972" href="jer.htm#fnB972"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tc</b> (17:2)  This reading follows many Hebrew MSS and ancient versions. Many other Hebrew MSS read "your" [masc. pl.].<br>
 <a name="fn973" href="jer.htm#fnB973"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tc</b> (17:3)  This reading follows some of the ancient versions. The MT reads, "hills. My mountain in the open field [alluding to Jerusalem] and your wealth...I will give." The vocalization of the noun plus pronoun and the unusual form of the expression to allude to Jerusalem calls into question the originality of the Masoretic text. The MT reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yr]r&#180;h&amp; </FONT>which combines the suffix for a singular noun with a pointing of the noun in the plural, a form which would be without parallel (compare the forms in Ps 30:8 for the singular noun with suffix and Deut 8:9 for the plural noun with suffix). Likewise, Jerusalem was not "in the open field." For a similar expression compare Jer 13:27.<br>
 <a name="fn974" href="jer.htm#fnB974"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tc</b> (17:3)  Or "I will give away your wealth, all your treasures, and your places of worship..." The translation follows the emendation suggested in the footnote in <i>BHS</i>, reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ryj!m=B! </FONT>in place of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;yt#m)B*</FONT>. The forms are graphically very close and one could explain the origin of either from the other. The parallel in 15:13-14 reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ryj!m=B! aO</FONT>. The text here may be a deliberate play on that one. The emended text makes decidedly better sense contextually than the Masoretic text unless some sardonic reference to their idolatry is intended.<br>
 <a name="fn975" href="jer.htm#fnB975"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tc</b> (17:4)  Or "Through your own fault you will lose the land..." As McKane, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 1:386 notes the ancient versions do not appear to be reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;b=W</FONT> as in the Masoretic text but possibly <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;D+b^l=</FONT> (see <i>BHS</i> fn). The translation follows the suggestion in <i>BHS</i> fn that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;d+y&#180;</FONT> (literally "your hand") be read for MT <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;b=W</FONT>. This has the advantage of fitting the idiom of this verb with "hand" in Deut 15:2 (see also v. 3 there). The Hebrew text thus reads: "You will release your hand from your heritage."<br>
 <a name="fn976" href="jer.htm#fnB976"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tc</b> (17:4)  A few Hebrew MSS and two Greek MSS read "a fire is kindled in my anger" (reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hj*d+q*</FONT>) as in 15:14 in place of "you have kindled a fire in my anger" (reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;T#j=d~q*</FONT>) in the majority of Hebrew MSS and versions. The variant may be explained on the basis of harmonization with the parallel passage.<b> </b><br>
 <b>tn</b> (17:4)  <i>Heb</i> "you have started a fire in my anger which will burn forever."<br>
 <a name="fn977" href="jer.htm#fnB977"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (17:4)  Verses 5-11 are a collection of wisdom-like sayings (cf. Ps 1) which set forth the theme of the two ways and their consequences. It has as its background the blessings and the curses of Deut 28 and the challenge to faith in Deut 29-30 which climaxes in Deut 30:15-20. The nation is sinful and God is weary of showing them patience. However, there is hope for individuals within the nation if they will trust in him.<br>
 <a name="fn978" href="jer.htm#fnB978"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:5)  <i>Heb</i> "who make flesh their arm." The "arm" is the symbol of strength and the flesh is the symbol of mortal man in relation to the omnipotent God. The translation "mere flesh and blood" reflects this.<br>
 <a name="fn979" href="jer.htm#fnB979"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (17:5)  In the psychology of ancient Hebrew thought the <i>heart</i> was the center not only of the emotions but of the thoughts and motivations. It was also the seat of moral conduct (cf. its placement in the middle of the discussion of moral conduct in Prov 4:20-27, i.e., in v. 23).<br>
 <a name="fn980" href="jer.htm#fnB980"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:6)  This word occurs only here and in Jer 48:6. It has been identified as a kind of juniper, which is a short shrub with minute leaves that look like scales. For a picture and more discussion see UBS, <i>Fauna and Flora of the Bible,</i> p. 131.<br>
 <a name="fn981" href="jer.htm#fnB981"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:7)  <i>Heb</i> "Blessed is the person who trusts in the LORD, and whose confidence is in the LORD." However, because this is a statement of the LORD and the translation chooses to show that the blessing comes from him, the first person is substituted for the divine name.<br>
 <a name="fn982" href="jer.htm#fnB982"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:9)  Or "incurably deceitful"; <i>Heb</i> "It is incurable." For the word "deceitful" compare the usage of the verb in Gen 27:36 and a related noun in 2 Kgs 10:19. For the adjective "incurable" compare the usage in Jer 15:18. It is most commonly used with reference to wounds or of pain. In Jer 17:16 it is used metaphorically for a "woeful day" (i.e., day of irreparable devastation).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (17:9)  The background for this verse is Deut 29:18-19 (29:17-18 HT) and Deut 30:17.<br>
 <a name="fn983" href="jer.htm#fnB983"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:10)  The term rendered "mind" here and in the previous verse is actually the Hebrew word for "heart." However, in combination with the word rendered "heart" in the next line, which is the Hebrew for "kidneys," it is best rendered "mind" because the "heart" was considered the center of intellect, conscience, and will and the "kidneys" the center of emotions.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (17:10)  For an earlier reference to this motif see Jer 11:20. For a later reference see Jer 20:12. See also Ps 17:2-3.<br>
 <a name="fn984" href="jer.htm#fnB984"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:11)  The meaning of this line is somewhat uncertain. The word translated "broods over" occurs only here and Isa 34:15. It is often defined on the basis of an Aramaic cognate which means "to gather" with an extended meaning of "to gather together under her to hatch." Many commentators go back to a Rabbinic explanation that the partridge steals the eggs of other birds and hatches them out only to see the birds depart when they recognize that she is not the mother. Modern studies question the validity of this zoologically. Moreover, Holladay contests the validity on the basis of the wording "and she does hatch them" (<i>Heb </i>"bring them to birth"). See W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 1:498 and see also Craigie, Kelly, Drinkard, <i>Jeremiah 1-25</i>,<i> </i>p. 229. The point of the comparison is that the rich gather their wealth but they do not get to see the fruits of it.<br>
 <a name="fn985" href="jer.htm#fnB985"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:11)  The Hebrew text merely says "it." But the antecedent might be ambiguous in English so the reference to wealth gained by unjust means is here reiterated for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn986" href="jer.htm#fnB986"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:11)  <i>Heb</i> "he will be [= prove to be] a fool."<br>
 <a name="fn987" href="jer.htm#fnB987"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:12)  The words, "Then I said" are not in the text. They are supplied in the translation for clarity to show the shift in speaker.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (17:12)  The LORD is no longer threatening judgment but is being addressed. For a similar doxological interruption compare Jer 16:19-20.<br>
 <a name="fn988" href="jer.htm#fnB988"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:13)  <i>Heb</i> "O glorious throne, O high place from the beginning, O hope of Israel, O LORD." Commentators and translators generally understand these four lines (which are three in the Hebrew original) as two predications, one eulogizing the temple and the other eulogizing God. However, that does not fit the context very well and does not take into account the nature of Jeremiah's doxology in Jeremiah 16:19-20 (and compare also 10:6-7). There the doxology is context motivated, focused on God, and calls on relevant attributes in the form of metaphorical epithets. That fits nicely here as well. For the relevant parallel passages see the study note.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (17:13)  As King and Judge seated on his heavenly throne on high the LORD metes out justice. For examples of this motif see Jer 25:30; Psa 11:4; 9:4, 7 (9:5, 8 HT). As the place of sanctuary he offers refuge for those who are fleeing for safety. Ezek 11:16 and Isa 18:1-4 are examples of passages using that motif. Finally, the LORD has been referred to earlier as the object of Israel's hope (Jer 14:8). All of these are relevant to the choices that the LORD has placed before them, trust or turn away, and the threat that as all-knowing Judge he will reward people according to their behavior.<br>
 <a name="fn989" href="jer.htm#fnB989"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tc</b> (17:13)  The translation is based on an emendation suggested in W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 1:500, fn b-b. The emendation involves following the reading preferred by the Masoretes (the Qere) and understanding the preposition with the following word as a corruption of the suffix on it. Thus the present translation reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jr\a# ;yr\WsW</FONT> instead of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jr\a#B* yr~WsW</FONT> ("and those who leave me will be written in the earth"), a reading which is highly improbable since all the other pronouns are second singular.<br>
 <a name="fn990" href="jer.htm#fnB990"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:13)  Or "to the world of the dead." An alternative interpretation is: "will be as though their names were written in the dust"; <i>Heb</i> "will be written in the dust." The translation follows the nuance of "earth" listed in <i>HAL</i> 88 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jr\a#</FONT> 4 and found in Jonah 2:6 (2:7 HT); Job 10:21-22. For the nuance of "enrolling, registering among the number" for the verb translated here "consign" see BDB 507 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bt^K*</FONT> Qal 3 and 508 s.v. Niph 2 and compare usage in Ezek 13:9 and Ps 69:28 (69:29 HT). <br>
 <a name="fn991" href="jer.htm#fnB991"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:13)  <i>Heb</i> "The fountain of living water." For an earlier use of this metaphor and the explanation of it see Jer 2:13 and the notes there. There doesn't appear to be any way to retain this metaphor in the text without explaining it. In the earlier text the context would show that literal water was not involved. Here it might still be assumed that the LORD merely gives life-giving water.<br>
 <a name="fn992" href="jer.htm#fnB992"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:14)  The translation fills in the details of the metaphor from a preceding context (15:18) and from the following context (17:18). The literal translation "Heal me and I will be healed. Rescue me and I will be rescued." does not make much sense if these details are not filled in. The metaphor is filled in for clarity for the average reader.<br>
 <a name="fn993" href="jer.htm#fnB993"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:15)  <i>Heb</i> "Behold, they are saying to me."<br>
 <a name="fn994" href="jer.htm#fnB994"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:15)  <i>Heb</i> "Where is the word of the LORD. Let it come [or, come to pass] please."<br>
 <a name="fn995" href="jer.htm#fnB995"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tc</b> (17:16)  <i>Heb</i> "I have not run after you for the sake of disaster." The translation follows the suggestion of some ancient versions. The Hebrew text reads "I have not run from being a shepherd after you." The translation follows two Greek versions (Aquila and Symmachus) and the Syriac in reading the word "evil" or "disaster" here in place of the word "shepherd" in the Hebrew text. The issue is mainly one of vocalization. The versions mentioned are reading a form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hu*r&#180;m@</FONT> instead of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hu#r)m@</FONT>. There does not appear to be any clear case of a prophet being called a shepherd, especially in Jeremiah where it is invariably used of the wicked leaders/rulers of Judah, the leaders/rulers of the enemy that he brings to punish them, or the righteous ruler that he will bring in the future. Moreover, there are no cases where the preposition "after" is used with the verb "shepherd." Parallelism also argues for the appropriateness of this reading; "disaster" parallels the "incurable day." The thought also parallels the argument thus far. Other than 11:20; 12:3; 15:15 where he has prayed for vindication by the LORD punishing his persecutors as they deserve, he has invariably responded to the LORD's word of disaster with laments and prayers for his people (see 4:19-21; 6:24; 8:18; 10:19-25; 14:7-9, 19-22).<br>
 <a name="fn996" href="jer.htm#fnB996"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:16)  <i>Heb</i> "the incurable day." For the use of this word see the note on 17:9.<br>

Compare also the usage of the related verb which occurs in the next verse (see also BDB 369 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tt^j*</FONT> Qal 2).<br>
 <a name="fn999" href="jer.htm#fnB999"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:18)  Or "complete destruction." See the translator's note on 16:18.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (17:18)  Jeremiah now does what he says he has not wanted to do or been hasty to do. He is, however, seeking his own vindication and that of God whose threats they have belittled.<br>
 <a name="fn1000" href="jer.htm#fnB1000"><sup>34</sup></a><b>sn</b> (17:18)  Observance of the Sabbath Day (and the Sabbatical Year) appears to have been a litmus test of the nation's spirituality since it is mentioned in a number of passages besides this one (cf., e.g., Isa 56:2, 6; 58:13; Neh 13:15-18). Perhaps this is because the Sabbath Day was the sign of the Mosaic covenant (Exod 31:13-17) just as the rainbow was the sign of the Noahic covenant (Gen 9:12, 13, 17) and circumcision was the sign of the Abrahamic covenant (Gen 17:11). This was not the only command they failed to obey, nor was their failure to obey this one the sole determining factor in the LORD's decision to destroy Judah (cf. 7:23- 24; 11:7-8 in their contexts).<br>
 <a name="fn1001" href="jer.htm#fnB1001"><sup>35</sup></a><b>sn</b> (17:19)  The identity and location of the <i>People's Gate</i> is uncertain since it is mentioned nowhere else in the Hebrew Bible. Some identify it with the Benjamin Gate mentioned in Jer 37:13; 38:7, but there is no textual support for this in the Hebrew Bible or in any of the ancient versions.<br>
 <a name="fn1002" href="jer.htm#fnB1002"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:20)  The words "As you stand there" are not in the text but are implicit in the connection. They are supplied in the translation for clarity.<br>

This sentence has been restructured to avoid a long complex English sentence and to put "Listen to what the LORD says" closer to the content of what he says.<br>
 <a name="fn1004" href="jer.htm#fnB1004"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:21)  <i>Heb</i> "Be careful at the risk of your lives." The expression with the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B=</FONT> is unique. Elsewhere the verb "be careful" is used with the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l=</FONT> in the sense of the reflexive. Hence the word "soul" cannot be simply reflexive here. BDB 1037 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rm^v*</FONT> Niph 1 understands this as a case where the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B= </FONT>introduces the cost or price (cf.

 <a name="fn1005" href="jer.htm#fnB1005"><sup>39</sup></a><b>sn</b> (17:21)  Comparison with Neh 13:15-18 suggests that these loads were merchandise or agricultural produce which were being brought in for sale. The loads that were carried out of the houses in the next verse were probably goods for barter.<br>
 <a name="fn1006" href="jer.htm#fnB1006"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:21)  <i>Heb</i> "carry loads on the Sabbath and bring [them] in through." The translation treats the two verbs "carry" and "bring in" as another case of hendiadys (see the note on "Be careful...by carrying"). This is supported by the next line where only "carry out" of the houses is mentioned.<br>
 <a name="fn1007" href="jer.htm#fnB1007"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:22)  <i>Heb</i> "Do not carry any loads out of your houses on the Sabbath Day and do not do any work." Translating literally might give the wrong impression that they were not to work at all. The phrase "on the Sabbath Day" is, of course, intended to qualify both prohibitions.<br>
 <a name="fn1008" href="jer.htm#fnB1008"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:22)  <i>Heb</i> "But sanctify [or, set apart as sacred] the Sabbath Day." The idea of setting it apart as something sacred to the LORD is implicit in the command. See the explicit statements of this in Exod 20:10; 31:5; 35:2; Lev 24:8. For some readers the idea of treating the Sabbath Day as something sacred won't mean much without spelling the qualification out specifically. Sabbath observance was not just a matter of not working.<br>

The structure of prohibitions and commands followed by a brief "if" clause has been used to break up a long condition and consequence relationship which is contrary to contemporary English style.<br>

The structure of the original text is broken up here because of the long compound subject which would make the English sentence too long. The term "princes" is often omitted as a supposed double writing of the word that follows it and looks somewhat like it (the Hebrew reads here <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yb!v=y{ &lt;yr]c*w+</FONT>) or the same word which occurs later in the verse and is translated "officials" (the word can refer to either). It is argued that "princes" are never said to sit on the throne of David (translated here "follow in the succession of David"). However, the word is in all texts and versions and the concept of sitting on the throne of someone is descriptive of both past, present, and future and is even used with the participle in a proleptic sense of "the one who is to sit on the throne" (cf. Exod 11:15; 12:29).<br>

The Hebrew expression is very descriptive of the construction of a potter's wheel which consisted of two stones joined by a horizontal shaft. The potter rotated the wheel with his feet on the lower wheel and worked the clay with his hands on the upper. For a picture of a potter working at his wheel see <i>IDB</i> 3:846 s.v.

 <a name="fn1024" href="jer.htm#fnB1024"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:4)  The verbs here denote repeated action. They are the Hebrew perfect with the <i>vav</i> consecutive.

Muraoka, <i>A Grammar of Biblical Hebrew</i>, &#167;118n (pp. 393-94) , 167b (pp. 628-29) and compare the usage in Amos 4:7-8.<br>
 <a name="fn1025" href="jer.htm#fnB1025"><sup>7</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:4)  Something was wrong with the clay--either there was a lump in it, or it was too moist or not moist enough, or it had some other imperfection. In any case the vessel was "ruined" or "spoiled" or defective in the eyes of the potter. This same verb has been used of the linen shorts that were "ruined" and hence were "good for nothing" in Jer 13:7. The nature of the clay and how it responded to the potter's hand determined the kind of vessel that he made of it. He did not throw the clay away. This is the basis for the application in vv. 7-10 to any nation and to the nation of Israel in particular vv. 10-17.<br>
 <a name="fn1026" href="jer.htm#fnB1026"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:4)  The usage of the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B=</FONT> (<i>bet</i>) to introduce the material from which something is made in Exod 38:8; 1 Kgs 15:22 should lay to rest the rather forced construction that some like J. Bright, Jeremiah, p. 121 put on the variant <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rm#j)K^ </FONT>found in a few Hebrew MSS. Bright renders that phrase as an elliptical "as clay sometimes will." The phrase is missing from the Greek version.<br>

This is another example of the construction called hendiadys where one of the two verbs joined by "and" becomes the adverbial modifier of the other.

 <a name="fn1031" href="jer.htm#fnB1031"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:6)  The words "deals with the clay" are not in the text. They are part of an elliptical comparison and are supplied in the translation here for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn1032" href="jer.htm#fnB1032"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:7)  The word "Jeremiah" is not in the text but it is implicit from the introduction in v. 5 that he is being addressed. It is important to see how the rhetoric of this passage is structured. The words of vv. 7-10 lead up to the conclusion "So now" in v. 11 which in turns leads to the conclusion "Therefore" in v. 13. The tense of the verb in v. 12 is very important. It is a <i>vav</i> consecutive perfect indicating the future (cf. GKC &#167;112.<i>p</i>, <i>r</i>); their response is predictable. The words of vv. 7-10 are addressed to Jeremiah (v. 5) in fulfillment of the LORD's promise to speak to him (v. 2) and furnish the basis for the LORD's words of conditional threat to a people who show no promise of responding positively (vv. 11-12). Verse six then must be seen as another example of the figure of apostrophe (the turning aside from description about someone to addressing them directly; cf., e.g., Ps 6:8-9 (6:9-10 HT). Earlier examples of this figure have been seen in 6:20; 9:4; 11:13; 12:13; 15:6.<br>

The translation is structured this way to avoid an awkward English construction and to reflect the difference in disposition. The constructions are, however, the same.<br>
 <a name="fn1034" href="jer.htm#fnB1034"><sup>16</sup></a> <i>Heb</i> "turns from its wickedness."<br>
 <a name="fn1035" href="jer.htm#fnB1035"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:8)  There is a good deal of debate about how the word translated here "revoke" should be translated. There is a good deal of reluctance to translate it "change my mind" because some see that as contradicting Num 23:19 and thus prefer "relent." However, the English word "relent" suggests the softening of an attitude but not necessarily the change of course. It is clear that in many cases (including here) an actual change of course is in view (see, e.g., Amos 7:3, 6; Jonah 3:9; Jer 26:19; Exod 13:17; 32:14). Several of these passages deal with "conditional" prophecies where a change in behavior of the people or the mediation of a prophet involves the change in course of the threatened punishment (or the promised benefit). "Revoke" or "forgo" may be the best way to render this in contemporary English idiom.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (18:8)  There is a wordplay here involving the word "evil" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hu*r&#180;</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">r*u*h</FONT>) which refers to both the crime and the punishment. This same play is carried further in Jonah 3:10-4:1 where Jonah becomes very displeased (<i>Heb</i> "it was very evil to Jonah with great evil") when God forgoes bringing disaster (evil) on Nineveh because they have repented of their wickedness (evil).<br>
 <a name="fn1036" href="jer.htm#fnB1036"><sup>18</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:9)  <i>Heb</i> "plant." The terms "uproot," "tear down," "destroy," "build," and "plant" are the two sides of the ministry Jeremiah was called to (cf. Jer 1:10).<br>
 <a name="fn1037" href="jer.htm#fnB1037"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:11)  Literally "I am forming disaster and making plans against you." The word translated "forming" is the same as that for "potter," so there is a wordplay taking the reader back to v. 5. They are in his hands like the clay in the hands of the potter. Since they have not been pliable he forms new plans. He still offers them opportunity to repent; but their response is predictable.<br>

 <a name="fn1042" href="jer.htm#fnB1042"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:14)  The precise translation of this verse is somewhat uncertain. Two phrases in this verse are the primary cause of discussion and the source of numerous emendations, none of which has gained consensus. The phrase which is rendered here "rocky slopes" is in Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yd~c* rWx</FONT> which would normally mean something like "rocky crag of the field" (see BDB 961 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yd~c*</FONT> 1.g). Numerous emendations have been proposed, most of which are listed in the footnotes of J. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 436. The present translation has chosen to follow the proposal of several scholars that the word here is related to the Akkadian word <i>shadu</i> meaning mountain. The other difficulty is the word translated "cease" which in the Masoretic text is literally "be uprooted" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wvt=N&#180;y]</FONT>). The word is usually emended to read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wtv=N&#180;y]</FONT> "are dried up" as a case of transposed letters (cf., e.g., BDB 684 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vt^n&#180;</FONT> Niph). I suspect rather that this is a case of an error in hearing and the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vf^n&#180;</FONT> which is often parallel to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bz~u*</FONT>, translated here "vanish," should be read in the sense that it has in 1 Sam 10:2. Whether one reads "are plucked up" and understands it figuratively of ceasing, "are dried" or "cease," the sense is the same. For the sense of "distant" for the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yr]z&#180;</FONT> see 2 Kgs 19:24.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (18:14)  Israel's actions are contrary to nature. See the same kind of argumentation in Jer 2:11; 8:7.<br>
 <a name="fn1043" href="jer.htm#fnB1043"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:15)  <i>Heb</i> "the ancient path." This has already been referred to in Jer 6:16. There is another "old way" but it is the path trod by the wicked (cf. Job 22:15).<br>
 <a name="fn1044" href="jer.htm#fnB1044"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:15)  <i>Heb</i> "ways that are not built up." This refers to the built-up highways. See Isa 40:4 for the figure. The terms "way," "by-paths," "roads" are, of course, being used here in the sense of moral behavior or action.<br>
 <a name="fn1045" href="jer.htm#fnB1045"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:16)  There may be a deliberate double meaning involved here. The word translated here "an object of horror" refers both to destruction (cf. 2:15; 4:17) and the horror or dismay that accompanies it (cf. 5:30; 8:21). The fact that there is no conjunction or preposition in front of the noun "hissing" that follows this suggests that the reaction is in view here, not the cause.<br>
 <a name="fn1046" href="jer.htm#fnB1046"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:16)  <i>Heb</i> "an object of lasting hissing. All who pass that way will be appalled and shake their head."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (18:16)  The actions of "shaking of the head" and "hissing" were obviously gestures of scorn and derision. See Lam 2:15-16.<br>
 <a name="fn1047" href="jer.htm#fnB1047"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tc</b> (18:17)  <i>Heb</i> "I will show them [my] back and not [my] face." This reading follows the suggestion of some of the versions and some of the Masoretes. The Masoretic text reads "I will look on their back and not on their faces."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (18:17)  To "turn the back" is universally recognized as a symbol of rejection. The turning of the face toward one is the subject of the beautiful Aaronic blessing in Num 6:24-26.<br>
 <a name="fn1048" href="jer.htm#fnB1048"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:18)  <i>Heb</i> "They." The referent is unidentified; "some people" has been used in the translation.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (18:19)  Jeremiah's prayers against the unjust treatment of his enemies here and elsewhere (see 11:18-20; 12:1-4; 15:15-18; 17:14-18) have many of the elements of the prayers of the innocent in the book of Psalms: an invocation of the LORD as just judge, a lament about unjust attacks, an appeal to innocence, and a cry for vindication which often calls for the LORD to pay back in kind those who unjustly attack the petitioner. See for examples Pss 5, 7, 17, 54 among many others.<br>
 <a name="fn1054" href="jer.htm#fnB1054"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:20)  Or "They are plotting to kill me"; <i>Heb</i> "They have dug a pit for my soul." This is a common metaphor for plotting against someone. See BDB 500 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hr&#180;K*</FONT> Qal and for an example see Pss 7:16 (7:15 HT) in its context.<br>
 <a name="fn1055" href="jer.htm#fnB1055"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:20)  <i>Heb</i> "to speak good concerning them" going back to the concept of "good" being paid back with evil.<br>

 <a name="fn1057" href="jer.htm#fnB1057"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:21)  <i>Heb</i> "be poured out to the hand [= power] of the sword." For this same expression see Ezek 35:5; Ps 63:10 (63:11 HT). Comparison with those two passages show that it involved death by violent means, perhaps death in battle.<br>
 <a name="fn1058" href="jer.htm#fnB1058"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:21)  <i>Heb</i> "be slain by death." The commentaries are generally agreed that this refers to death by disease or plague as in 15:2. Hence, the reference is to the deadly trio of sword, starvation, and disease which were often connected with war. See the notes on 15:2.<br>
 <a name="fn1059" href="jer.htm#fnB1059"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:22)  <i>Heb</i> "when you bring marauders in against them." For the use of the noun translated here "bands of raiders to plunder them" see 1 Sam 30:3, 15, 23 and BDB 151 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dWdG+</FONT> 1.<br>

 <a name="fn1062" href="jer.htm#fnB1062"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:1)  The word "Jeremiah" is not in the text. Some Hebrew MSS and some of the versions have "to me." This section, 19:1-20:6 appears to be one of the biographical sections of the book of Jeremiah where incidents in his life are reported in third person. See clearly 9:14 and 20:1-3. The MSS and versions do not represent a more original text but are translational or interpretive attempts to fill in a text which had no referent. They are like the translational addition that has been supplied on the basis of contextual indicators.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (19:1)  The word translated "clay" here refers to a clay which has been baked or fired in a kiln. In Jer 18 the clay was still soft and pliable, capable of being formed into different kinds of vessels. Here the clay is set, just as Israel is set in its ways. The word for jar refers probably to a water jug or decanter and is onomatopoeic, <i>baqbuq</i>, referring to the gurgling sound made by pouring out the water.<br>
 <a name="fn1064" href="jer.htm#fnB1064"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tc</b> (19:1)  The words "Take with you" follow the reading of the Syriac version and to a certain extent the reading of the Greek version (the latter does not have "with you").

It is sometimes identified with the Dung Gate mentioned in Neh 2:13; 3:13-14; 12:31 on the basis of the Jerusalem Targum. It is probably called "Potsherd's Gate" because that is where the potter threw out the broken pieces of pottery which were no longer of use to him. The Valley of Ben Hinnom has already been mentioned in 7:31-32 in connection with the illicit religious practices, including child sacrifice, which took place there. The Valley of Ben Hinnom (or sometimes Valley of Hinnom) runs along the west and south sides of Jerusalem.<br>

 <a name="fn1069" href="jer.htm#fnB1069"><sup>8</sup></a><b>sn</b> (19:3)  Careful comparison of the use of this term throughout this passage and comparison with 7:31-33 which is parallel to several verses in this passage will show that the reference is to the Valley of Ben Hinnom which will become a Valley of Slaughter (see v. 6 and 7:32).<br>
 <a name="fn1070" href="jer.htm#fnB1070"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:3)  <i>Heb</i> "which everyone who hears it [or, about it] his ears will ring." This is proverbial for a tremendous disaster. See 1 Sam 3:11; 2 Kgs 21:12 for similar prophecies.<br>
 <a name="fn1071" href="jer.htm#fnB1071"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:4)  The text merely has "they." But since a reference is made later to "they" and "their ancestors," the referent must be to the people that the leaders of the people and leaders of the priests represent.<br>
 <a name="fn1072" href="jer.htm#fnB1072"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (19:4)  <i>Heb</i> "have made this city foreign." The verb here is one that is built off of the noun and adjective which relate to foreign nations. Comparison may be made to Jer 2:21 where the adjective refers to the strange, wild vine as opposed to the choice vine the LORD planted and to 5:19 and 8:19 where the noun is used of worshiping foreign gods. Israel through its false worship has "denationalized" itself in its relation to God.<br>

Some have seen a reference to the sins of social injustice alluded to in 2 Kgs 21:16 and 24:4 but those are connected with the city itself. Hence the word children is supplied in the translation to make the referent explicit.<br>
 <a name="fn1075" href="jer.htm#fnB1075"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:5)  The word "here" is not in the text. However, it is implicit from the rest of the context. It is supplied in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn1076" href="jer.htm#fnB1076"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:5)  The words "such sacrifices" are not in the text. The text merely says "to burn their children in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal which I did not command." The command obviously refers not to the qualification "to Baal" but to burning the children in the fire as burnt offerings. The words are supplied in the translation to avoid a possible confusion that the reference is to sacrifices to Baal. Likewise the words should not be translated so literally that they leave the impression that God never said anything about sacrificing their children to other gods. The fact is he did. See Lev 18:21; Deut 12:30; 18:10.<br>

 <a name="fn1079" href="jer.htm#fnB1079"><sup>18</sup></a><b>sn</b> (19:7)  There is perhaps a two-fold wordplay in the use of this word. One involves the sound play with the word for "jar," which has been explained as a water decanter. The word here is <i>baqqoti</i>. The word for jar in v. 1 is <i>baqbuq</i>. There may also be a play on the literal use of this word to refer to the laying waste or destruction of a land (see Isa 24:3; Nah 2:3). Many modern commentaries think that at this point Jeremiah emptied out the contents of the jar, symbolizing the "emptying" out of their plans.<br>
 <a name="fn1080" href="jer.htm#fnB1080"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (19:7)  This refers to the fact that they will die in battle. The sword would be only one of the weapons that strikes them down.

This word has been used several times for the metaphorical "wounds" that Israel has suffered as a result of the blows from its enemies. See, e.g., 14:17. It is used in the Hebrew Bible of scourging, both literally and metaphorically (cf. Deut 25:3; Isa 10:26), and of slaughter and defeat (1 Sam 4:10; Josh 10:20). Here it refers to the results of the crushing blows at the hands of her enemies which has made her the object of scorn.<br>
 <a name="fn1084" href="jer.htm#fnB1084"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:9)  This verse has been restructured to try to bring out the proper thought and subordinations reflected in the verse without making the sentence too long and complex in English: <i>Heb</i> "I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters. And they will eat one another's flesh in the siege and in the straits which their enemies who are seeking their lives reduce them to." This also shows the agency through which God's causation was effected, i.e., the siege.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (20:1)  Judging from a comparison of this passage with Jer 29:26-27 and that passage in turn with 2 Kgs 25:18, Pashur held an office second in rank only to the high priest. He was in charge of keeping order in the temple and took offense at what he heard Jeremiah saying.<br>

 <a name="fn1099" href="jer.htm#fnB1099"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:2)  The meaning of this word is uncertain. It occurs only here, in 29:26 where it is followed by a parallel word that occurs only there and is generally translated "collar," and in 2 Chr 16:10 where it is preceded by the word "house of." It is most often translated "stocks" and explained as an instrument of confinement for keeping prisoners in a crooked position (from its relation to a root meaning "to turn."

 <a name="fn1100" href="jer.htm#fnB1100"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:2)  A comparison of Ezek 8:3 and 9:2 in their contexts will show that this probably refers to the northern gate to the inner court of the temple. It is called Upper because it was on higher ground above the gate in the outer court. It is qualified by "in the LORD's temple" to distinguish it from the Benjamin Gate in the city wall (cf. 37:13; 38:7). Like the Benjamin Gate in the city wall it faced north toward the territory of the tribe of Benjamin.<br>
 <a name="fn1101" href="jer.htm#fnB1101"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:3)  This name is translated rather than transliterated to aid the reader in understanding this name and connect it clearly with the explanation that follows in the next verse. For a rather complete discussion on the significance of this name and an attempt to explain it as a pun on the name "Pashur" see J. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 455, fn 35.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (20:3)  The name <i>Pashur </i>is essentially a curse pronounced by Jeremiah invoking the LORD's authority. The same phrase occurs in Jer 6:25; 46:5; 49:29 which are all in the context of war. In ancient Israelite culture the change in name denoted a change in status or destiny. See, for example, the shift from Jacob ("He grabs the heel" and "Cheater" or "Deceiver," Gen 25:26; 27:36) to Israel ("He perseveres with God," Gen 32:28).<br>
 <a name="fn1102" href="jer.htm#fnB1102"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:4)  <i>Heb</i> "I will make you an object of terror to both you and your friends."<br>

 <a name="fn1106" href="jer.htm#fnB1106"><sup>10</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:6)  As a member of the priesthood and the protector of order in the temple, Pashur was undoubtedly one of those who promulgated the deceptive belief that the LORD's presence in the temple was a guarantee of Judah's safety (cf. 7:4, 8). Judging from the fact that two other men held the same office after the leading men in the city were carried into exile in 597 B.C. (see Jer 29:25-26 and compare 29:1-2 for the date and 2 Kgs 24:12-16 for the facts), this prophecy was probably fulfilled in 597. For a similar kind of oracle of judgment see Amos 7:10-17.<br>
 <a name="fn1107" href="jer.htm#fnB1107"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:7)  The translation is admittedly interpretive but so is every other translation that tries to capture the nuance of the verb rendered here "coerced." Here the Hebrew text reads: "You [--]ed me and I let myself be [--]ed. You overpowered me and prevailed." The value one assigns to [--] is in every case interpretive based on what one thinks the context is referring to. The word is rendered "deceived" or "tricked" by several translations (see, e.g., KJV, NASB, TEV, ICV) as though God had misled him. It is rendered "enticed" by some (see, e.g., NRSV, NJPS) as though God had tempted him with false hopes. Some go so far as to accuse Jeremiah of accusing God of metaphorically "raping" him (see, e.g., the fn in <i>Harper Collins Study Bible</i>, p. 1151). It is true that the word is used of "seducing" a virgin in Exod 22:15 and that it is used in several places to refer to "deceiving" someone with false words (Prov 24:28; Ps 78:36). It is also true that it is used of "coaxing" someone to reveal something he does not want to (Judg 14:15; 16:5) and of "enticing" someone to do something on the basis of false hopes (1 Kgs 22:20-22; Prov 1:10). However, it does not always have negative connotations or associations. In Hos 2:14 (2:16 HT) God "charms" or "woos" Israel, his estranged `wife,' into the wilderness where he hopes to win her back to himself. What Jeremiah is alluding to here is crucial for translating and interpreting the word. There is no indication in this passage that Jeremiah is accusing God of misleading him or raising false hopes; God informed him at the outset that he would encounter opposition (1:17-19). Rather, he is alluding to his call to be a prophet, a call which he initially resisted but was persuaded to undertake because of God's persistence (Jer 1:7-10). The best single word to translate `...' with is thus "persuaded" or "coerced." The translation spells out the allusion explicitly so the reader is not left wondering about what is being alluded to when Jeremiah speaks of being "coerced." The translation "I let you do it" is a way of rendering the Niphal of the same verb which must be tolerative rather than passive since the normal passive for the Piel would be the Pual (See <i>IBHS</i> &#167;23.4.f, g, pp. 389-90 for discussion and examples.). The translation "you overcame my resistance" is based on allusion to the same context (1:7-10) and the parallel use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qz~j*</FONT> as a transitive verb with a direct object in 1 Kgs 16:22.<br>
 <a name="fn1108" href="jer.htm#fnB1108"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:8)  <i>Heb</i> "speak," but the speaking is in the context of speaking as a prophet.<br>

 <a name="fn1110" href="jer.htm#fnB1110"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:8)  <i>Heb</i> "Violence and destruction."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (20:8)  The words "<i>Violence and destruction...</i>" are a synopsis of his messages of judgment. Jeremiah is lamenting that his ministry up to this point has been one of judgment and has brought him nothing but ridicule because the LORD has not carried out his threats. He appears in the eyes of the people to be a false prophet.<br>
 <a name="fn1111" href="jer.htm#fnB1111"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:8)  <i>Heb</i> "the word of the LORD." For the use of the two <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT>s here in the sense of "for...and" see KBL 432 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK</FONT> 10.<br>
 <a name="fn1112" href="jer.htm#fnB1112"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:9)  <i>Heb</i> "speak in his name." This idiom occurs in passages where someone functions as the messenger under the authority of another. See Exod 5:23; Deut 18:19, 29:20; Jer 14:14. The antecedent in the first line is quite commonly misidentified as being "him," i.e., the LORD. Comparison, however, with the rest of the context, especially the consequential clause "then it becomes" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hy&#180;h*w+</FONT>), and Jer 23:36 shows that it is "the word of the LORD."<br>
 <a name="fn1113" href="jer.htm#fnB1113"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:9)  The English sentence has again been restructured for the sake of English style. The Hebrew construction involves two <i>vav</i> consecutive perfects in a condition and consequence relation, "If I say to myself...then it [his word] becomes." See GKC &#167;112.<i>kk</i> for the construction.<br>
 <a name="fn1114" href="jer.htm#fnB1114"><sup>18</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:9)  <i>Heb</i> "It is in my heart like a burning fire, shut up in my bones." In addition to standing as part for the whole, the "bones" for the person (e.g., Ps 35:10), the bones were associated with fear (e.g., Job 4:14) and with pain (e.g., Job 33:19, Ps 102:3 [102:4 HT]) and joy or sorrow (e.g., Ps 51:8 [51:10 HT]). As has been mentioned several times, the heart was connected with intellectual and volitional concerns.<br>
 <a name="fn1115" href="jer.htm#fnB1115"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:10)  It would be difficult to render accurately the Hebrew particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> that introduces this verse without lengthening the English line unduly. It probably means something like "This is true even though I...," i.e., the particle is concessive (cf. BDB s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> 2.c). No other nuance seems appropriate. The particle is left out of the translation, but its presence is acknowledged here.<br>
 <a name="fn1116" href="jer.htm#fnB1116"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:10)  The phrase translated "Those who would cause me terror are everywhere" has already occurred in 6:25 in the context of the terror caused by the enemy from the north and in 20:3 in reference to the curse pronounced on Pashur who would experience it first hand. Some have seen the phrase here not as Jeremiah's ejaculation of terror but of his assailant's taunts of his message or even their taunting nickname for him. But comparison of this passage with the first two lines of Ps 31:13 (31:14 HT) which are word for word the same as these two will show that it refers to the terror inspired by the plots of his enemies to do away with him. It is also clear from the context of that passage and the following context here that the "whispering of many" (the literal translation of "many whispering words of intrigue against me) refers to intrigues to take vengeance on him and do away with him.<br>
 <a name="fn1117" href="jer.htm#fnB1117"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:10)  <i>Heb</i> "Denounce and let us denounce him." The verb which is translated "denounce" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dg~n&#180;</FONT>) does not take an accusative object of person as it does here very often. When it does it usually means to inform someone. The only relevant passage appears to be Job 17:5 where it means something like "denounce." What is probably involved here are the attempts to portray Jeremiah as a traitor (Jer 26:10) and a false prophet (see his conflict with Hananiah in Jer 28).<br>
 <a name="fn1118" href="jer.htm#fnB1118"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:10)  <i>Heb</i> "the men of my peace [who are concerned about my welfare]." For this phrase compare Ps 41:9 (41:10 HT); Jer 38:22. It is generally agreed that irony is being invoked here, hence "so-called" is supplied in the translation to bring out the irony.<br>
 <a name="fn1119" href="jer.htm#fnB1119"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:10)  <i>Heb</i> "watching my stumbling [for me to stumble]." Metaphorically they were watching for some slip-up that would lead to his downfall. Compare the use in Pss 35:15 and 38:17 (38:18 HT).<br>
 <a name="fn1120" href="jer.htm#fnB1120"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:10)  All the text says literally is "Perhaps he can be enticed so that we can prevail over him." However the word "enticed" needs some qualification. As W. McKane, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 1:479 notes it should probably be read in the context of the "stumbling" (= "something that would lead to my downfall"). Hence "slipping up" has been supplied as an object. It is vague enough to avoid specifics as the original text does but suggests some reference to "something that would lead to my downfall."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (20:10)  There is an interesting ironical play on words here with the earlier use of these same Hebrew words in v. 7 to refer to the LORD coercing him into being his spokesman and overcoming his resistance. Jeremiah is lamenting that it was God's call to speak his word which he could not (and still cannot) resist that has led ironically to his predicament, which is a source of terror to him.<br>
 <a name="fn1121" href="jer.htm#fnB1121"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:11)  This line has some interesting ties with Jer 15:20-21 where Jeremiah is assured by God that he is indeed with him as he promised him when he called him (1:8, 19) and will deliver him from the clutches of wicked and violent people. The word translated here "awe-inspiring" is the same as the word "violent people" there. Jeremiah is confident that his "awe-inspiring" warrior will overcome "violent people." The statement of confidence here is, by the way, a common element in the psalms of petition in the Psalter. The common elements of that type of psalm are all here: invocation (v. 7), lament (vv. 7-10), confession of trust/confidence in being heard (v. 11), petition (v. 12), thanksgiving or praise (v. 13). For some examples of this type of psalm see Pss 3, 7, 26.<br>
 <a name="fn1122" href="jer.htm#fnB1122"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:12)  <i>Heb</i> "Yahweh of armies."<br>

 <a name="fn1123" href="jer.htm#fnB1123"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:12)  <i>Heb</i> "LORD of armies, the one who tests the righteous, who sees kidneys and heart." The sentence has been broken up to avoid a long and complex English sentence. The translation is more in keeping with contemporary English style.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (20:12)  This verse is almost an exact duplication of the petition in one of Jeremiah's earlier prayers and complaints. See Jer 11:20 and notes there for explanation of the Hebrew psychology underlying the use of "kidneys and heart" here. For the thoughts expressed here see Ps 17.<br>
 <a name="fn1124" href="jer.htm#fnB1124"><sup>28</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:13)  While it may be a little confusing to modern readers to see the fluctuation in moods and the shifts in addressee in a prayer and complaint like this, it was not at all unusual for Israel where these were often offered in the temple in the conscious presence of God before fellow worshipers. For another example of these same shifts see Ps 22 which is a prayer of David in a time of deep distress.<br>
 <a name="fn1125" href="jer.htm#fnB1125"><sup>29</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:14)  From the heights of exaltation, Jeremiah returns to the depths of despair. For similar mood swings in the psalms of lament compare Ps 102. Verses 14-18 are similar in tone and mood to Job 3:1-10. They are very forceful rhetorical ways of Job and Jeremiah expressing the wish that they had never been born.<br>
 <a name="fn1126" href="jer.htm#fnB1126"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:15)  <i>Heb</i> "Cursed be the man who brought my father the news saying, `A son, a male, has been born to you,' making glad his joy." This verse has been restructured for English stylistic purposes.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (20:15)  The birth of a child was an occasion of great joy. This was especially true if the child was a boy because it meant the continuance of the family line and the right of retention of the family property. See Ruth 4:10, 13-17.<br>
 <a name="fn1127" href="jer.htm#fnB1127"><sup>31</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:16)  The <i>cities</i> alluded to are Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities of the Jordan plain which had become proverbial for their wickedness and for the destruction that the LORD brought on them because of it.

 <a name="fn1131" href="jer.htm#fnB1131"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:1)  <i>Zedekiah</i> was the last king of Judah. He ruled from 597 B.C. when he was placed on the throne by Nebuchadnezzar (2 Kgs 24:17) until the fall of Jerusalem in 587/6 B.C. He acquiesced to some of his anti-Babylonian counselors, rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar, and sought help from the Egyptians (Ezek 17:12-15). This brought Nebuchadnezzar against the city in 588 B.C. This is the first of two delegations to Jeremiah. The later one was sent after Nebuchadnezzar withdrew to take care of the Egyptian threat (cf. Jer 37:1-9). <br>

This Pashur is referred to later in 38:1. The <i>Zephaniah</i> referred to here was the chief of security referred to later in Jer 29:25-26. He appears to have been favorably disposed toward Jeremiah.<br>

 <a name="fn1134" href="jer.htm#fnB1134"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:2)  The verb used here is often used of seeking information through a prophet (e.g., 2 Kgs 1:16; 8:8) and hence many translate "inquire of the LORD for us." However, it is obvious from the following that they were not seeking information but help. The word is also used for that in Pss 34:4 (34:5 HT); 77:2 (77:3 HT).<br>
 <a name="fn1135" href="jer.htm#fnB1135"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:2)  The dominant spelling of this name is actually Nebuchadrezzar which is closer to his Babylonian name <i>Nebu kudduri uzzur</i>. An alternate spelling which is found 6 times in the book of Jeremiah and 17 times elsewhere is Nebuchadnezzar which is the form of the name that is usually used in English translations.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (21:2)  <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> was the second and greatest king of Babylon. He is known in the Bible both for his two conquests of Jerusalem in 597 B.C. (2 Kgs 24:10-17) and 587 B.C. (2 Kgs 25:1-7) and for his having built Babylon the Great (Dan 4:28-30).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (21:2)  The <i>miracles</i> that they may have had in mind would have included the Exodus, the conquest of Jericho, the deliverance of Jehoshaphat (2 Chr 20:1-30), etc., but predominant in their minds was probably the deliverance of Jerusalem from Sennacherib in the times of Hezekiah (Isa 37:33-38).<br>
 <a name="fn1137" href="jer.htm#fnB1137"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:4)  <i>Heb</i> "Tell Zedekiah, `Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel.'" Using the indirect quote eliminates one level of embedded quotation and makes it easier for the reader to follow.<br>

The Chaldeans were a group of people in the country south of Babylon from which Nebuchadnezzar came. The Chaldean dynasty his father established became the name by which the Babylonians are regularly referred to in the book of Jeremiah. Jeremiah's contemporary Ezekiel uses both terms.<br>
 <a name="fn1140" href="jer.htm#fnB1140"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:4)  The structure of the Hebrew sentence of this verse is long and complex and has led to a great deal of confusion and misunderstanding. There are two primary points of confusion: 1) the relation of the phrase "outside the walls," and 2) the antecedent of "them" in the last clause of the verse that reads in Hebrew: "I will gather them back into the midst of the city." Most take the phrase "outside the walls" with "the Babylonians...." Some take it with "turn back/bring back" to mean "from outside...." However, the preposition "from" is part of the idiom for "outside...." The phrase goes with "fighting" as J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 215 notes and as NJPS suggest. The antecedent of "them" has sometimes been taken mistakenly to refer to the Babylonians. It refers rather to "the forces at your disposal" which is literally "the weapons which are in your hands." This latter phrase is a figure involving substitution (called metonymy) as Bright also correctly notes. The whole sentence reads in Hebrew: "I am going to bring back the weapons of war which are in your hand with which you are fighting Nebuchadrezzar the King of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside your wall and I will gather them into the midst of the city." The sentence has been restructured to better reflect the proper relationships and to make the sentence conform more to contemporary English style.<br>
 <a name="fn1141" href="jer.htm#fnB1141"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:5)  <i>Heb</i> "with outstretched hand and with strong arm." These are, of course, figurative of God's power and might. He does not literally have hands and arms.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (21:5)  The phrases in this order are unique but a very similar phrase "by strong hand and outstretched arm" are found several times with reference to God's mighty power unleashed against Egypt at the exodus (cf., Deut 4:34; 5:15; 26:8; Jer 32:21; Ps 136:12). Instead of being directed at Israel's enemies it will now be directed against her. <br>

 <b>sn</b> (21:9)  Spoil was what was carried off by the victor (see, e.g., Judg 5:30). Those who surrendered to the Babylonians would lose their property, their freedom, and their citizenship but would at least escape with their lives. Jeremiah was branded a traitor for this counsel (cf. 38:4) but it was the way of wisdom since the LORD was firmly determined to destroy the city (cf. v. 10).<br>

For the use of the idiom "set one's face against/toward" see, e.g., usage in 1 Kgs 2:15; 2 Kgs 2:17; Jer 42:15, 17 and note the interesting interplay of usage in Jer 44:11-12.<br>

 <a name="fn1151" href="jer.htm#fnB1151"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:11)  The words "The LORD told me to say" are not in the text. They have been supplied in the translation for clarity. This text has been treated in two very different ways depending upon how one views the connection of the words "and to/concerning the household of the King of Judah, `Hear the word of the LORD:...'" with the preceding and following. Some treat the words that follow as a continuation of Jeremiah's response to the delegation sent by Zedekiah (cf. vv. 3, 8). Others treat this as introducing a new set of oracles parallel to those in 23:9-40 which are introduced by the heading "to/concerning the prophets." There are three reasons why this is the more probable connection: (1) the parallelism in expression with 23:9; (2) the other introductions in vv. 3, 8 use the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la#</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a#l</FONT>) instead of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l=</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">l=</FONT>) used here and they have the formal introduction "you shall say..."; (3) the warning or challenge here would mitigate the judgment pronounced on the king and the city in vv. 4-7. Verses 8-9 are different. They are not a mitigation but an offer of escape for those who surrender. Hence, these words are a title "Now concerning the royal court." (The <i>vav</i> that introduces this is disjunctive = "Now.") However, since the imperative that follows is masculine plural and addressed to the royal house, something needs to be added to introduce it. Hence the translation supplies "The LORD told me to say" to avoid confusion or mistakenly connecting it with the preceding.<br>
 <a name="fn1152" href="jer.htm#fnB1152"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:11)  <i>Heb</i> "house" or "household." It is clear from 22:1-6 that this involved the King, the royal family, and the court officials. <br>

 <a name="fn1155" href="jer.htm#fnB1155"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:12)  The kings of Israel and Judah were responsible for justice. See Pss 122:5. The king himself was the final court of appeals judging from the incident of David with the wise woman of Tekoa (2 Sam 14), Solomon and the two prostitutes (1 Kgs 3:16-28), and Absalom's attempts to win the hearts of the people of Israel by interfering with due process (2 Sam 15:2-4). How the system was designed to operate may be seen from 2 Chr 19:4-11.<br>
 <a name="fn1156" href="jer.htm#fnB1156"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:12)  <i>Heb</i> "from the hand [or power] of."<br>

 <a name="fn1158" href="jer.htm#fnB1158"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:13)  Or "Listen, Jerusalem, you..."; <i>Heb</i> text of v. 21a-b reads, "Behold I am against you [fem. sg.], O inhabitant [fem. sg.] of the valley [and of] the rock of the plain, oracle of the LORD, who are saying [masc. pl.]." Verses 13-14 are generally treated as a separate oracle addressed to Jerusalem. The basis for this is (1) the appropriateness of the description here to the city of Jerusalem; (2) the rather similar reference to Jerusalem smugly living in her buildings made from cedars of Lebanon in 22:23; (3) the use of the second feminine singular pronoun "you" in other places in reference to Jerusalem (cf. clearly in 4:14; 6:8; 13:20; 15:5-6); (4) the use of the feminine singular participle to refer to personified Jerusalem in 10:17 as well as 20:23. However, the description in 21:13 is equally appropriate to the royal household that the LORD has been addressing; the palace stood on the Ophel or fill between the northern and southern hill just south of the temple and overlooked the Kidron valley (For more on the topography of Jerusalem see C. Rasmussen,<i> NIV Atlas of the Bible</i>, pp. 189-200 especially pp. 192-94). Moreover, the word "enthroned" is even more fitting to the royal household than to Jerusalem. The phrase "enthroned above the valley" is literally "inhabitant of the valley." But since the literal is inappropriate for either Jerusalem or the royal palace, the phrase is regularly interpreted after the parallel phrase referring to the LORD "enthroned above the cherubim." The royal house was "enthroned" more literally than Jerusalem was. Taking this to refer to the royal court rather than Jerusalem also introduces one less unintroduced entity by the shift in pronoun in vv. 11-14 as well as eliminating the introduction of an otherwise unintroduced oracle. The "you" of "you brag" is actually the masculine plural participle (<i>Heb</i> "who say") that modifies the feminine singular participle "you who sit enthroned" and goes back to the masculine plural imperatives in v. 12 rather than introducing a new entity, the people of the city. The participle "you who sit enthroned" is to be interpreted as a collective referring to the royal court not a personification of the city of Jerusalem (cf. GKC &#167;122.<i>s</i> and see, e.g., Isa 12:6; Mic 1:11). Moreover, taking the referent to be the royal court makes the reference to the word translated "palace" much more natural. The word is literally "forest" and is often seen to be an allusion to the armory which was called the "Forest of Lebanon" (1 Kgs 7:2; 10:17; 10:21; Isa 22:8 and see also Ezek 17:3 in an allegory (17:2-18) which may have been contemporary with this oracle). Taking the oracle to refer to the royal court also makes this oracle more parallel with the one that follows where destruction of the palace leads also to the destruction of the city.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (21:13)  What is being expressed here is the belief in the inviolability of Zion/Jerusalem gone to seed. Signal deliverances of Jerusalem such as those experienced under Jehoshaphat (2 Chr 20) and Hezekiah (Isa 37:36-37) in the context of promises to protect it (Isa 31:4-5; 37:33-35; 38:6) led to a belief that Zion was unconquerable. This belief found expression in several of Israel's psalms (Pss 46, 48, 76) and led to the mistaken assumption that God would protect it regardless of how the people treated God or one another. Micah and Jeremiah both deny that (cf. Mic 3:8-12; Jer 21:13-14).<br>
 <a name="fn1162" href="jer.htm#fnB1162"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:14)  <i>Heb</i> "oracle of the LORD."<br>

The pronouns are actually third feminine singular going back to the participle "you who sit enthroned above the valley." However, this is another example of those rapid shifts in pronouns typical of the biblical Hebrew style which are uncommon in English. They have regularly been leveled to the same person throughout in the translation to avoid possible confusion for the English reader.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (22:3)  These were classes of people who had no one to look out for their rights. The laws of Israel, however, were careful to see that their rights were guarded (cf. Deut 10:18) and that provision was made for meeting their needs (cf. Deut 24:19-21). The LORD promised to protect them (cf. Ps 146:9) and a curse was called down on any who deprived them of justice (cf. Deut 27:19).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (22:6)  <i>Lebanon</i> was well known for its cedars and the palace (and the temple) had used a good deal of such timber in its construction (see 2 Kgs 5:6, 8-10; 7:2-3). In this section several references are made to cedar (see vv. 7, 14, 15, 23) and allusion has also been made to the paneled and colonnade armory of the Forest of Lebanon (2:14). It appears to have been a source of pride and luxury, perhaps at the expense of justice. Gilead was also noted in antiquity for its forests as well as for its fertile pastures. See C.

 <a name="fn1177" href="jer.htm#fnB1177"><sup>15</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:7)  <i>Heb</i> "I will sanctify destroyers against it." If this is not an attenuated use of the term "sanctify" the traditions of Israel's holy wars are being turned against her. See also 6:4. In Israel's early wars in the wilderness and in the conquest, the LORD fought for her against the enemies (cf., e.g., Josh 10:11, 14, 42; 24:7; Judg 5:20; 1 Sam 7:10). Now he is going to fight against them (21:5, 13) and use the enemy as his instruments of destruction. For a similar picture of destruction in the temple see the lament in Ps 74:3-7.<br>
 <a name="fn1178" href="jer.htm#fnB1178"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:10)  The word "king" is not in the original text of either the first or the third line. It is implicit in the connection and is supplied in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (22:10)  As the next verse makes clear, the king who will never return to see his native land is Shallum, also known as Jehoahaz (cf. 1 Chr 3:15; 2 Kgs 23:30, 33-34). He was made king by popular acclaim after the death of his father, Josiah, who was killed at Megiddo trying to stop Pharaoh Necho from going to the aid of the Assyrians. According to 2 Kgs 23:32 he was a wicked king. He was deposed by Necho and carried into exile where he died. The dead king alluded to is his father, Josiah, who was a godly king and was accordingly spared from seeing the destruction of his land (2 Kgs 22:20).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (22:13)  This was a clear violation of covenant law (cf. Deut 24:14-15) and a violation of the requirements set forth in Jer 22:3. The allusion is to Jehoiakim who is not mentioned until v. 18. He was placed on the throne by Pharaoh Necho and ruled from 609-598 B.C. He became a vassal of Nebuchadnezzar but rebelled against him, bringing about the siege of 597 B.C. in which his son and many of the Judean leaders were carried off to Babylon (2 Kgs 23:34-24:16). He was a wicked king according to the author of the book of Kings (2 Kgs 23:37). He had Uriah the prophet killed (Jer 26:23) and showed no regard for Jeremiah's prophecies, destroying the scroll containing them (Jer 36:23) and ordering Jeremiah's arrest (Jer 36:23).<br>

The latter form then parallels the form for "paints" and functions in the same way (cf. GKC &#167;113.<i>z</i> for the infinitive with <i>vav</i> continuing a perfect).

The copulative <i>vav</i> in front of the verbs here (all Hebrew perfects) shows that these actions are all coordinate not sequential (see <i>IBHS</i> &#167;33.1.1a, p. 520). The contrast drawn here between the actions of Jehoiakim and Josiah show that the phrase eating and drinking should be read in the light of the same contrasts in Eccl 2 which ends with the note of contentment in Eccl 2:24 (see also Eccl 3:13; 5:18 [5:17 HT]; 8:15). The question is, of course, rhetorical setting forth the positive role model against which Jehoiakim's actions are to be condemned. The key terms here are "then things went well with him" which is repeated in the next verse after the reiteration of Josiah's practice of justice.<br>

The word "know" is used in ancient Near Eastern treaty contexts of submission to the will of the overlord. See further the notes on 9:3.<br>

 <a name="fn1192" href="jer.htm#fnB1192"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:18)  The translation follows the majority of scholars who think that the address of brother and sister are the address of the mourners to one another, lamenting their loss. Some scholars feel that all four terms are parallel and represent the relation that the king had metaphorically to his subjects; i.e., he was not only Lord and Majesty to them but like a sister or a brother. In that case something like: "How sad it is for the one who was like a brother to us! How sad it is for the one who was like a sister to us." This makes for poor poetry and is not very likely. The lover can call his bride sister in Song of Solomon (Song 4:9, 10) but there are no documented examples of a subject ever speaking of a king in this way in Israel or the ancient Near East.<br>
 <a name="fn1193" href="jer.htm#fnB1193"><sup>31</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:19)  A similar judgment against this ungodly king is pronounced by Jeremiah in 36:30. According to 2 Chr 36:6 he was bound over to be taken captive to Babylon but apparently died before he got there. According to the Jewish historian Josephus, Nebuchadnezzar ordered his body thrown outside the wall in fulfillment of this judgment. The Bible itself, however, does not tell us that.<br>

The second feminine singular has commonly been applied to Jerusalem or the people of Judah throughout the book. The reference to allies (v. 20, 22) and to leaders (v. 22) make it very probable that this is the case here too. <br>

For the use of the word "wind" as a metaphor or simile for God's judgment (using the enemy forces) see 4:11-12; 13:24; 18:17. For the use of the word "shepherd" to refer to rulers/leaders 2:8; 10:21; and 23:1-4. For the use of the word "shepherd away" in the sense of carry off/drive away see BDB 945 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hu*r&#180;</FONT> 2.d and compare Job 20:26. There is an obvious wordplay involved in two different senses of the word "shepherd," one referring to their leaders and one referring to the loss of those leaders by the wind driving them off. There may even be a further play involving the word "wickedness" which comes from a word having the same consonants. If the oracles in this section are chronologically ordered this threat was fulfilled in 597 B.C. when many of the royal officials and nobles were carried away captive with Jehoachin (see 2 Kgs 24:15) who is the subject of the next oracle.<br>

Some even interpret this as a reference to the king who has been characterized as living in a cedar palace, in a veritable Lebanon (cf. vv. 6-7, 14 and see also the alternate interpretation of 21:13-14). However, the reference to "nesting in the cedars" and the earlier reference to "feeling secure" suggests that the figure is rather like that of Ezek 31:6 and Dan 4:12. See also Hab 2:9 where a related figure is used. The forms for "you who dwell" and "you who are nested" in the literal translation are feminine singular participles referring again to personified Jerusalem. (The written forms of these participles are to be explained as participles with a <i>hireq campaginis </i>according to GKC &#167;90.<i>m</i>.

Elsewhere in Jeremiah he is called Jeconiah (24:1; 27:20; 28:4; 29:2 [see also 1 Chr 3:16, 17; Esth 2:6]) and Jehoaichin (52:31, 33 [see also 2 Kgs 24:6, 8, 12, 15; 25:27, 29; 2 Chr 36:8, 9; Ezek 1:2]). For the sake of consistency the present translation uses the name Jeconiah throughout.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (22:24)  According to 2 Kgs 24:8-9 <i>Jeconiah</i> (= Jehoiachin) succeeded his father Jehoiakim and evidently followed in his anti-Babylon, anti-God stance. He surrendered to Nebuchadnezzar shortly after he became king and along with his mother, his family, his officials, and some of the leading men of Jerusalem and Judah was carried into exile in 597 B.C. According to Jer 28:4, 10, there were popular hopes that he would be restored from exile and returned to the throne. This oracle flatly denies that hope. Allusion has already been made to the loss of regal authority by this king and his mother in 13:18-19.<br>
 <a name="fn1206" href="jer.htm#fnB1206"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:24)  <i>Heb</i> "As surely as I live, Jeconiah, King of Judah, son of Jehoiakim will not be a signet ring on my right hand. Indeed I will tear you off from it [i.e., pull you off of my finger as a signet ring]." The signet ring was the king's seal by which he verified all his legal and political transactions. To have the signet ring was to exercise authority in the king's name. For examples of this see Gen 41:42, 43; 1 Kgs 21:8; Est 3:10; 8:2. The figure has been interpreted in the translation for the sake of clarity. The particles <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;a! yK!</FONT> that stand after the oath formula, "As I live" introduce a negative statement according to the usage of Hebrew grammar (cf. BDB 474 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;a! yK!</FONT> 1.a and BDB 50 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;a!</FONT> 1.b[2] and compare 2 Sam 3:35).

BDB 472 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> 1.c and compare 1 Sam 14:39, 44). The LORD is swearing emphatically that Jeconiah will not be the earthly representative of his rule; i.e., not carry the authority of the signet ring bearer. As in several other places in Jeremiah there is a sudden shift from the third person to the second person which runs throughout vv. 24-27. The pronouns are leveled in the translation to the second person to avoid confusion. The figures are interpreted in the translation to convey the proper significance. See the study note for explanation.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (22:24)  According to the Davidic covenant the Davidic king sat on God's throne over God's kingdom, Israel (cf. 2 Chr 29:30; 28:5). As God's representative he ruled in God's stead and could even be addressed figuratively as God (cf. Ps 45:6 [45:7 HT]) and compare the same phenomenon for the earthly judges, Exod 22:7-8; Ps 82:1, 6). Jeconiah is being denied the right to function any longer as the Davidic king and any hopes of ever regaining that right in his lifetime or through the succession of his sons is also denied. This oracle is reversed by the later oracle of the prophet Haggai to his grandson Zerubbabel in Hag 2:20-23 and both Jeconiah and Zerubbabel are found in the genealogy of Christ in Matt 1:12-13.<br>

 <a name="fn1210" href="jer.htm#fnB1210"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:28)  The word translated "clay vessel" occurs only here. Its meaning, however, is assured on the basis of the parallelism and on the basis of the verb root which is used for shaping or fashioning in Job 10:8. The KJV renders it as "idol," but that word, while having the same consonants, never appears in the singular. The word is missing in the Greek version but is translated "vessel" in the Latin version. The word "clay" is supplied in the translation to clarify what sort of vessel is meant; its inclusion is justified based on the context and the use of the same verb root in Job 10:8 to refer to shaping or fashioning, which would imply clay pots or vessels.<br>
 <a name="fn1211" href="jer.htm#fnB1211"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:28)  <i>Heb</i> "Is this man, Coniah, a despised, broken vessel or a vessel that no one wants?" The question is rhetorical expecting a positive answer in agreement with the preceding oracle.<br>

 <a name="fn1212" href="jer.htm#fnB1212"><sup>50</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:28)  The question "Why?" is a common rhetorical feature in the book of Jeremiah. See Jer 2:14, 31; 8:5, 19, 22; 12:1; 13:22; 14:19. In several cases like this one no answer is given, leaving a sense of exasperation and hopelessness with the sinfulness of the nation that calls forth such punishment from God.<br>
 <a name="fn1213" href="jer.htm#fnB1213"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:29)  There is no certain explanation for the triple repetition of the word "land" here. Huey, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 209 suggests the idea of exasperation, but exasperation at what? Their continued apostasy which made these exiles necessary? Or exasperation at their pitiful hopes of seeing Jeconiah restored? Perhaps "pitiful, pitiful, pitiful land of Judah" would convey some of the force of the repetition without being any more suggestive of why the land is so addressed.<br>
 <a name="fn1214" href="jer.htm#fnB1214"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:30)  <i>Heb</i> "Write this man childless." For the explanation see the study note. The word translated "childless" has spawned some debate because Jeconiah was in fact not childless. There is record from both the Bible and ancient Near Eastern texts that he had children (see, e.g., 1 Chr 3:17). G.R. Driver, "Linguistic and Textual Problems: Jeremiah," JQR NS28 (1937-38):115 has suggested that the word both here and in Lev 20:20-21 should be translated "stripped of honor." While that would relieve some of the difficulties here, the word definitely means "childless" in Gen 15:2 and also in Sir 16:3 where it is contrasted with having godless children. The issue is not one of childlessness but of having "one of his sons" succeed to the Davidic throne. The term for "one of his sons" is literally "from his seed a man" and the word "seed" is the same one that is used to refer to his "children" who were forced into exile with him (v. 28).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (22:30)  The figure here is of registering a person on an official roll of citizens, etc. (cf. Num 11:26; 1 Chr 4:41; Ps 87:6). Here it probably refers to the "king list" of dynastic succession. While Jeconiah did have children (2 Chr 3:17) none of them ever returned to Judah or ruled over it. What is being denied here is his own succession and that of his immediate sons contrary to the popular hopes expressed in Jer 28:4. His grandson Zerubbabel did return to Judah, became governor (Hag 1:1; 2:2), and along with the high priest Joshua was responsible for rebuilding the second temple (e.g., Ezra 5:2).<br>

 <a name="fn1216" href="jer.htm#fnB1216"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (23:1)  <i>Heb</i> This particle once again introduces a judgment speech. The indictment is found in v. 1 and the announcement of judgment in v. 2. This leads into an oracle of deliverance in vv. 3-4. See also the note on the word "judged" in 22:13.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (23:1)  Verses 1-4 of ch. 23 are an extended metaphor in which the rulers are compared to shepherds and the people are compared to sheep. This metaphor has already been met with in 10:21 and is found elsewhere in the context of the LORD's covenant with David (cf. 2 Sam 7:7-8; Ps 78:70-72). The sheep are God's people and he is the ultimate shepherd who is personally concerned about their care (cf. Pss 23:1; 80:2). He has set rulers over them as his under-shepherds and they are responsible to him for the care of his sheep (see 22:3-4). They have been lax shepherds, allowing the sheep to be scattered and destroyed. So he will punish them. As the true shepherd of Israel he will regather his scattered flock and place new shepherds (rulers) over them. These verses lead to a promise of an ideal ruler set over an Israel which has experienced a new and better Exodus (vv. 6-8). For a more complete development of this metaphor with similar messianic and eschatological implications see Ezek 34. The metaphor has been interpreted in the translation but some of the flavor left in the simile.<br>

Behold I will visit upon you the evil of your deeds." "Therefore" announces the judgment which does not come until "Behold." It is interrupted by the messenger formula and a further indictment. The original has been broken up to conform more to contemporary English style, the metaphors have been interpreted for clarity and the connections between the indictments and the judgments have been carried by "So."<br>

 <b>sn</b> (23:4)  There is an extended play on the Hebrew word <i>paqad</i> which is a word with rather broad English equivalents. Here the word refers to the fault of the shepherds/rulers who have not "taken care" of the sheep/people (v. 2), the "punishment" for the evil they have done in not taking care of them(v. 2), and the fact that after the LORD assigns new shepherds/rulers over them they will be cared for in such a way that none of them "will turn up missing" (v. 4).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (23:5)  This passage and the parallel in Jer 33:15 are part of a growing number of prayers and prophecies regarding an ideal ruler to come forth from the Davidic line who will bring the justice, security, and well being that the continuing line of Davidic rulers did not. Though there were periodic kings like Josiah who did fulfill the ideals set forth in Jer 22:3 (see Jer 22:15), by and large they were more like Jehoiakim who did not (see Jer 22:13). Hence the LORD brought to an end the Davidic rule. The potential for the ideal, however, remained because of God's promise to David (2 Sam 7:16). The Davidic line became like a tree which was cut down, leaving only a stump. But from that stump God would bring forth a "shoot," a "sprig" which would fulfill the ideals of kingship. See Isa 11:1-6 and Zech 3:8, 6:12 for this metaphor and compare Dan 4:14-15, 23, 26 for a different but related use of the metaphor.<br>
 <a name="fn1229" href="jer.htm#fnB1229"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:5)  <i>Heb</i> "he will reign as king and act wisely." This is another example of the use of two verbs joined by "and" where one becomes the adverbial modifier of the other (hendiadys). For the nuance of the verb "act wisely" rather than "prosper" see Amos 5:13; Ps 2:10 (cf. BDB 968 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lk^c*</FONT> Hiph 5).<br>
 <a name="fn1230" href="jer.htm#fnB1230"><sup>16</sup></a><b>sn</b> (23:5)  This has been the constant emphasis in this section. See 22:3 for the demand, 22:15 for its fulfillment, and 22:13 for its abuse. The ideal king would follow in the footsteps of his illustrious ancestor David (2 Sam 8:15) who set this forth as an ideal for his dynasty (2 Sam 23:3) and prayed for it to be true of his son Solomon (Ps 72:1-2).<br>
 <a name="fn1231" href="jer.htm#fnB1231"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:6)  <i>Heb</i> "In his days [= during the time he rules]."<br>
 <a name="fn1232" href="jer.htm#fnB1232"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:6)  Parallelism and context (cf. v. 4) suggest this nuance for the word often translated "be saved."

 <a name="fn1233" href="jer.htm#fnB1233"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (23:6)  It should be noted that this brief oracle of deliverance implies the reunification of Israel and Judah under the future Davidic ruler. Jeremiah has already spoken about this reunification earlier in 3:18 and will have more to say about it in 30:3; 31:27, 31. This same ideal was espoused in the prophecies of Hosea (1:10-11 [2:1-2 HT]), Isaiah (11:1-4, 10-12), and Ezekiel (37:15-28) all of which have messianic and eschatological significance.<br>
 <a name="fn1234" href="jer.htm#fnB1234"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:6)  <i>Heb</i> "his name will be called `The LORD our righteousness'."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (23:6)  The Hebrew word translated "justice" here is very broad in its usage, and it is hard to catch all the relevant nuances for this word in this context. It is used for "vindication" in legal contexts (see, e.g., Job 6:29), for "deliverance" or "salvation" in exilic contexts (see, e.g., Isa 58:8), and in the sense of ruling, judging with "justice" (see, e.g., Lev 19:15; Isa 32:1). Here it probably sums up the justice that the LORD provides through raising up this ruler as well as the safety, security, and well-being that result (see vv. 5-6a). In the NT this takes on soteriological connotations (see 1 Cor 1:31 in its context).<br>

 <a name="fn1238" href="jer.htm#fnB1238"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tc</b> (23:8)  It is probably preferable to read the third masculine singular plus suffix (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;j*yD]h!</FONT>) here with the Greek version and the parallel passage in 16:15 rather than the first singular plus suffix in the Masoretic Text (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yT!j=D~h!</FONT>). If this is not a case of mere graphic confusion, the Masoretic Text could have arisen under the influence of the first person in v. 3. Though sudden shifts in person have been common in the book of Jeremiah, that is unlikely in a context reporting an oath.<br>
 <a name="fn1239" href="jer.htm#fnB1239"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:8)  This passage is the same as 16:14-15 with a few minor variations in Hebrew wording. The notes on that passage should be consulted for the rendering here. This passage has the Niphal of the verb "to say" rather than the impersonal use of the Qal. It adds the idea of "bringing out" to the idea of "bringing up out" and (<i>Heb</i> "who brought up and who brought out," probably a case of hendiadys) before "the people [here "seed" rather than "children"] of Israel [here "house of Israel"] from the land of the north." These are minor variations and do not affect the sense in any way. So the passage is rendered in much the same way.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (23:8)  This passage looks forward to a new and greater Exodus, one that so outstrips the earlier one that the earlier will not serve as the model of deliverance any longer. This same ideal was the subject of Isaiah's earlier prophecies in Isa 11:11-12, 15-16; 43:16-21; 49:8-13; 51: 1-11.<br>
 <a name="fn1240" href="jer.htm#fnB1240"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (23:8)  Jeremiah has already had a good deal to say about the false prophets and their fate. See 2:8, 26; 5:13, 31; 14:13-15.

It has already been noted several times that the "heart" in ancient Hebrew psychology was the intellectual and volitional center of the person, the kidneys were the emotional center, and the bones the locus of strength and also the subject of joy, distress, and sorrow. Here Jeremiah is speaking of his distress of heart and mind in modern psychology, a distress that leads him to trembling of body which he compares to that of a drunken person staggering around under the influence of wine.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (23:10)  The <i>curse</i> is, of course, the covenant curse. See Deut 29:20-21 (29:19-20 HT) and for the specific curse see Deut 28:23-24. The curse is appropriate since their "adultery" lay in attributing their fertility to the god Baal (see Hos 2:9-13 (2:11-15 HT) and violating the covenant (see Hos 4:1-3).<br>

However, the connection is too distant to render it "for." "Moreover" is intended to draw the parallel. The words "the LORD says" (<i>Heb</i> "Oracle of the LORD") have been drawn up to the front to introduce the shift in speaker from Jeremiah, who describes his agitated state, to God, who describes the sins of the prophets and priests and his consequent judgment on them.<br>

 <a name="fn1255" href="jer.htm#fnB1255"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:13)  Literally "by Baal."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (23:13)  Prophesying <i>in the name of the god Baal</i> was a clear violation of Mosaic law and punishable by death (see Deut 13:1-5). For an example of the apostasy encouraged by prophets of Baal in the northern kingdom of Israel see 1 Kgs 18:16-40.<br>
 <a name="fn1256" href="jer.htm#fnB1256"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:14)  Or "they commit adultery and deal falsely." The word "shocking" only occurs here and in 5:30 where it is found in the context of prophesying lies. This almost assures that the reference to "walking in lies" (<i>Heb</i> "in the lie") is referring to false prophesy. Moreover the references to the prophets in 5:13 and in 14:13-15 are all in the context of false prophesy as are the following references in this chapter in 23:24, 26, 32 and in 28:15. This appears to be the theme of this section. This also makes it likely that the reference to adultery is not literal adultery, though two of the false prophets in Babylon were guilty of this (29:23). The reference to "encouraging those who do evil" that follows also makes more sense if they were preaching messages of comfort rather than messages of doom. The verbs here are infinitive absolutes in place of the finite verb are probable to place greater emphasis on the action. (See <i>IBHS</i> &#167;35.5.2, p. 595 and compare Hos 4:2 in a comparable judgment speech.)<br>
 <a name="fn1257" href="jer.htm#fnB1257"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:14)  Literally "So they strengthen the hands of those doing evil so that they do not turn back from their evil." For the use of the figure "strengthen the hands" meaning "encourage" see Judg 9:24; Ezek 13:22 (and cf. BDB 304 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qz~j*</FONT> Piel 2). The <i>vav</i> consecutive on the front of the form gives the logical consequence equivalent to "so" in the translation.<br>
 <a name="fn1258" href="jer.htm#fnB1258"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:14)  <i>Heb</i> "All of them are to me like Sodom and its [Jerusalem's] inhabitants like Gomorrah."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (23:14)  The rhetoric of this passage is very forceful. Like Amos who focuses attention on the sins of the surrounding nations to bring out more forcefully the heinousness of Israel's sin, God focuses attention on the sins of the prophets of Samaria to bring out the even worse sin of the prophets of Jerusalem. (The oracle is directed at them, not at the prophets of Samaria. See the announcement of judgment that follows.) The LORD has already followed that tack with Judah in Jeremiah 2 (cf. 2:11). Moreover, he here compares the prophets and the evil-doing citizens of Jerusalem, whom they were encouraging through their false prophesy, to the people of Sodom and Gomorrah who were proverbial for their wickedness (Deut 32:32; Isa 1:10).<br>

 <a name="fn1261" href="jer.htm#fnB1261"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:15)  <i>Heb</i> "I am going to feed this people wormwood and make them drink poison water." For these same words of judgment on another group see 9:15 (9:14 HT). "Wormwood" and "poison water" are not to be understood literally here but are symbolic of judgment and suffering.

 <a name="fn1263" href="jer.htm#fnB1263"><sup>49</sup></a><b>sn</b> (23:15)  A word that derives from this same Hebrew word is used in v. 11 at the beginning of the LORD's criticism of the prophet and priest.

The Greek version is to be preferred here because of (1) the parallelism of the lines "reject what the LORD has said" // "follow the stubborn inclinations of their own hearts;" (2) the preceding context which speaks of "visions of their own imaginations not of what the LORD has given them;" (3) the following context which denies that they have ever had access to the LORD's secrets; (4) the general contexts earlier regarding false prophecy where rejection of the LORD's word is in view (6:14 [see there v. 10]; 8:11 [see there v. 9]); (5) the meter of the poetic lines (the Hebrew meter is 3/5/4/3; the meter presupposed by the translation is 5/3/4/3 with the 3's being their words). The difference is one of vocalization of the same consonants (Hebrew: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwhy rB#D] yx^a&amp;n~m=</FONT> and the Greek: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwhy rb^D+ yx@a&amp;n~m=</FONT>).<br>

They and those they prophesied to will find out soon enough what the purposes of his heart are, and they are not "peace" (see v. 20).

Both here and in 30:23 where these same words occur the word "anger" stands not as an accusative of attendant circumstance but an apposition, giving the intended referent to the figure. Comparison should be made with Jer 25:15 where "this wrath" is appositional to "the cup of wine" (cf. GKC &#167;121.<i>k</i>).<br>

However, the <i>hey</i> interrogative (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">h^</FONT>) at the beginning of this verse and the particle (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;a!</FONT>) at the beginning of the next show that the linkage is between the question in v. 23 and that in v. 24a.

 <b>sn</b> (23:23)  The thought that is expressed here must be viewed against the background of ancient Near Eastern thought where gods were connected with different realms, e.g., Baal, the god of wind, rain, and fertility, Mot, the god of drought, infertility, and death, Yam, the god of the sea and of chaos. Moreover, Baal was worshiped in local manifestations as the Baal of Peor, Baal of Gad, etc. Hence, Baal is sometimes spoken of in the singular and sometimes in the plural. The LORD is the one true God (Deut 6:4). Moreover, he is the maker of heaven and earth (Gen 14:12; 2 Kgs 19:15; Ps 115:15), sees into the hearts of all men (Ps 33:13-15), and judges men according to what they do (Ezek 7:3, 7, 27). There is no hiding from him (Job 34:22; Ps 139:7-12) and no escape from his judgment (Amos 9:2-4). God has already spoken to the people and their leaders through Jeremiah along these lines (Jer 16:17; 21:14). Lurking behind the thoughts expressed here is probably Deut 29:19-21 where God warns that one "bad apple" who thinks he can get away with sinning against the covenant can lead to the destruction of all. The false prophets were the "bad apples" that were encouraging the corruption of the whole nation by their words promoting a false sense of security unconnected with loyalty to God and obedience to his covenant. The first question deals with the issue of God's transcendence, the second with his omniscience, and the third with his omnipresence.<br>

What was illegitimate was to use the dream to lead people away from the LORD (Deut 13:1-5 [13:2-6 HT]). That was what the prophets were doing through their dreams which were "lies" and "the delusions of their own minds." Through them they were making people forget who the LORD really was which was just like what their ancestors had done through worshiping Baal.<br>

Verses 26-27 read somewhat literally, "How long is there in the hearts of the prophets who are prophesying the lie and [in the hearts of] the prophets of the delusions of their [own] heart the plotting to cause my people to forget my name..." Most commentaries complain that the text is corrupt, that there is no subject for "is there." However, the long construct qualification "in the hearts of" has led to the lack of observation that the proper subject is "the plotting to make my people forget." There are no exact parallels but Jer 14:22; Neh 5:5 follow the same structure. The "How long" precedes the other means of asking a question for the purpose of emphasis (cf. BDB 210 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">h&amp;</FONT> 1.b and compare for example the usage in 2 Sam 7:7). There has also been a failure to see that "the prophets of the delusion of..." is a parallel construct noun after "heart of." Stripping the syntax down to its barest minimum and translating literally, the sentence would read "How long will the plotting...continue in the hearts of the prophets who...and [in hearts of] the prophets of..." The sentence has been restructured in the translation to conform to contemporary English style but attempt has been made to maintain the same subordinations.<br>

To speak in someone's name was to act as his representative or carry his authority (1 Sam 25:9; 1 Kgs 21:8). To call someone's name over something was to claim it for one's own (2 Sam 28:8). Hence, here to forget the name is equivalent to forgetting who he was in his essential character (cf. Exod 3:13-15; 6:3; 34:5-7). By preaching lies they had obliterated part of his essential character and caused people to forget who he really was.<br>

 <a name="fn1301" href="jer.htm#fnB1301"><sup>87</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:31)  The word "The LORD" is not actually in the text but is implicit in the idiom. It is generally supplied in all the translations.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (23:31)  Jer 23:30-33 are filled with biting sarcasm. The verses all begin with "Behold I am against the prophets who..." and go on to describe their reprehensible behavior. They "steal" one another's messages which the LORD sarcastically calls "my words" (The passage shows that they are not; compare Marc Anthony's use of "noble" to describe the ignoble men who killed Caesar). Here the use of the idiom translated "to use their own tongue" is really the idiom that refers to taking something in preparation for action, i.e., "they take <i>their</i> tongue" and "declare." The verb "declare" is only used here and is derived from the idiom "oracle of " which is almost universally used in the idiom "oracle of the LORD" which occurs 176 times in Jeremiah. I.e., it is their tongue that is "declaring not his mouth (v. 16). Moreover in the report of what they "declare" the LORD has left out the qualifying "of the LORD" to suggest the delusive nature of their message, i.e. they mislead people into believing that their message is from the LORD. Elsewhere in the discussion of the issue of false prophecy the LORD will use the full formula (Ezek 13:6-7). How ironic that their "Oracle of..." is punctuated by the triple "Oracle of the LORD" (vv. 30, 31, 32; translated here "I, the LORD, affirm that...).<br>

They are supplied in the translation for clarity to show the shift between the LORD addressing the people (second masculine plural) and the LORD addressing Jeremiah (second masculine singular).<br>
 <a name="fn1307" href="jer.htm#fnB1307"><sup>93</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:33)  The meaning of vv. 33-40 is debated. The translation given here follows the general direction of NRSV and REB rather than that of NIV and the related direction taken by NCV and God's Word. The meaning of vv. 33-40 are debated because of (1) the ambiguity involved in the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aC*m*</FONT>, which can mean either "burden" (as something carried or weighing heavily on a person; see, e.g., Exod 23:5; Num 4:27; 2 Sam 15:33; Ps 38:4) or "oracle" (of doom; see, e. g., Isa 13:1; Nah 1:1); (the translation is debated due to etymological concerns), (2) the ambiguity of the line in v. 36 which has been rendered "For what is `burdensome' really pertains rather to what a person himself says" (<i>Heb</i> "the burden is to the man his word"), and (3) the text in v. 33 of "you are the burden." Many commentaries see a wordplay on the two words "burden" and "oracle" which are homonyms. However, from the contrasts that are drawn in the passage, it is doubtful whether the nuance of "oracle" ever is in view. The word is always used in the prophets of an oracle of doom or judgment; it is not merely revelation of God which one of the common people would have been uttering (contra NIV). Jeremiah never uses the word in that sense nor does anyone else in the book of Jeremiah.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (23:33)  What is in view here is the idea that the people consider Jeremiah's views of loyalty to God and obedience to the covenant "burdensome." I.e., what burdensome demands is the LORD asking you to impose on us (See Jer 17:21, 22, 24, 27 where this same word is used regarding Sabbath observance which they chafed at.). The LORD answers back that it is not he who is being burdensome to them; they are burdensome to him (See 15:6: "I am weary" and compare Isa 1:14 where the verb rather than the noun is used.).<br>
 <a name="fn1308" href="jer.htm#fnB1308"><sup>94</sup></a><b>tc</b> (23:33)  The translation follows the Latin and Greek versions. The Hebrew text reads "What burden [i.e., burdensome message]?" The syntax of "what message?" is not in itself objectionable; the interrogative can function as an adjective (cf.BDB 552 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*</FONT> 1.a[a]). What is objectionable to virtually all the commentaries and lexicons is the unparalleled use of the accusative particle in front of the interrogative and the noun (see, e.g., BDB 672 s.v. III <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aC*m*</FONT> and GKC &#167;117.<i>m</i> note). The emendation only involves the redivision and revocalization of the same consonants: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aC*m^-hm^-ta#</FONT> becomes <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aC*M*h^ &lt;T#a^</FONT>. This also makes a much more natural connection for the <i>vav</i> consecutive perfect that follows (cf. GKC &#167;112.<i>x</i> and compare Isa 6:7; Judg 13:3).<br>
 <a name="fn1309" href="jer.htm#fnB1309"><sup>95</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:33)  The meaning "cast you away" is questioned by some because the word is regularly used of "forsaking" or "abandoning" (see, e.g., Jer 7:29; 12:7; 15:6). However, it is clearly use of "casting down" or "throwing away" in Ezek 29:5; 32:4 and that meaning is virtually assured in v. 39 where the verb is combined with the phrase "from my presence" which is elsewhere used in rejection contexts with verbs like "send away," "throw out," or "remove" (see BDB 819 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hn\P*</FONT> II.8.a). This is another example of the bracketing effect of a key word and should be rendered the same in the two passages. Moreover, it fits in nicely with the play on "burden" here.<br>
 <a name="fn1310" href="jer.htm#fnB1310"><sup>96</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:33)  <i>Heb</i> "Oracle of the LORD."<br>

This is an example of the Hebrew construction call nominative absolute or <i>casus pendens</i> (cf. GKC &#167;143.<i>d</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn1313" href="jer.htm#fnB1313"><sup>99</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:35)  The words "So, I, Jeremiah tell you" are not in the text.

 <a name="fn1314" href="jer.htm#fnB1314"><sup>100</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:35)  This line is sometimes rendered as a description of what the people are doing (cf. NIV). However, repetition with some slight modification referring to the prophet in v. 37 followed by the same kind of prohibition that follows here shows that what is being contrasted is two views toward the LORD's message, i.e., one of openness to receive what the LORD says through the prophet and one that already characterizes the LORD's message as a burden. Allusion to the question that started the discussion in v. 33 should not be missed. The prophet alluded to is Jeremiah. He is being indirect in his reference to himself.<br>

 <a name="fn1317" href="jer.htm#fnB1317"><sup>103</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:36)  <i>Heb</i> "The burden is [or, will be] to a man his word." There is a good deal of ambiguity regarding how this line is to be rendered. For the major options and the issues involved W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 1:651-52 should be consulted. Most of them are excluded by the observation that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aC*m^</FONT> probably does not mean "oracle" anywhere in this passage (see note on v. 33 regarding the use of this word). Hence it does not mean "every man's word becomes his oracle" as in NIV or "for that `burden' [= oracle] is what he entrusts to the man of his word" (McKane, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 1:600-601). The latter is also ruled out by the fact that the antecedent of "his" on "his word" is clearly the word "man" in front of it. This would be the only case where the phrase "man of his word" occurs. There is also no textual reason for repointing the noun with the article as the noun with the interrogative to read "For how can his word become a burden to anyone?" There are, of course, other options but this is sufficient to show that the translation has been chosen after looking at other alternatives.<br>

The first "therefore" picks up the "if" (BDB 487 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/K@</FONT> 3.d) and the second answer the "because" (BDB 774 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/u^y~</FONT> 1).<br>
 <a name="fn1322" href="jer.htm#fnB1322"><sup>108</sup></a><b>tc</b> (23:39)  The translation follows a few Hebrew MSS and the major versions.

While the verb "forget" would not be totally inappropriate here it does not fit the concept of "throwing away from my presence" as well as "pick up" does. For the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ac*n&#180;</FONT> meaning "carry you off" compare the usage in 1 Kgs 15:22; 18:12 (and see BDB 671 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ac*n&#180;</FONT> 3.b). Many see the nuance "pick you up" carrying through on the wordplay in v. 33. While that may be appropriate for the repetition of the verb "throw away" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vf^n&#180;</FONT>) that follows, it does not seem as appropriate for the use of the infinitive absolute that follows the verb which expresses some kind of forcefulness (see GKC &#167;113.<i>q</i>).<br>

The term "work of your own hands" is often interpreted as a reference to idolatry as is clearly the case in Isa 2:8; 37:19.

He was the LORD's servant in that he was the agent used by the LORD to punish his disobedient people. Assyria was earlier referred to as the LORD's "rod" (Isa 10:5-6) and Cyrus is called his "shepherd" and his "anointed" (Isa 44:28; 45:1). Craigie, Kelly, Drinkard make the interesting observation that the terms here are very similar to the terms in v. 4 (<i>Jeremiah 1-25</i>,<i> </i>p. 364). The people of Judah ignored the servants, the prophets, he sent to turn them away from evil. So he will send other servants whom they cannot ignore.<br>
 <a name="fn1359" href="jer.htm#fnB1359"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:9)  The word used here was used in the early years of Israel's conquest for the action of killing all the men, women, and children in the cities of Canaan, destroying all their livestock, and burning their cities down. This policy was intended to prevent Israel from being corrupted by paganism (Deut 7:2; 20:17-18; Josh 6:18, 21). It was to be extended to any city that led Israel away from worshiping God (Deut 13:15) and any Israelite who brought an idol into his house (Deut 7:26). Here the policy is being directed against Judah as well as against her neighbors because of her persistent failure to heed God's warnings through the prophets. For further usage of this term in application to foreign nations in the book of Jeremiah see 50:21, 26; 51:3.<br>

However, it sometimes has a more limited time reference. For example it refers to the lifetime of a person who became a "lasting slave" to another person (see Exod 21:6; Deut 15:17). It is also used to refer to the long life wished for a king (1 Kgs 1:31; Neh 2:3). The time frame here is to be qualified at least with reference to Judah and Jerusalem as seventy years (see 29:10-14 and compare v. 12).<br>

Though several proposals have been made for dating this period, many ignore this fact. This most likely refers to the period beginning with Nebuchadnezzar's defeat of Pharaoh Necho at Carcemish in 605 B.C. and the beginning of his rule over Babylon. At this time Babylon became the dominant force in the area and continued to be so until the fall of Babylon in 538 B.C. More particularly Judah became a vassal state (cf. Jer 46:2; 2 Kgs 24:1) in 605 B.C. and was allowed to return to her homeland in 538 when Cyrus issued his edict allowing all the nations exiled by Babylon to return to their homelands. (See 2 Chr 36:21 and Ezra 1:2-4; the application there is made to Judah but the decree of Cyrus was broader.)<br>

I will bring upon it everything that Jeremiah is going to prophesy concerning all the nations." The reference to "this book" and "what Jeremiah has prophesied against the nations" raises issues about the editorial process underlying the current form of the book of Jeremiah. As the book now stands there is no earlier reference to any judgments against Babylon or any book (really "scroll"; books were a development of the first or second century A.D.) containing them. A common assumption is that this "book" of judgment refers to the judgments against Babylon and the other nations contained at the end of the book of Jeremiah (46:1-51:58). The Greek version actually inserts the prophecies of 46:1-51:58 here (but in a different order) and interprets "Which (= What) Jeremiah prophesied concerning all the nations" as a title. It is possible that the Greek version may represent an earlier form of the book. At least two earlier forms of the book are known that date roughly to the period dealt with here (Compare 36:1 with 25:1 and see 36:2, 4 and 36:28, 32). Whether reference here is made to the first or second of these scrolls and whether the Greek version represents either is impossible to determine. It is not inconceivable that the referent here is the prophecies which Jeremiah has already uttered in vv. 8-12 and is about to utter in conjunction with the symbolical act that the LORD commands him to perform (vv. 15-26, 30-38) and that these are proleptic of the latter prophecies which will be given later and will be incorporated in a future book. That is the tenor of the alternate translation. The verb forms involved are capable of either a past/perfect translation or a proleptic/future translation. For the use of the participle (in the alternate translation = <i>Heb </i>"that is to be written"; <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWtK*h^</FONT>) to refer to what is proleptic see GKC &#167;116.<i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, and compare usage in Jonah 1:3; 2 Kgs 11:2. For the use of the perfect to refer to a future act (in the alternate translation "is going to prophesy", <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aB*n]</FONT>) see GKC &#167;106.<i>m</i> and compare usage in Judg 1:2. In support of this interpretation is the fact that the first verb in the next verse (<i>Heb </i>"they will be subjected", <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wdb=u*</FONT>) is undoubtedly prophetic [it is followed by a <i>vav</i> consecutive perfect; cf. GKC &#167;1125 and Isa 5:14]). Reading the text this way has the advantage of situating it within the context of the passage itself which involves prophecies against the nations and against Babylon. Babylon is both the agent of wrath (the cup from which the nations drink, cf. 51:7) and the recipient of it (cf. v. 26). However, this interpretation admittedly does not explain the reference to "this book," except as a proleptic reference to some future form of the book and there would be clearer ways of expressing this view if that were what was definitely intended.<br>
 <a name="fn1372" href="jer.htm#fnB1372"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:14)  <i>Heb</i> "make slaves of them." The verb form here indicates that the action is as good as done (the Hebrew prophetic perfect). For the use of the verb rendered "makes slaves" see parallel usage in Lev 25:39, 46 (cf. BDB 713 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">db^u*</FONT> 3).<br>
 <a name="fn1373" href="jer.htm#fnB1373"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:14)  <i>Heb</i> "according to their deeds and according to the work of their hands." The two phrases are synonymous; it would be hard to represent them both in translation without being redundant. The translation attempts to represent them by the qualifier "all" before the first phrase.<br>
 <a name="fn1374" href="jer.htm#fnB1374"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:15)  This is an attempt to render the Hebrew particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> which is probably being used in the sense that BDB 473-74 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> 3.c, note. I.e., the causal connection is somewhat loose, related here to the prophecies against the nations. "So" seems to be the most appropriate way to represent this.<br>
 <a name="fn1375" href="jer.htm#fnB1375"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:15)  <i>Heb</i> "Thus said the LORD, the God of Israel, to me." It is generally understood that the communication is visionary. God does not have a "hand" and the action of going to the nations and making them drink of the cup are scarcely literal. The words are supplied in the translation to show the figurative nature of this passage.<br>
 <a name="fn1376" href="jer.htm#fnB1376"><sup>39</sup></a><b>sn</b> (25:15)  "Drinking from the cup of wrath" is a common figure to represent being punished by God. Isaiah had used it earlier to refer to the punishment which Judah was to suffer and from which God would deliver her (Isa 51:17, 22) and Jeremiah's contemporary Habakkuk uses it of Babylon "pouring out its wrath" on the nations and in turn being forced to drink the bitter cup herself (Hab 2:15-16). In Jer 51:7 the LORD will identify Babylon as the cup which makes the nations stagger. In v. 16 drinking from the cup will be identified with the sword (i.e., wars) that the LORD will send against the nations. Babylon is also to be identified as the sword (cf. Jer 51:20-23). What is being alluded to here in highly figurative language is the judgment that the LORD will wreak on the nations listed here through the Babylonians. The prophecy given here in symbolical form is thus an expansion of the one in vv. 9-11.<br>
 <a name="fn1377" href="jer.htm#fnB1377"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:16)  There is some debate about the meaning of the verb here. Both BDB (172 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vu^G&#180;</FONT> Hithpo) and KBL (191 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vu^G&#180;</FONT> Hitpol) interpret this of the back and forth movement of staggering. <i>HAL</i> 192 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vu^G&#180;</FONT> Hitpo) interprets it as vomiting. The word is used elsewhere of the up and down movement of the mountains (2 Sam 22:8) and the up and down movement of the rolling waves of the Nile (Jer 46:7, 8). The fact that a different verb is used in v. 27 for vomiting would appear to argue against it referring to vomiting (contra W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 1:674; it is "they" that do this not their stomachs).<br>
 <a name="fn1378" href="jer.htm#fnB1378"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:16)  <i>Heb</i> "because of the sword that I will send among them." Here, as often elsewhere in Jeremiah, the sword is figurative for warfare which brings death. See, e.g., 15:2. The causal particle here is found in verbal locutions where it is the cause of emotional states or action. Hence there are really two "agents" which produce the effects of "staggering" and "going out of their mind," the cup filled with God's wrath and the sword. The sword is the "more literal" and the actual agent by which the first agent's action is carried out.<br>

This phrase would obviously be more appropriate after all these things had happened as is the case in 44:6, 23 where the verbs referring to these conditions are past. Some see this phrase as a marginal gloss added after the tragedies of 597 B.C. or 586 B.C. However, it may refer here to the beginning stages where Judah has already suffered the loss of Josiah, of its freedom, of some of its temple treasures, and of some of its leaders (Dan 1:1-3. The different date for Jehoakim there is due to the different method of counting the king's first year; the third year there is the same as the fourth year in 25:1).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (25:30)  For the metaphor of the LORD going forth against his enemies like an attacking lion see Jer 49:19; 50:44; Isa 31:4 in all of which the LORD comes against the nations in defense of his people. In Hos 5:14 the metaphor is turned against his own people. The figure of a lion ravaging people has already been used in Jer 4:7 of the enemy from the north (Babylon).<br>
 <a name="fn1417" href="jer.htm#fnB1417"><sup>80</sup></a><b>sn</b> (25:30)  The word used here (<i>Heb</i> "his habitation") refers to the land of Canaan which the LORD chose to make his earthly dwelling (Exod 15:13) and which was the dwelling place of his chosen people (Jer 10:25; Isa 32:18). Judgment would begin at the "house of God" (v. 29; 1 Pet 4:17) but would extend to the rest of the earth (v. 29).<br>
 <a name="fn1418" href="jer.htm#fnB1418"><sup>81</sup></a><b>sn</b> (25:30)  The metaphor shifts from God as a lion to God as a mighty warrior (Jer 20:11; Isa 42:13; Zeph 3:17) shouting in triumph over his foes. Within the metaphor is a simile where the warrior is compared to a person stomping on grapes to remove the juice from them in the making of wine. The figure will be invoked later in a battle scene where the sounds of joy in the grape harvest are replaced by the sounds of joy of the enemy soldiers (Jer 48:33). The picture is drawn in more gory detail in Isa 63:1-6.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (25:31)  There is undoubtedly a deliberate allusion here to the reference to the "wars" (<i>Heb</i> "sword") that the LORD had said he would send raging through the nations (vv. 16, 27) and the "war" (<i>Heb</i> "sword") that he is proclaiming against them (v. 29).<br>

 <a name="fn1425" href="jer.htm#fnB1425"><sup>88</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:32)  The words "of military destruction" have been supplied in the translation to make the metaphor clear. The metaphor has shifted from that of God as a lion, to God as a warrior, to God as a judge, to God as the author of the storm winds of destruction. <br>
 <b>sn </b> (25:32) For the use of this word in a literal sense see Jonah 1:4. For its use to refer to the wrath of the LORD which will rage over the wicked see Jer 23:19; 30:23. Here it refers to the mighty Babylonian army which will come bringing destruction over all the known world. The same prophecy has just been given under the figure of the nations drinking the wine of God's wrath (vv. 15-29).<br>
 <a name="fn1426" href="jer.htm#fnB1426"><sup>89</sup></a><b>sn</b> (25:33)  The intent here is to emphasize the large quantity of those who are killed--there will be too many to insure proper mourning rites and proper burial.<br>
 <a name="fn1427" href="jer.htm#fnB1427"><sup>90</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:34)  <i>Heb</i> "Wail and cry out, you shepherds. Roll in the dust, you leaders of the flock." The terms have been reversed to explain the figure.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (25:34)  The term "shepherd" has been used several times in the book of Jeremiah to refer to the leaders of the people who were responsible for taking care of their people who are compared to a flock. (See Jer 23:1-4 and the notes there.) Here the figure has some irony involved in it. It is the shepherds who are to be slaughtered like sheep. They may have considered themselves "choice vessels" (the literal translation of "fine pottery"), but they would be slaughtered and lie scattered on the ground (v. 33) like broken pottery.<br>
 <a name="fn1428" href="jer.htm#fnB1428"><sup>91</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:34)  The meaning of this line is debated. The Greek version does not have the words "lie scattered" and it reads the words "like broken pieces of fine pottery" (<i>Heb</i> "like choice vessels"; <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hD&#180;m=j# yl!k=K!</FONT>) as "like choice rams" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hD&#180;m=j# yl@ya@K=</FONT>); i.e., "the days have been completed for you to be slaughtered and you will fall like choice rams." The reading of the Greek version fits the context better, but is probably secondary for that very reason. The word translated "lie scattered" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hx*opT=</FONT>) occurs nowhere else and the switch to the simile of "choice vessels" is rather abrupt. However, this section has been characterized by switching metaphors. The key to the interpretation and translation here is the consequential nature of the verbal actions involved. "Fall" does not merely refer to the action but the effect, i.e., "lie fallen" (cf. BDB 657 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lp^n&#180;</FONT> 7 and compare Judg 3:25; 1 Sam 31:8). Though the noun translated "lie scattered" does not occur elsewhere, the verb does. It is quite commonly used of dispersing people and that has led many to see that as the reference here. The word, however, can be used of scattering other things like seed (Isa 28:25), arrows (2 Sam 22:15; metaphorical for lightning), etc. Here it follows "slaughtered" and refers to their dead bodies. The simile (<i>Heb</i> " fallen like choice vessels") is elliptical, referring to "broken pieces" of choice vessels. In this sense the simile fits in perfectly with v. 33.<br>
 <a name="fn1429" href="jer.htm#fnB1429"><sup>92</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:35)  <i>Heb</i> "Flight [or, "place of escape"] will perish from the shepherds."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (25:35)  Judging from Gen 14:10 and Judg 8:12 (among many others), it was not uncommon for the leaders to try to save their own necks at the expense of their soldiers.<br>
 <a name="fn1430" href="jer.htm#fnB1430"><sup>93</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:36)  <i>Heb</i> "their pastures," i.e., the place where they "shepherd" their "flocks." The verb tenses in this section are not as clear as in the preceding. The participle in this verse is followed by a <i>vav</i> consecutive perfect like the imperatives in v. 34. The verbs in v. 38 are perfects but they can be and probably should be understood as prophetic like the perfect in v. 31 (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;n&#180;t*n+</FONT>) which is surrounded by imperfects, participles, and <i>vav</i> consecutive perfects.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (25:36)  Jer 25:36-38 shifts to the future as though the action were already accomplished or going on. It is the sound that Jeremiah hears in his "prophetic ears" of something that has begun (v. 29) but will find its culmination in the future (vv. 13, 16, 27, 30-35).<br>
 <a name="fn1431" href="jer.htm#fnB1431"><sup>94</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:37)  For this meaning of the verb used here see <i>HAL</i> 217 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;m^D&#180;</FONT> Nif. Elsewhere it refers to people dying (see, e.g., Jer 49:26; 50:30) hence some see a reference to "lifeless."<br>

 <b>sn</b> (25:38)  The text returns to the metaphor alluded to in v. 30. The bracketing of speeches with repeated words or motifs is a common rhetorical device in ancient literature.<br>
 <a name="fn1434" href="jer.htm#fnB1434"><sup>97</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:38)  This is a way of rendering the Hebrew particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> which is probably here for emphasis rather than indicating cause (see BDB 473 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> 1.e and compare usage in Jer 22:22).<br>
 <a name="fn1435" href="jer.htm#fnB1435"><sup>98</sup></a><b>tc</b> (25:38)  <i>Heb</i> "by the sword of the oppressors." The reading here follows a number of Hebrew MSS and the Greek version. The majority of Hebrew MSS read "the anger of the oppressor." The reading "the sword of the oppressors" is supported also by the parallel use of this phrase in Jer 46:16; 50:16. The error in the Masoretic text may be explained by confusion with the following line which has the same beginning combination (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/orj&amp; yn}P=m!</FONT> confused for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">br\j# yn}P=m!</FONT>). This reading is also supported by the Targum, the Aramaic paraphrase of the OT. According to BDB 413 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hn&#180;y&#180;</FONT> Qal the feminine singular participle (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hn&#180;oYh^</FONT>) is functioning as a collective in this idiom (see GKC &#167;122.<i>s</i> for this phenomenon).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (25:38)  The connection between "war" (<i>Heb</i> "the sword") and the wrath or anger of the LORD has already been made in vv. 16, 27 and the sword has been referred to also in vv. 29, 31. The sword is of course a reference to the onslaughts of the Babylonian armies (see later Jer 51:20-23).<br>
 <a name="fn1436" href="jer.htm#fnB1436"><sup>99</sup></a><b>sn</b> (25:38)  Beginning with Jer 26 up to Jer 45 the book narrates in third person style incidents in the life of Jeremiah and prophecies (or sermons) he gave in obedience to the LORD's commands. Baruch is the probable narrator, passing on information gleaned from Jeremiah himself. (See Jer 36:4, 18, 32; 45:1 and also 32:13-14 where it is clear that Baruch is Jeremiah's scribe or secretary.) Chapters 26-29 contain narratives concerning reactions to Jeremiah's prophecies and his conflict with the prophets who were prophesying that things would be all right (see, e.g., 14:14-15; 23:21).<br>
 <a name="fn1437" href="jer.htm#fnB1437"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:1)  The words "to Jeremiah" are not in the Hebrew text. They are added by the Old Latin (not the Vulgate) and the Syriac translations. They are implicit, however, to the narrative style which speaks of Jeremiah in the third person (cf. vv. 7, 12). They have been supplied in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn1438" href="jer.htm#fnB1438"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:1)  It is often thought that the term here is equivalent to a technical term in Akkadian (<i>reshsharruti</i>) which refers to the part of the year remaining from the death or deposing of the previous king until the beginning of the calendar year when the new king officially ascended the throne. In this case it would refer to the part of the year between September, 609 B.C. when Jehoiakim was placed on the throne as a puppet king by Pharaoh Necho (2 Kgs 23:34-35) and April, 608 B.C. when he would have been officially celebrated as king. However, it will be suggested below in conjunction with the textual problems in 27:1 and 28:1 that the term does not necessarily refer to this period.<br>
 <a name="fn1439" href="jer.htm#fnB1439"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (26:2)  It is generally agreed that the incident recorded in this chapter relates to the temple message that Jeremiah gave in 7:1-15.

 <a name="fn1442" href="jer.htm#fnB1442"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:3)  <i>Heb</i> "because of the wickedness of their deeds."<br>
 <a name="fn1443" href="jer.htm#fnB1443"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:4)  <i>Heb</i> "thus says the LORD, `...'." The use of the indirect quotation in the translation eliminates one level of embedded quotation to avoid confusion.<br>
 <a name="fn1444" href="jer.htm#fnB1444"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:4)  <i>Heb</i> "by walking in my law which I set before you."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (26:4)  Examples of those laws are found in Jer 7:5-6, 9. The law was summarized or epitomized in the ten commandments which are called the "words of the covenant" in Exod 34:28, but it contained much more. However, when Israel is taken to task by God, it often relates to their failure to live up to the standards of the ten commandments (<i>Heb</i> "the ten words"; see Hos 4:1-3; Jer 7:9).<br>
 <a name="fn1445" href="jer.htm#fnB1445"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:5)  See the translator's note on 7:13 for the idiom here.<br>
 <a name="fn1446" href="jer.htm#fnB1446"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:6)  26:4-6 are all one long sentence containing a long condition with subordinate clauses (vv. 4-5) and a compound consequence in v. 6: <i>Heb</i> "If you will not obey me by walking in my law...by paying heed to the words of the prophets which...and you did not pay heed, then I will make...and I will make..." The sentence has been broken down in conformity to contemporary English style but an attempt has been made to reflect all the subordinations in the English translation.<br>
 <a name="fn1447" href="jer.htm#fnB1447"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (26:6)  See the study note on Jer 7:13.<br>
 <a name="fn1448" href="jer.htm#fnB1448"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:8)  The translation again represents an attempt to break up a long complex Hebrew sentence into equivalent English ones that conform more to contemporary English style: <i>Heb</i> "And as soon as Jeremiah finished saying all that...the priests...grabbed him and said..." The word "some" has been supplied in the translation, because obviously it was not all the priests, the prophets, and all the people, but only some of them. There is, of course, rhetorical intent here to show that all were implicated, although all may not have actually participated. (This is a common figure called synecdoche where all is put for a part-- all for all kinds or representatives of all kinds. See Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, pp. 614-19 and compare usage in Acts 10:12; Matt 3:5.)<br>
 <a name="fn1449" href="jer.htm#fnB1449"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:8)  Or "You must certainly die!" The construction here is again emphatic with the infinitive preceding the finite verb (cf.

It is clear from the context here and in 7:1-15 that the emphasis is on "in the LORD's name" and that the question is rhetorical. The question is not a quest for information but an accusation, a remonstrance. (For this figure see Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, pp. 953-54 who calls a question like this a rhetorical question of remonstrance or expostulation. For good examples see Pss 11:1; 50:16.) For the significance of "prophesying in the LORD's name" see the study note on 14:14. The translation again utilizes the indirect quote to eliminate one level of embedded quotation.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (26:9)  They are questioning his right to claim the LORD's authority for what they see as a false prophecy. They believed that the presence of the LORD in the temple guaranteed their safety (7:4, 10, 14) and that the LORD could not possibly be threatening its destruction. Hence they were ready to put him to death as a false prophet according to the law of Moses (Deut 18:20).<br>
 <a name="fn1451" href="jer.htm#fnB1451"><sup>15</sup></a><b>sn</b> (26:10)  These <i>officials of Judah</i> were officials from the royal court.

 <a name="fn1454" href="jer.htm#fnB1454"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:10)  The translation follows many Hebrew MSS and ancient versions in reading the word "house" (= temple) here.

 <b>sn</b> (26:10)  The location of the <i>New Gate</i> is uncertain. It is mentioned again in Jer 36:10 where it is connected with the upper (i.e., inner) court of the temple. Some equate it with the Upper Gate that Jotham rebuilt during his reign (2 Kgs 15:35; Jotham reigned from 750-735 B.C.). That gate, however, has already been referred to as the Upper Gate of Benjamin in Jer 20:2 (for more detail see the study note there) and would not likely have been called something different here.<br>

Jeremiah (and the LORD) charged that the opposite was the case (cf. 14:14-15; 23:21).

They were very influential in both the judicial, political, and religious proceedings of the cities and the state. (See, e.g., Josh 24:1; 2 Sam 19:11; 2 Kgs 23:1 for elders of Israel/Judah, and Deut 21:1-9; Ruth 4:1-2 for elders of the cities.)<br>

Hezekiah was a godly king, noted for his religious reforms and for his faith in the LORD in the face of the Assyrian threat (2 Kgs 18-19; 2 Chr 32:1-23). The deliverance of Jerusalem in response to his prayers of faith (2 Kgs 19:14-19, 29-36) was undoubtedly well-known to the people of Jerusalem and Judah and may have been one of the prime reasons for their misplaced trust in the inviolability of Zion/Jerusalem (see Ps 46, 76) though the people of Micah's day already believed it too (Mic 3:11).<br>

This was a "lynch mob" instigated by the priests and false prophets which was stymied by the royal officials supported by some of the elders of Judah. Since it is disjunctive or parenthetical it is unclear whether this incident happened before or after that in the main narrative being reported.<br>

He was also the father of Gedaliah who became governor of Judah after the fall of Jerusalem (Jer 40:5). The particle at the beginning of the verse is meant to contrast the actions of this man with the actions of Jehoiakim. The impression created by this verse is that it took more than just the royal officials' opinion and the elders' warnings to keep the priests and prophets from swaying popular opinion to put Jeremiah to death.<br>
 <a name="fn1486" href="jer.htm#fnB1486"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:24)  <i>Heb</i> "Nevertheless, the hand of Ahikam son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah so that he would not be given (even more literally, `so as not to give him') into the hand of the people to kill him."

 <a name="fn1487" href="jer.htm#fnB1487"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (27:1)  The names of Jeremiah and of Nebuchadnezzar are spelled differently in the Hebrew of chapter 27-29. That and other literary features show that these three chapters are all closely related. The events of these three chapters all take place within the space of one year (cf. 28:1; 29:17).<br>
 <a name="fn1488" href="jer.htm#fnB1488"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tc</b> (27:1)  The reading here is based on a few Hebrew MSS and the Syriac and Arabic versions. The majority of Hebrew MSS and most of the versions read "At the beginning of the reign of Josiah's son, Jehoiakim king of Judah" as in 26:1. The LXX does not have this whole verse. It has long been recognized that the text of 27:1 is textually corrupt. The date formula in the majority of Hebrew MSS at 27:1 is contradictory both with the context of the passage which deals with an event in the reign of Zedekiah (see vv. 3, 13 and v. 20 which presupposes that Jeconiah, Jehoiakim's son, has been taken captive [i.e., after the death of Jehoaikim!]) and the date formula in 28:1 which refers to an event "in that same year" and then qualifies it with "Early in the reign of Zedekiah." Hence it is preferable to read "Zedekiah" here in place of "Jehoiakim" and explain the error in the Hebrew manuscripts as an erroneous copying of 26:1.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (27:1)  If the text of 28:1 is correct, the date here would be sometime in the fourth year of Zedekiah which would be 594/3 B.C. Zedekiah had been placed on the throne as a puppet king by Nebuchadnezzar after he deposed Zedekiah's nephew, Jeconiah (Jehoiachin) and sent him, his family, some of the temple treasures, and some of the Judean leaders away to Babylon (2 Kgs 23:8-17). The author does not state directly why the envoys from the nations mentioned in v. 3 were in Jerusalem, but the implication is that they were there trying to interest Zedekiah in rebelling. Modern scholars have used the data here and in 28:1 and in the Babylonian Chronicles (it contains a record of major events of Nebuchadnezzar's reign) to suggest a plausible background for such a meeting. Nebuchadnezzar had to put down an uprising in the east and quell a rebellion in Babylon itself in the two years prior to this meeting. Some "prophets" in the nation of Israel and in these other nations (see vv. 9-10) saw in these events hopes for not having to pay tribute to (i.e., submit to the yoke of) Nebuchadnezzar and were counseling rebellion. Jeremiah saw this as foolhardy and counseled otherwise. Again, there is a conflict between "prophets" which is what this whole section (Jer 27-29) is all about.<br>
 <a name="fn1489" href="jer.htm#fnB1489"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (27:2)  There is some disjunction in the narrative of this chapter. The introduction in v. 1 presents this as a third person narrative. But the rest of the passage reports the narrative in first person. Thus the text reads here "Thus the LORD said to me..." In vv. 12, 16 the narrative picks up in first person report and never indicates that Jeremiah carried out the command in vv. 2-4 that introduces the message which he repeats in summary form himself to Zedekiah. The report is thus an "unedited" first person report. This may create some confusion for some readers, but it is best to leave it in first person here because of the continuation in vv. 12, 16.<br>
 <a name="fn1490" href="jer.htm#fnB1490"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (27:2)  The <i>yoke</i> is a common biblical symbol of political servitude (see, e.g., Deut 28:48; 1 Kgs 12:4, 9, 10). From the context of 1 Kgs 12 it is clear that it applied to taxation and the provision of conscript labor. In international political contexts it involved the payment of heavy tribute which was often conscripted from the citizens (see, e.g., 2 Kgs 15:19-20; 23:34-35) and the furnishing of military contingents for the sovereign's armies (see, e.g., 2 Kgs 24:2). Jeremiah's message here combines both a symbolic action (the wearing of a yoke) and words of explanation as in Jer 19:1-13. (See Isa 20:1-6 for an example outside of Jeremiah.) The casting off of the yoke has been used earlier in Jer 2:20, 5:5 to refer to Israel's failure to remain spiritually "subject" or faithful to God.<br>
 <a name="fn1491" href="jer.htm#fnB1491"><sup>5</sup></a><b>sn</b> (27:3)  The nations of <i>Edom</i>, <i>Moab</i>, and<i> Ammon</i> were east of Judah. They were sometimes allies and sometimes enemies. The nations of <i>Tyre </i>and<i> Sidon</i> were on the sea coast north and west of Judah. They are best known for their maritime trade during the reign of Solomon. They were more commonly allies of Israel and Judah than enemies.<br>
 <a name="fn1492" href="jer.htm#fnB1492"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (27:3)  <i>Heb</i> "send by means of them" [i.e., the straps and crossbars made into a yoke] to...through." The text is broken up in conformity with contemporary English style. Many translations ignore the suffix on the end of "send" and find some support for this on the basis of its absence in the Lucianic Greek text. However, it is probably functioning metonymically here for the message which they see symbolized before them and is now explained clearly to them.<br>
 <a name="fn1493" href="jer.htm#fnB1493"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (27:4)  <i>Heb</i> "Yahweh of armies, the God of Israel."<br>

 <b>sn</b> (27:6)  This statement is rhetorical, emphasizing the totality of Nebuchadnezzar's dominion. Neither here nor in Dan 2:38 is it to be understood literally.<br>
 <a name="fn1500" href="jer.htm#fnB1500"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (27:7)  This is a figure that emphasizes that they will serve for a long time but not for an unlimited duration. The kingdom of Babylon lasted a relatively short time by ancient standards. It lasted from 605 B.C. when Nebuchadnezzar defeated Necho at Carchemish until the fall of Babylon in 538 B.C. There were only four rulers. Nebuchadnezzar was succeeded by his son, Evil Merodach (cf. 52:31), and two other rulers who were not descended from him.<br>
 <a name="fn1501" href="jer.htm#fnB1501"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (27:7)  <i>Heb</i> "until the time of his land, even his, comes." The independent pronoun is placed here for emphasis on the possessive pronoun.

The long complex Hebrew sentence has been broken up in conformity with contemporary English style and the figures interpreted for the sake of clarity. The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta@</FONT>, the sign of the accusative, before "which will not put..." is a little unusual here.

 <a name="fn1507" href="jer.htm#fnB1507"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tc</b> (27:8)  The verb translated "destroy" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;m^T*</FONT>) is usually intransitive in the stem of the verb used here. It is found in a transitive sense elsewhere only in Ps 64:7. BDB 1070 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;m^T*</FONT> 7 emends both texts. In this case they recommend <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yT!T!</FONT>, "until I give them into his hand." That reading is suggested by the texts of the Syriac and Targumic translations (see <i>BHS</i> fn c). The Greek translation supports reading the verb "destroy" but treats it as though it were intransitive "until they are destroyed by his hand" (reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;M*T%</FONT>?). The Masoretic text here is accepted as the more difficult reading and support is seen in the transitive use of the verb in Ps 64:7.<br>
 <b>tn</b> (27:8)  <i>Heb</i> "I will punish that nation until I have destroyed them [i.e., its people] by his hand." "Hand" here refers to agency. Hence, "I will use him."<br>
 <a name="fn1508" href="jer.htm#fnB1508"><sup>22</sup></a><b>sn</b> (27:9)  Various means of <i>divination</i> are alluded to in the OT. For example, Ezek 21:26-27 alludes to throwing down arrows to see which way they fall and consulting the shape of the liver of slaughtered animals. Gen 44:5 alludes to reading the future through pouring liquid in a cup. The means alluded to in this verse were all classified as pagan and prohibited as illegitimate in Deut 18:10-14. The LORD had promised that he would speak to them through prophets like Moses (Deut 18:15, 18). But even prophets could lie. Hence, the LORD told them that the test of a true prophet was whether what he said came true or not (Deut 18:20-22). An example of false prophesying and the vindication of the true as opposed to the false will be given in the chapter that follows this.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (27:19)  The <i>bronze stands</i> are the movable bronze stands described in 1 Kgs 7:27-37. They were the stands for the bronze basins described in 1 Kgs 7:38-39. According to 2 Chr 4:6 the latter were used to wash the burnt offerings. The priests would have been very concerned especially about the big bronze basin and the movable stands and their basins because they involved their ritual purification apart from which they would have had no sanctity. These articles (or furnishings in this case) were broken up and the bronze carried away to Babylon along with all the other bronze, silver, and gold furnishings when the temple and the city were destroyed in 587 B.C. (see 2 Kgs 25:13-15; Jer 52:17-19).<br>

Some of the sentences still violate contemporary English style (e.g., v. 20) but breaking them down any further would lose the focus. For further discussion see the study note on v. 21.<br>
 <a name="fn1540" href="jer.htm#fnB1540"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (27:21)  <i>Heb</i> "Yahweh of armies, the God of Israel." For the significance of this title see the note at 2:19.<br>
 <a name="fn1541" href="jer.htm#fnB1541"><sup>55</sup></a><b>sn</b> (27:21)  Some of the flavor of the repetitive nature of Hebrew narrative is apparent in vv. 19-21. In the Hebrew original vv. 19-20 are all one long sentence with complex coordination and subordinations. I.e., all the objects in v. 19 are all objects of the one verb "has spoken about" and the description in v. 20 is one long relative or descriptive clause. The introductory "For the LORD...has already spoken" is repeated in v. 21 from v. 19 and reference is made to the same articles once again, only in the terms that were used in v. 18b. By this means, attention is focused for these people (here the priests and the people) on articles which were of personal concern for them and the climax or the punch line is delayed to the end. The point being made is that the false prophets are mistaken; not only will the articles taken to Babylon not be returned "very soon" but the LORD had said that the ones that remained would be taken there as well. They ought rather pray that the LORD will change his mind and not carry them off as well.<br>
 <a name="fn1542" href="jer.htm#fnB1542"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (27:22)  This verb is a little difficult to render here. The word is used in the sense of taking note of something and acting according to what is noticed. It is the word that has been translated several times throughout Jeremiah as "punish [someone]." It is also used in the opposite of sense of taking note and "show consideration for" (or "care for;" see, e.g., Ruth 1:6). Here the nuance is positive and is further clarified by the actions that follow, bringing them back and restoring them.<br>
 <a name="fn1543" href="jer.htm#fnB1543"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn</b> (27:22)  <i>Heb</i> "oracle of the LORD."<br>
 <a name="fn1544" href="jer.htm#fnB1544"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tc</b> (28:1)  The original text is unusually full here and deemed by many scholars to be corrupt: <i>Heb</i> "And it happened in that year in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month Hananiah...said to..." Many scholars see a contradiction between "in the fourth year" and "in the beginning of the reign." These scholars point to the fact that the Greek version does not have "in that year" and "in the beginning of the reign of"; it merely reads "in the fourth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fifth month." These scholars generally also regard the heading at 27:1 to be unoriginal and interpret the heading in the Masoretic text here as a faulty harmonization of the original (that in the Greek version) with the erroneous one in the Hebrew of 27:1. However, it is just as possible that the Greek version in both places is an attempt to harmonize the data of 27:1 and 28:1. I.e., it left out both the heading at 27:1, and "in that year" and "at the beginning of the reign of" in the heading here because it thought the data was contradictory. However, it is just as likely that there is really no contradiction here. I.e., the term "beginning of the reign" can include the fourth year. Eugene Merrill in an article in JANES 19 (1989) has argued that the term here refers not to the accession year (see the translator's note on 26:1) but to the early years in general (see "The `Accession Year' and Davidic Chronology," JANES 19 (1989):105-6 and cf. fn18 for bibliography on Akkadian parallels). Hence the phrase has been translated both here and in 27:1 "early in the reign of..." For other attempts at harmonization see the discussion in Keown, Scalise, Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i>,<i> </i>p. 41, note 1a.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (28:1)  The dating here is very full and precise. "In that same year" ties the events here in with the messages that Jeremiah delivered to the envoys, the king and his court, and the priests and people while wearing the yoke symbolizing servitude to Nebuchadnezzar. The text wants to show that the events here transpired shortly after those in Jer 27 and that Jeremiah is still wearing the yoke. The supplying of the precise month is important because the end of the chapter will show that Jeremiah's prophecy regarding Hananiah was fulfilled two months later. Hence Jeremiah is the true prophet and Hananiah and the others (27:16) are false. The supplying of the year is perhaps significant because the author states in 51:59 that Zedekiah went to Babylon that same year, probably to pledge his loyalty. The suggestion lies ready to hand that the events of this chapter and the preceding one lead to his dismissal of the false prophet Hananiah's advice and the acceptance of Jeremiah's.<br>
 <a name="fn1545" href="jer.htm#fnB1545"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:1)  Literally "to me." The rest of the chapter is all in third person narrative (see vv. 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 15). Hence, many explain the first person here as a misunderstanding of the abbreviation "to Jeremiah" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hY&#180;m!r+y] la#</FONT> = <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yl^a@</FONT>). It is just as likely that there is a similar kind of disjunction here that was found in 27:1-2 only in the opposite direction. There what started out as a third person report was really a first person report. Here what starts out as a first person report is really a third person report. The text betrays both the hands of the narrator, probably Baruch, and the reportee, Jeremiah, who dictated a synopsis of his messages and his stories to Baruch to write down (Jer 36:4, 32).<br>

 <a name="fn1549" href="jer.htm#fnB1549"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (28:2)  See the study note on 27:2 for this figure. Hananiah is given the same title "the prophet" as Jeremiah throughout the chapter and claims to speak with the same authority (compare v. 2a with 27:21a). He even speaks like the true prophet; the verb form "I will break" is in the "prophetic perfect" emphasizing certitude. His message here is a contradiction of Jeremiah's message recorded in the preceding chapter (compare especially v. 3 with 27:16, 19-22 and v. 4 with 22:24-28). The people and the priests are thus confronted with a choice of whom to believe. Who is the "true" prophet and who is the "false" one? Only fulfillment of their prophecies will prove which is which (see Deut 18:21-22).<br>

 <a name="fn1553" href="jer.htm#fnB1553"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tc</b> (28:8)  Many Hebrew MSS read "starvation/famine" which is the second member of a common triad "sword, famine, and plague" in Jeremiah. This triad occurs thirteen times in the book and undoubtedly influenced a later scribe to read "starvation [= famine]" here. For this triad see the note on 14:14. The words "disaster and plagues" are missing in the LXX.<br>
 <a name="fn1554" href="jer.htm#fnB1554"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:9)  The verbs in this verse are to be interpreted as iterative imperfects in past time rather than as futures because of the explicit contrast that is drawn in the two verses by the emphatic syntactical construction of the two verses. Both verses begin with a <i>casus pendens</i> construction to throw the two verses into contrast: <i>Heb</i> "<i>The prophets</i> who were before me and you from ancient times, <i>they</i> prophesied...<i>The prophet</i> who prophesied peace, when the word of <i>that prophet</i> came true, <i>that prophet</i> was known that the LORD truly sent <i>him</i>."<br>

 <b>sn</b> (28:13)  This whole incident (and the preceding one in Jer 28) is symbolic. Jeremiah's wearing of the yoke was symbolic of the LORD's message to submit to Babylonian authority. Hananiah's breaking of the yoke was a prediction that that authority would not last beyond two years. By breaking the yoke he was encouraging rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar's (and hence the LORD's) authority (cf. 27:9, 14). However, rebelling would only result in further, harsher, more irresistible measures by Nebuchadnezzar to control such rebellion.<br>

 <a name="fn1565" href="jer.htm#fnB1565"><sup>22</sup></a><b>sn</b> (28:16)  In giving people false assurances of restoration when the LORD had already told them to submit to Babylon, Hananiah was really counseling rebellion against the LORD.

 <a name="fn1566" href="jer.htm#fnB1566"><sup>23</sup></a><b>sn</b> (28:17)  Comparison with Jer 28:1 shows that this whole incident took place in the space of two months. Hananiah had prophesied that the captivity would be over before two years had past. However, before two months were past, Hananiah himself died in fulfillment of Jeremiah's prophecy of his death. His death was a validation of Jeremiah as a true prophet. The subsequent events of 588 B.C. would validate Jeremiah's prophesies and invalidate those of Hananiah.<br>

It is clear, however, in Gen 39:1 that "eunuchs" could be married. On the other hand it is clear from Isa 59:3-5 that some who bore this title could not have children. In this period, it is possible that the persons who bore this title were high officials like the <i>rab saris </i>who was a high official in the Babylonian court (cf. Jer 39:3, 13; 52:25).

He may, however, have been a son or grandson of the High Priest who discovered the book of the law during the reign of Josiah (cf., e.g., 2 Kgs 22:8, 10) which was so instrumental in Josiah's reforms. <br>
 <a name="fn1572" href="jer.htm#fnB1572"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (29:3)  It is unclear whether this incident preceded or followed those in the preceding chapter. It is known from 52:59 that Zedekiah himself had made a trip to Babylon in the same year mentioned in 28:1 and that Jeremiah had used that occasion to address a prophecy of disaster to Babylon. It is not impossible that Jeremiah sent two such disparate messages at the same time (see Jer 25:8-11, 12-14, 17-18, 26).<br>

However, the word is singular and not likely to cover both actions that follow. The word is also used of the greedy act of Achan (Josh 7:15) which threatened Israel with destruction and the churlish behavior of Nabal (1 Sam 25:25) which threatened him and his household with destruction. The word is also used of foolish talk in Isa 9:17 (9:16 HT) and Isa 32:6. It is possible that this refers to a separate act, one that would have brought the death penalty from Nebuchadnezzar, i.e., the preaching of rebellion in conformity with the message of the false prophets in Jerusalem and other nations (cf. 27:9, 13). Hence it is possible that the translation should read: "This will happen because of their vile conduct. They have propagated rebellion. They have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives.

 <a name="fn1615" href="jer.htm#fnB1615"><sup>49</sup></a><b>sn</b> (29:25)  Jer 29:24-32 are concerned with Jeremiah's interaction with a false prophet named Shemaiah. The narrative in this section is not in strict chronological order and is somewhat elliptical. It begins with a report of a message that Jeremiah appears to have delivered directly to Shemaiah and refers to a letter that Shemaiah sent to the priest Zephaniah encouraging him to reprimand Jeremiah for what Shemaiah considered treasonous words in his letter to the exiles (vv. 24-28; compare v. 28 with v. 5). However, Jeremiah is in Jerusalem and Shemaiah is in Babylon. The address must then be part of a second letter Jeremiah sent to Babylon. Following this the narrative refers to Zephaniah reading Shemaiah's letter to Jeremiah and Jeremiah sending a further letter to the captives in Babylon (vv. 29-32). This is probably not a third letter but part of the same letter in which Jeremiah reprimands Shemaiah for sending his letter to Zephaniah (vv. 25-28; the same letter referred to in v. 29). The order of events thus is: Jeremiah sent a letter to the captives counseling them to settle down in Babylon (vv. 1-23). Shemaiah sent a letter to Zephaniah asking him to reprimand Jeremiah (vv. 26-28). After Zephaniah read that letter to Jeremiah (v. 29), Jeremiah wrote a further letter to Babylon reprimanding him (vv. 25-28, 31) and pronouncing judgment on him (v. 32). The elliptical nature of the narrative is reflected in the fact that vv. 25-27 are part of a long causal sentence which sets forth an accusation but has no corresponding main clause or announcement of judgment. This kind of construction involves a rhetorical figure (called aposiopesis) where what is begun is not finished for various rhetorical reasons. Here the sentence that is broken off is part of an announcement of judgment which is not picked up until v. 32 after a further (though related) accusation (v. 31b).<br>

The words that the LORD is about to speak follow in chs. 30-31.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (30:2)  Reference is made here to the so-called "Book of Consolation" which is the most extended treatment of the theme of hope or deliverance in the book. Jeremiah was called to be a prophet both of judgment (of tearing down and destroying) and of deliverance (of replanting and rebuilding; see Jer 1:10). Jeremiah lamented that he had to predominantly pronounce judgment but he has periodically woven in prophecies of hope after judgment in 3:14-18; 16:14-15; 23:3-8; 24:4-7; 29:10-14, 32. The oracles of hope contained in these chapters are undated but reference is made in them to the restoration of both Israel which had gone into exile in Assyria in 722 B.C. and Judah which began to be exiled in 605 and 597 B.C. Jeremiah had already written as early as the reign of Zedekiah about the exiles who were the good figs who were to experience the "good" of restoration (24:4-7; 29:10-14) and had spoken of the further exile of those who remained in Judah. So it is possible that these oracles fit in roughly the same time frame as chapters 27-29. <br>

The prophets of both the eighth and seventh century looked forward to this ideal (see, e.g., Hos 1:11 (2:2 HT); Isa 11:11-13; Jer 23:5-6; 30:3; 33:7; Ezek 37:15-22).

 <b>sn</b> (30:7)  The reference to <i>a terrible time of trouble</i> (<i>Heb</i> "that day") is a common shorthand reference in the prophets to "the Day of the LORD." The "Day of the LORD" refers to a time when God intervenes in judgment against the wicked. The time referent can be either near or far, referring to something as near as the Assyrian threat in the time of Ahaz (Isa 7:18, 20, 21, 23) or as distant as the eschatological battle of God against Gog when he attacks Israel (Ezek 38:14, 18). The judgment can be against Israel's enemies and result in Israel's deliverance (Jer 50:30-34). At other times as here the Day of the LORD involves judgment on Israel itself. Here reference is to the judgment that the northern kingdom, Israel, has already experienced (cf., e.g., Jer 3:8) and which the southern kingdom, Judah, is in the process of experiencing and which Jeremiah has lamented over several times and even described in hyperbolic and apocalyptic terms in Jer 4:19-31.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (30:7)  <i>Jacob</i> here is figurative for the people descended from him. Moreover the figure moves from Jacob = descendants of Jacob to only a part of those descendants. Not all of his descendants who have experienced and are now experiencing trouble will be saved. Only a remnant (i.e., the good figs, cf., e.g., Jer 23:3; 31:7) will see the good things that the LORD has in store for them (Jer 24:5-6). The bad figs will suffer destruction through war, starvation, and disease (cf., e.g., Jer 24:8-10 among many other references).<br>

The shift from third person at the end of v. 7 to second person in v. 8c, d and back to third person in v. 8e is typical of Hebrew poetry in the book of Psalms and in the prophetic books (cf., GKC &#167;114.<i>p</i> and compare usage in Deut 32:15; Isa 5:8 listed there). The present translation, like several other modern ones, has typically leveled them to the same person to avoid confusion for modern readers who are not accustomed to this poetic tradition.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (30:8)  In the immediate context the reference to <i>the yoke of their servitude to foreign domination</i> (<i>Heb</i> "his yoke") should be understood as a reference to the yoke of servitude to Nebuchadnezzar which has been referred to often in Jer 27-28 (see, e.g., 27:8, 12; 28:2, 4, 11). The end of that servitude has already been referred to in 25:11-14; 29:11-14. Like many other passages in the OT it has been given a later eschatological reinterpretation in the light of subsequent bondages and lack of complete fulfillment, i.e., of restoration to the land and restoration of the Davidic monarchy.<br>

He is called "David" because he is from the Davidic line and because David is the type of the ideal king whom the prophets looked forward to.

Zion's sins are beyond defense and the wounds inflicted upon her beyond healing. However, God, himself, in his own time will forgive her sins (Jer 31:34; 33:8) and heal her wounds (Jer 30:17).<br>
 <a name="fn1660" href="jer.htm#fnB1660"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:14)  <i>Heb</i> "attacked you like...with the chastening of a cruel one because of the greatness of your iniquity [and because] your sins are many."

 <a name="fn1661" href="jer.htm#fnB1661"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:16)  For the translation of this particle, which is normally translated "therefore" and often introduces an announcement of judgment, compare the usage at Jer 16:14 and the translator's note there. Here as there it introduces a contrast, a rather unexpected announcement of salvation. For a similar use see also Hos 2:14 (2:16 HT). Recognition of this usage makes the proposed emendation of <i>BHS</i> of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lK* /k@l*</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lk*w+</FONT> unnecessary.<br>
 <a name="fn1662" href="jer.htm#fnB1662"><sup>32</sup></a><b>sn</b> (30:16)  With the exception of the second line there is a definite attempt at wordplay in each line to underline the principle of <i>lex talionis</i> on a national and political level.

For the meaning of the idiom "restore the fortunes of" see the translator's note on 29:14. The "tents of Jacob" refers to their homes or houses (see BDB 14 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lh#a)</FONT> 2 and compare usage in Judg 19:9; Mal 2:12). The word "ruined" has been supplied in the translation to show more clearly the idea of restoration of their houses on their former sites in conformity to the concepts in the latter half of the verse.<br>
 <a name="fn1666" href="jer.htm#fnB1666"><sup>36</sup></a><b>sn</b> (30:18)  <i>Heb</i> "on its tel." A tel is a site where successive layers of occupation are built upon one another after the destruction or decay of the former city. The original site was not abandoned because it had been chosen for strategic purposes, such as proximity to water or ease of defense. Many modern archaeological sites have the designation "Tel" as a component of their name because of this practice.<br>

"His children" refers to "Jacob" who has been referred to in v. 18 in the phrase "I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob." "His children" are thus the restored exiles. Some commentaries see the reference here to the restoration of numbers in accordance with the previous verse. However, the last line of this verse and the reference to the ruler in the following verse suggests rather restoration of the religious and political institutions to their former state. For the use of the word translated "community" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hd&#180;u@</FONT>) to refer to a political congregation as well as its normal use to refer to a religious one see 1 Kgs 12:20. For the idea of "in my favor" (i.e., under the eye and regard of) for the Hebrew phrase used here (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn~p*l=</FONT>) see BDB 817 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hn\P*</FONT> II.4.a(b).<br>
 <a name="fn1670" href="jer.htm#fnB1670"><sup>40</sup></a><b>sn</b> (30:21)  The statement <i>their ruler will come from their own number</i> accords with the regulation in Deut 17:15.

 <a name="fn1671" href="jer.htm#fnB1671"><sup>41</sup></a><b>sn</b> (30:21)  Ordinarily this prerogative was confined to the priests and the Levites and even then under strict regulations (cf., e.g., Num 8:19; 16:10; Lev 16:10; 21:17; 22:3). Uzziah king of Judah violated this and suffered leprosy for having done so (2 Chr 26:16-20). It is clear, however, that both David and Solomon on occasion exercised priestly functions in the presence of the ark or the altar which it was normally lawful for only the priests to approach (cf., e.g., 2 Sam 6:13-14; 1 Kgs 8:22, 54-55). Here reference is probably not to the normal prerogatives of offering sacrifice or burning incense but access to God's special presence at special times for the purpose of consultation.<br>

The question is a rhetorical one expecting the answer "no one" and is a way of expressing an emphatic negative (see BDB 566 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ym!</FONT> f[c]). The concept of "pledging" something refers to putting up security in guarantee of payment. Here the word is used figuratively of "putting up one's heart [i.e., his very being (cf. BDB 524 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bl@</FONT> 7 and Ps 22:26)]" for the privilege of access to God. The rhetorical question denies that any one would do that if he were not bidden by God to do so.<br>

Jer 7:3; 11:4). It is a formula referring to a covenant relationship in which God pledges to protect, provide, and be present with his people and they in turn promise to be loyal and obedient to him (see Deut 26:17-18; 29:10-13).<br>
 <a name="fn1675" href="jer.htm#fnB1675"><sup>45</sup></a><b>sn</b> (30:24)  Jer 30:23-24 are almost a verbatim repetition of 23:19-20. There the verses were addressed to the people of Jerusalem as a warning that the false prophets had no intimate awareness of the LORD's plans which were plans of destruction for wicked Israel not plans of peace and prosperity. Here they function as further assurance that the LORD will judge the wicked nations oppressing them when he reverses their fortunes and restores them once again to the land as his special people (cf. vv. 18-22).<br>
 <a name="fn1676" href="jer.htm#fnB1676"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (31:1)  This verse repeats v. 22 but with specific reference to <i>all the family groups of Israel</i>, i.e., to all Israel and Judah. It functions here as a transition to the next section which will deal with the restoration of Israel (31:3-20) and Judah (31:21-25) and their reunification in the land (31:27-29) under a new covenant relation with God (31:31-37).

 <b>sn</b> (31:2)  This refers to the remnant of northern Israel who had not been killed when Assyria conquered Israel in 722 B.C. or who had not died in exile. References to Samaria in v. 5 and to Ephraim in vv. 6, 9 make clear that northern Israel is in view here.<br>

At that time long ago the LORD manifested himself to them. He said, `I have...That is why I have drawn you to myself through my unfailing kindness.'" For the basis for each of these translations see the translator's note. There is debate whether the reference here is to God's preservation of Israel during their wandering in the Sinai desert or his promise to protect and preserve them on their return through the Arabian desert on the way back from Assyria and Babylon (see e.g., Isa 42:14-16; 43:16-21; Jer 16:14-15; 23:7-8). The only finite verbs in vv. 2-3a before the introduction of the quote are perfects which can denote either a past act or a future act viewed as certain of fulfillment (the prophetic perfect; see GKC &#167;106.<i>n</i> and see examples in Jer 11:16; 13:17; 25:14; 28:4). The phrase at the beginning of v. 3 can either refer to temporal (cf. BDB 935 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qojr&#180;</FONT> 2.b and Isa 22:11) or spatial distance (cf. BDB 935 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qojr&#180;</FONT> 2.a[2] and Isa 5:29; 59:14). The verb in the final clause in v. 3 can refer to either the continuance of God's love as in Ps 36:10 (cf. BDB 604 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ev^m*</FONT> Qal 5) or drawing someone to him in electing, caring love as in Hos 11:4 (cf. BDB 604 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ev^m*</FONT> Qal 1). The translation has opted for the prophetic reference to future deliverance because of the preceding context, the use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qojr&#180;m@</FONT> to refer to the far off land of exile in Jer 30:10; 46:27; 51:50, and the reference to survivors from the sword being called on to remember the LORD in that far off land in 51:50.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (31:4)  For the significance of this metaphor see the note on Jer 14:17. Here the emphasis appears on his special love and care for his people and the hint (further developed in vv. 21-22) that, though guilty of sin, he considers them like an innocent young virgin.<br>

The Hebrew word translated "enjoy its fruit" is a technical one that refers to the owner of a vineyard getting to enjoy its fruit in the fifth year after it was planted, the crops of the first three years lying fallow, and that of the fourth being given to the LORD (cf. Lev 19:23-25).<br>

Here reference is made to the watchmen who signaled the special times of the year such as the new moon and festival times when Israel was to go to Jerusalem to worship. Reference is not made to these in the Hebrew Bible but there is a good deal of instruction regarding them in the later Babylonian Talmud.<br>

 <a name="fn1688" href="jer.htm#fnB1688"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tc</b> (31:7)  Or "The LORD will rescue his people. He will deliver those of Israel who remain alive." The translation used in the text follows the Hebrew: "Rescue your people, O LORD, the remnant of Israel." The alternate translation which is preferred by several modern translations (e.g., REB, TEV) and a majority of modern commentaries (see, e.g., J. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 569, J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 273, fn s-s) follows the reading of the Greek version and the Aramaic Targum and appears more appropriate to the context of praise presupposed by the preceding imperatives. The difference in the two readings are the omission of one vowel letter and the confusion of a final <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">E</FONT> and a <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">o</FONT> which are very similar in form. (The Greek presupposes <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">oMu^-ta# hwhy u^yv!oh</FONT> for the Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">EM=u^-ta# hwhy uv^oh</FONT>.) The key to a decision here is the shift from the verbs of praise to the imperative "say" which introduces the quotation; there is a shift from praise to petition. The shift in mood is not uncommon, occurring, for example, in Ps 118:25 and 126:4; it is the shift in mood between praise for what has begun to petition for what is further hoped for. It is easier to explain the origin contextually of the Greek and Targum than it is the Hebrew text, thus the Greek and Targum are probably a secondary smoothing of the text (this is the decision of the editors of the <i>Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i>, 4:263). The mood of prayer also shows up in v. 9 and again in vv. 17-18.<br>
 <a name="fn1689" href="jer.htm#fnB1689"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:8)  The words "And I will reply" are not in the text but the words vv. 8-9 appear to be the answer to the petition at the end of v. 7. These words are supplied in the translation for clarity.<br>

 <a name="fn1691" href="jer.htm#fnB1691"><sup>16</sup></a><b>sn</b> (31:9)  Jer 31:8-9 are reminiscent of the "New Exodus" motif of Isa 40-66 which has already been referred to in Jer 16:14-15; 23:7-8. See especially Isa 35:3-10; 40:3-5, 11; 41:17-20; 42:14-17; 43:16-21; 49:9-13. As there, the New Exodus will so outstrip the old that the old will pale in comparison and be almost forgotten (see Jer 23:7-8).<br>
 <a name="fn1692" href="jer.htm#fnB1692"><sup>17</sup></a><b>sn</b> (31:9)  <i>Ephraim</i> was the second son of Joseph who was elevated to a place of prominence in the family of Jacob by the patriarch's special blessing. It was the strongest tribe in northern Israel and Samaria lay in its territory. It is often used as a poetic parallel for Israel as here. The poetry is not speaking of two separate entities here; it is a way of repeating an idea for emphasis. Moreover, there is no intent to show special preference for northern Israel over Judah. All Israel is metaphorically God's son and the object of his special care and concern (Exod 4:22; Deut 32:6).<br>
 <a name="fn1693" href="jer.htm#fnB1693"><sup>18</sup></a><b>sn</b> (31:11)  Two rather theologically significant metaphors are used in this verse. The Hebrew word translated "will set...free" is a word used in the legal sphere for paying a redemption price to secure the freedom of a person or thing (see, e.g., Exod 13:13, 15). It is used metaphorically and theologically to refer to Israel's deliverance from Egyptian bondage (Deut 15:15; Mic 6:4) and its deliverance from Babylonian exile (Isa 35:10). The word translated "secure their release" is a word used in the sphere of family responsibility where a person paid the price to free an indentured relative (Lev 25:48, 49) or paid the price to restore a relative's property seized to pay a debt (Lev 25:25, 33). This word, too, was used to refer metaphorically and theologically to Israel's deliverance from Egyptian bondage (Exod 6:6) or release from Babylonian exile (Isa 43:1-4; 44:22). These words are traditionally translated "ransom" and "redeem" and are a part of traditional Jewish and Christian vocabulary for physical and spiritual deliverance.<br>

 <a name="fn1697" href="jer.htm#fnB1697"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tc</b> (31:13)  The translation follows the reading of the LXX (Greek version). The Hebrew reads "will dance and be glad, young men and old men together." The Greek version presupposes a Qal imperfect of a rare verb (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WDj=y~</FONT> from the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hd&#180;j*</FONT>; see BDB 292 s.v. II <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hd&#180;j*</FONT> Qal) as opposed to the Hebrew text which reads a common adverb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wD&#180;j=y~</FONT>. The consonantal text is the same but the vocalization is different. There are no other examples of the syntax of the adverb used this way (i.e., of a compound subject added to a third subject) and the vocalization of the Hebrew text can be explained on the basis of a scribe misvocalizing the text based on his greater familiarity with the adverb.<br>
 <a name="fn1698" href="jer.htm#fnB1698"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:14)  <i>Heb</i> "I will satiate the priests with fat."

The word is used more abstractly for "abundance" or "rich food" (see Job 36:16 and BDB 206 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/v#D\</FONT> 1).

It was on the road between Bethel and Bethlehem. Traditionally, Rachel's tomb was located near there at a place called Zelzah (1 Sam 10:2). Rachel was the mother of Joseph and Benjamin and was very concerned about having children because she was barren (Gen 30:1-2) and went to great lengths to have them (Gen 30:3, 14-15, 22-24). She was the grandmother of Ephraim and Manasseh which were two of the major tribes in northern Israel.

The Hebrew verb <i>shub</i> refers both to their turning away from God (v. 19) and to their turning back to him (v. 18). It is also the word that is used for their return to their homeland (vv. 16-17).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (31:19)  The expression <i>the disgraceful things we did in our earlier history</i> refers to the disgrace that accompanied the sins that Israel did in her earlier years before she learned the painful lesson of submission to the LORD through the discipline of exile. For earlier references to the sins of her youth (i.e., in her earlier years as a nation) see 3:24-25; 22:21 and see also 32:29. At the time that these verses were written, neither northern Israel or Judah had expressed the kind of contrition voiced in vv. 18-19. As one commentator notes, the words here are both prophetic and instructive.<br>
 <a name="fn1715" href="jer.htm#fnB1715"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:20)  <i>Heb</i> "Is Ephraim a dear son to me or a child of delight?" For the substitution of Israel for Ephraim and the plural pronouns for the singular see the note on v. 18. According to BDB 210 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">h&amp;</FONT> 1.c the question is rhetorical having the force of an impassioned affirmation.

 <a name="fn1718" href="jer.htm#fnB1718"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:21)  The words "I will say" are not in the text. They are supplied in the translation to mark the transition from the address about Israel in a response to Rachel's weeping (vv. 15-20) to a direct address to Israel which is essentially the answer to Israel's prayer of penitence (cf. Keown, Scalise, Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i>,<i> </i>p. 121.)<br>
 <b>sn</b> (31:21)  The LORD here invites Israel to stop dilly-dallying and prepare themselves to return because he is prepared to do something new and miraculous.<br>
 <a name="fn1719" href="jer.htm#fnB1719"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:21)  <i>Heb</i> "Virgin Israel." For the significance see the study note on 31:3.<br>
 <a name="fn1720" href="jer.htm#fnB1720"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:21)  <i>Heb</i> "Set your mind to the highway, the way which you went." The phrase "the way you went" has been translated "the road you took when you were carried off" to help the reader see the reference to the exile implicit in the context. The verb "which you went" is another example of the old second feminine singular which the Masoretes typically revocalize (Kethib<i> </i><FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yT!k=l*h*</FONT>; Qere<i> </i><FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">T=k=l*h*</FONT>). The vocative has been supplied in the translation at the beginning to help make the transition from third person reference to Ephraim/Israel in the preceding to second person in the following and to identify the referent of the imperatives. Likewise, this line has been moved to the front to show that the reference to setting up sign posts and landmarks is not literal but figurative, referring to making a mental note of the way they took when carried off so that they can easily find their way back. Lines three and four in the Hebrew text read, "Set up sign posts for yourself; set up guideposts/landmarks for yourself." The word translated "telltale signs marking the way" occurs only here. Though its etymology and precise meaning are unknown, all the lexicons agree in translating it as "sign post" or something similar based on the parallelism.<br>
 <a name="fn1721" href="jer.htm#fnB1721"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:22)  The translation "dilly-dally" is suggested by J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 276. The verb occurs only here in this stem (the Hitpael) and only one other time in any other stem (the Qal in Song 5:6). The dictionaries define it as "to turn this way and that" (cf., e.g., BDB 330 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qm^j*</FONT> Hithp.). In the context it refers to turning this way and that looking for the way back.<br>
 <a name="fn1722" href="jer.htm#fnB1722"><sup>47</sup></a><b>sn</b> (31:22)  Israel's backsliding is forgotten and forgiven. They had once been characterized as an apostate people (3:14, 22; the word "apostate" and "unfaithful" are the same in Hebrew) and figuratively depicted as an adulterous wife (3:20). Now they are viewed as having responded to his invitation (compare 31:18-19 with 3:22-25). Hence they are no longer depicted as an unfaithful daughter but as an unsullied virgin (see the literal translation of "my dear children" in vv. 4, 21 and the study note on v. 4.)<br>
 <a name="fn1723" href="jer.htm#fnB1723"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:22)  <i>Heb</i> "For the LORD will create." The person has been shifted to avoid the possible confusion for some readers of a third person reference to the LORD in what has otherwise been a first person address. The verb "will create" is another one of the many examples of the prophetic perfect that have been seen in the book of Jeremiah. For the significance of the verb "create" here see the study note on "bring about something new."<br>
 <a name="fn1724" href="jer.htm#fnB1724"><sup>49</sup></a><b><i>sn</i></b> <i>Heb</i> "create." This word is always used with God as the subject and refers to the production of something new or unique, like the creation of the world and the first man and woman (Gen 1:1; 2:3; 1:27; 5:1) or the creation of a new heavens and a new earth in a new age (Isa 65:17), or the bringing about of new and unique circumstances (Num 16:30). Here reference is made contextually to the new exodus, that marvelous deliverance which will be so great that the old will pale in comparison (see the first note on v. 9).<br>
 <a name="fn1725" href="jer.htm#fnB1725"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:22)  The meaning of this last line is uncertain. The translation has taken it as proverbial for something new and unique. For a fairly complete discussion of most of the options see C. Feinberg, "Jeremiah," <i>Expositor's Bible Commentary</i> 6:571. For the nuance of "protecting" for the verb here see BDB 686 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bb^s*</FONT> Po` 1 and compare the usage in Deut 32:10.<br>
 <a name="fn1726" href="jer.htm#fnB1726"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:23)  <i>Heb</i> "Yahweh of armies, the God of Israel." See 7:3 and the study note of 2:19 for the rendering of this title and an explanation of its significance.<br>
 <a name="fn1727" href="jer.htm#fnB1727"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:23)  <i>Heb</i> "They [i.e., people (the indefinite plural, GKC &#167;144.<i>g</i>)] will again say in the land of Judah and in its cities when I restore their fortunes." For the meaning of the idiom "to restore the fortunes" see the translator's note on 29:14.<br>
 <a name="fn1728" href="jer.htm#fnB1728"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:23)  The words "of Jerusalem" are not in the text but it is implicit in the titles that follow. They have been supplied in the translation for clarity to aid in identifying the referent.<br>
 <a name="fn1729" href="jer.htm#fnB1729"><sup>54</sup></a><b>sn</b> (31:23)  The blessing pronounced on the city of Zion/Jerusalem by the restored exiles looks at the restoration of its once exalted state as the city known for its sanctity and its just dealing (see Isa 1:21 and Ps 122). This was a reversal of the state of Jerusalem in the time of Isaiah and Jeremiah where wickedness not righteousness characterized the inhabitants of the city (cf. Isa 1:21; Jer 4:14; 5:1; 13:27). The blessing here presupposes the rebuilding of the city of Jerusalem and the temple which gave the city its sanctity.<br>
 <a name="fn1730" href="jer.htm#fnB1730"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:24)  The translation "those who move about with their flocks" is based on an emendation of the Hebrew text which reads a third plural Qal perfect (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wus=n&#180;</FONT>) to a masculine plural Qal participle in the construct (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yu@s=n{</FONT>) as suggested in the <i>BHS</i> fn. For the use of the construct participle before a noun with a preposition see GKC &#167;130.<i>a</i>. It is generally agreed that three classes of people are referred to here, townspeople, farmers, and shepherds. But the syntax of the Hebrew sentence is a little awkward: "And they [i.e., "people" (the indefinite plural, GKC &#167;144.<i>g</i>)] will live in it, Judah and all its cities [an apposition of nearer definition (GKC &#167;131.<i>n</i>)], [along with] farmers and those who move about with their flocks." The first line refers awkwardly to the townspeople and the other two classes are added asyndetically (i.e., without the conjunction "and").<br>
 <a name="fn1731" href="jer.htm#fnB1731"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:25)  The verbs here again emphasize that the actions are as good as done (i.e., they are prophetic perfects; cf. GKC &#167;106.<i>n</i>).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (31:25)  For the concept here compare Jer 31:12 where the promise was applied to northern Israel. This represents the reversal of the conditions that would characterize the exiles according to the covenant curse of Deut 28:65-67.<br>
 <a name="fn1732" href="jer.htm#fnB1732"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:26)  Or "When I, Jeremiah, heard this, I woke up and looked around. My sleep had been very pleasant." The text is somewhat enigmatic. It has often been explained as an indication that Jeremiah had received this communication (30:3-31:26) while in a prophetic trance (compare Dan 10:9). However, there is no other indication that this is a vision or a vision report. Keown, Scalise, Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i>,<i> </i>pp. 124, 128-29 suggest that this is a speech of the restored (and refreshed) exiles like that which is formally introduced in v. 23. This speech, however, is not formally introduced. This interpretation is also reflected in the translations of TEV and CEV and is accepted here as fitting the context better and demanding less presuppositions. The Hebrew text reads literally, "Upon this I awoke and looked and my sleep was sweet to me." Keown, Scalise, and Smothers have the best discussion of these two options as well as several other options.<br>
 <a name="fn1733" href="jer.htm#fnB1733"><sup>58</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:27)  <i>Heb</i> "Behold days are coming!" The particle "Behold" is probably used here to emphasize the reality of a fact. See the translator's note on 1:6.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (31:27)  This same expression is found in the introduction to the Book of Consolation (Jer 30:1-3) and in the introduction to the promise of a new agreement (or covenant; 31:31). In all three passages it is emphasized that the conditions apply to both Israel and Judah. The LORD will reverse their fortunes and restore them to their lands (30:3), increase their numbers and build them up (31:27-28), and make a new agreement with them involving forgiveness of sins (31:31-34).<br>
 <a name="fn1734" href="jer.htm#fnB1734"><sup>59</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:27)  <i>Heb</i> "Oracle of the LORD."<br>
 <a name="fn1735" href="jer.htm#fnB1735"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:27)  <i>Heb</i> "Behold, the days are coming and [= when] I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of people and of animals." For the significance of the metaphor see the study note.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (31:27)  The metaphor used here presupposes that drawn in Hos 2:23 (2:25 HT) which is in turn based on the wordplay with Jezreel (meaning "God sows") in Hos 2:22. The figure is that of plant seed in the ground which produces a crop; here what are sown are the "seeds of people and animals." For a similar picture of the repopulating of Israel and Judah see Ezek 36:10-11. The promise here reverses the scene of devastation that Jeremiah had depicted apocalyptically and hyperbolically in Jer 4:23-29 as judgment for Judah's sins.<br>
 <a name="fn1736" href="jer.htm#fnB1736"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:28)  <i>Heb</i> "Just as I watched over them to uproot and to tear down, to destroy and demolish, so I will watch over them to build and to plant." The words here repeat those of 1:10 and 1:12.<br>
 <a name="fn1737" href="jer.htm#fnB1737"><sup>62</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:28)  <i>Heb</i> "Oracle of the LORD."<br>
 <a name="fn1738" href="jer.htm#fnB1738"><sup>63</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:29)  This word only occurs here and in the parallel passage in Ezek 18:2 in the Qal stem and in Eccl 10:10 in the Piel stem. In the latter passage it refers to the bluntness of an axe that has not been sharpened. Here the idea is of the "bluntness" of the teeth, not from having ground them down due to the bitter taste of sour grapes but to the fact that they have lost their "edge," "bite," or "sharpness" because they are numb from the sour taste. For this meaning for the word see W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i> 2:197.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (31:29)  This is a proverbial statement that is also found in Ezek 18:2. It served to articulate the complaint that the present generation was suffering for the accrued sins of their ancestors (cf. Lam 5:7) and that the LORD was hence unjust (Ezek 18:25, 29). However, Jeremiah had repeatedly warned his own generation that they were as guilty or even more so than their ancestors. The ancestors were indeed guilty of sin but the present generation had compounded the problem by their stubborn refusal to turn back to God despite repeated warnings from the prophets and hence God would withhold judgment no longer (cf. especially Jer 16:10-13 and compare Jer 7:24-34; 9:12-16 (9:11-15 HT); 11:1-13).<br>
 <a name="fn1739" href="jer.htm#fnB1739"><sup>64</sup></a><b>sn</b> (31:30)  The LORD answers their charge by stating that each person is responsible for his own sin and will himself bear the consequences. Ezek 18 has a more extended treatment of this and shows that this extends not just to the link between parents and children but between former behavior and future behavior of the same individual. To a certain extent the principle articulated here is anticipatory of the statement in v. 34 which refers to the forgiveness of former sins.<br>
 <a name="fn1740" href="jer.htm#fnB1740"><sup>65</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:31)  <i>Heb</i> "Oracle of the LORD."<br>
 <a name="fn1741" href="jer.htm#fnB1741"><sup>66</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:31)  Traditionally, "a new covenant" (also in vv. 32-22).<br>
 <a name="fn1742" href="jer.htm#fnB1742"><sup>67</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:31)  <i>Heb</i> "the house of Israel and the house of Judah."<br>
 <a name="fn1743" href="jer.htm#fnB1743"><sup>68</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:32)  The word "old" is not in the text but is implicit in the use of the word "new." It is supplied in the translation for greater clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn1744" href="jer.htm#fnB1744"><sup>69</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:32)  <i>Heb</i> "fathers."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (31:32)  This refers to the Mosaic covenant which the nation entered into with God at Sinai and renewed on the plains of Moab (Exod 19-24; Deuteronomy and see the study note on Jer 11:2 for the form this agreement or "covenant" took and its relation to the warnings of the prophets). The renewed document of Deuteronomy was written down and provisions made for periodic public reading and renewal of commitment to it (Deut 31:9-13). Josiah had done this after the discovery of the book of the law (which was either Deuteronomy or a synopsis of it) early in the ministry of Jeremiah (2 Kgs 23:1-4; the date would be near 622 B.C. shortly after Jeremiah began prophesying in 627 [see the study note on Jer 1:2]). But it is apparent from Jeremiah's confrontation with Judah after that time that the commitment of the people was only superficial (cf. Jer 3:10). The prior history of the nations of Israel and Judah and Judah's current practice had been one of persistent violation of this agreement despite repeated warnings of the prophets that God would punish them for that (see especially Jer 7, 11). Because of that, Israel had been exiled (cf., e.g., Jer 3:8), and now Judah was threatened with the same (cf., e.g., Jer 7:15). Jer 30-31 look forward to a time when both Israel and Judah will be regathered, reunited, and under a new agreement which includes the same stipulations but with a different relationship (v. 32).<br>
 <a name="fn1745" href="jer.htm#fnB1745"><sup>70</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:32)  Or "I was their master." See the study note on 3:14.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (31:32)  The metaphor of Yahweh as husband and Israel as wife has been used already in Jer 3 and is implicit in the repeated allusions to idolatry as spiritual adultery or prostitution. The best commentary on the faithfulness of God to his "husband-like" relation is seen in the book of Hosea, especially in Hos 1-3.<br>
 <a name="fn1746" href="jer.htm#fnB1746"><sup>71</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:32)  <i>Heb</i> "Oracle of the LORD."<br>
 <a name="fn1747" href="jer.htm#fnB1747"><sup>72</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:33)  <i>Heb</i> "with the house of Israel." All commentators agree that the term here refers to both the whole nation which was divided into the house of Israel and the house of Judah in v. 30.<br>
 <a name="fn1748" href="jer.htm#fnB1748"><sup>73</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:33)  <i>Heb</i> "after those days." Commentators are generally agreed that this refers to the return from exile and the repopulation of the land referred to in vv. 27-28 and not to something subsequent to the time mentioned in v. 30. This is the sequencing that is also presupposed in other new covenant passages such as Deut 30:1-6; Ezek 11:17-20; 36:24-28.<br>
 <a name="fn1749" href="jer.htm#fnB1749"><sup>74</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:33)  <i>Heb</i> "Oracle of the LORD."<br>

The sentence has been reworded and restructured to avoid the awkwardness of the original style.<br>
 <a name="fn1751" href="jer.htm#fnB1751"><sup>76</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:33)  <i>Heb</i> "in their inward parts." The Hebrew word here refers to the seat of the thoughts, emotions, and decisions (Jer 9:8 [9:7 HT]). It is essentially synonymous with "heart" in Hebrew psychological terms.<br>
 <a name="fn1752" href="jer.htm#fnB1752"><sup>77</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:33)  The words "and minds" is not in the text but is supplied in the translation to bring the English psychology more into line with the Hebrew where the "heart" is the center both of knowing/thinking/reflecting and deciding/willing.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (31:33)  Two contexts are relevant for understanding this statement. First is the context of the first or old agreement which was characterized by a law written on stone tablets (e.g., Exod 32:15-16; 34:1, 28; Deut 4:13; 5:22; 9:10) or in a "book" or "scroll" (Deut 31:9-13) which could be lost (cf. 2 Kgs 22:8), forgotten (Hos 4:6), ignored (Jer 6:19; Amos 4:2), or altered (Jer 8:8). Second is the context of the repeated fault that Jeremiah has found with their stubborn (3:17; 7:24; 9:14; 11:8; 13:10; 16:12; 18:12; 23:17), uncircumcised (4:4; 9:26), and desperately wicked hearts (4:4; 17:9). Radical changes were necessary to get the people to obey the law from the heart and not just pay superficial or lip service to it (3:10; 12:2). Deut 30:1-6; Ezek 11:17-20; 36:24-28 speak of these radical changes. The LORD will remove the "foreskin" of their heart and give them a circumcised heart, or take away their "stony" heart and give them a new heart. With this heart they will be able to obey his laws, statutes, ordinances, and commands (Deut 30:8; Ezek 11:20; 36:27). The new agreement does not entail a new law; it is the same law that Jeremiah has repeatedly accused them of rejecting or ignoring (6:19; 9:13; 16:11; 26:4; 44:10). What does change is their inner commitment to keep it. Jeremiah has already referred to this in Jer 24:7 and will refer to it again in Jer 32:39.<br>
 <a name="fn1753" href="jer.htm#fnB1753"><sup>78</sup></a><b>sn</b> (31:33)  Compare Jer 24:7; 30:22; 31:1 and see the study note on 30:2.<br>
 <a name="fn1754" href="jer.htm#fnB1754"><sup>79</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:34)  <i>Heb</i> "teach..., saying, `Know the LORD.'" The indirect quote has been chosen for stylistic reasons, i.e., to better parallel the following line.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (31:34)  As mentioned in the translator's note on 9:3 (9:2 HT) "knowing" God in covenant contexts like this involves more than just an awareness of who he is (9:23 [9:22 HT]). It involves an acknowledgment of his sovereignty and whole hearted commitment to obedience to him. This is perhaps best seen in the parallelisms in Hos 4:1; 6:6 where "the knowledge of God" is parallel with faithfulness and steadfast love and in the context of Hos 4 refers to obedience to the LORD's commands.<br>
 <a name="fn1755" href="jer.htm#fnB1755"><sup>80</sup></a><b>sn</b> (31:34)  This statement should be understood against the background of Jer 8:8-9 where class distinctions were drawn and certain people were considered to have more awareness and responsibility for knowing the law and also Jer 5:1-5 and 9:3-9 where the sinfulness of Israel was seen to be universal across these class distinctions and no trust was to be placed in friends, neighbors, or relatives because all without distinction had cast off God's yoke (i.e., refused to submit themselves to his authority).<br>
 <a name="fn1756" href="jer.htm#fnB1756"><sup>81</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:34)  The Hebrew particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> that introduces this clause refers to more than just the preceding clause (i.e., that all will know the LORD) but to all of vv. 31-34a (See BDB 474 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> 3.c).<br>
 <a name="fn1757" href="jer.htm#fnB1757"><sup>82</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:35)  <i>Heb</i> "Yahweh of armies." See the study note on 2:19 for this title. In the Hebrew text the verse reads: "Thus says the LORD who provides the sun for light by day, the fixed ordering of the moon and stars for light by night, who stirs up the sea and its waves roar, whose name is Yahweh of armies, `...'" The hymnic introduction to the quote which does not begin until v. 36 has been broken down to avoid a long awkward sentence in English. The word "said" has been translated "made a promise" to reflect the nature of the content in vv. 36-37. The first two lines of the Hebrew poetry are a case of complex or supplementary ellipsis where the complete idea of "providing/establishing the fixed laws" is divided between the two lines (cf. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech </i>, pp. 110-113). The necessity for recombining the ellipsis is obvious from reference to the fixed ordering in the next verse. (Some commentators prefer to delete the word as an erroneous glossing of the word in the following line (see, e.g., J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 277, fn y).)<br>
 <a name="fn1758" href="jer.htm#fnB1758"><sup>83</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:36)  <i>Heb</i> "Oracle of the LORD."<br>

The sentence has been broken up to conform more to modern style.

 <a name="fn1775" href="jer.htm#fnB1775"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:2)  Jer 32:2-5 are parenthetical, giving the background for the actual report of what the LORD said in v. 7. The background is significant because it shows that Jeremiah was predicting the fall of the city and the kingdom and was being held prisoner for doing so. Despite this pessimistic outlook, the LORD wanted Jeremiah to demonstrate his assurance of the future restoration (which has been the topic of the two preceding chapters) by buying a field as a symbolic act that the Israelites would again one day regain possession of their houses, fields, and vineyards (vv. 15, 44). (For other symbolic acts with prophetic import see Jer 13, 19.)<br>
 <a name="fn1776" href="jer.htm#fnB1776"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:2)  According to Jer 39:1 the siege began in Zedekiah's ninth year (i.e., in 589/88 B.C.). It had been interrupted while the Babylonian army was occupied with fighting against an Egyptian force that had invaded Judah. During this period of relaxed siege Jeremiah had attempted to go to his home town in Anathoth to settle some property matters, had been accused of treason, and been thrown into a dungeon (37:11-15). After appealing to Zedekiah he had been moved from the dungeon to the courtyard of the guardhouse connected to the palace (37:21) where he remained confined until Jerusalem was captured in 587/86 B.C. (38:28).<br>
 <a name="fn1777" href="jer.htm#fnB1777"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:2)  <i>Heb</i> "the courtyard of the guarding or place of guarding." This expression occurs only in the book of Jeremiah (32:2, 8, 12; 33:1; 37:21; 38:6, 12, 28; 39:14, 15) and in Neh 3:25. It is not the same as an enclosed prison which is where Jeremiah was initially confined (37:15-16; literally a "house of imprisoning" [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rWsa@h* tyB@</FONT>] or "house of confining" [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">al#K#h^ tyB@</FONT>]). It is said to have been in the palace compound (32:2) near the citadel or upper palace (Neh 3:25). Though it was a place of confinement (32:2; 33:1; 39:15) Jeremiah was able to receive visitors, e.g., his cousin Hanamel (32:8) and the scribe Baruch (32:12), and conduct business there (32:12). According to 32:12 other Judeans were also housed there. A cistern of one of the royal princes, Malchijah, was located in this courtyard, so this is probably not a "prison compound" as NJPS interpret but a courtyard adjacent to a guardhouse or guardpost (so Keown, Scalise, Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i>,<i> </i>p. 151 and compare Neh 12:39 where reference is made to a Gate of the Guard/Guardhouse) used here for housing political prisoners who did not deserve death or solitary confinement as some of the officials though Jeremiah did.<br>

 <a name="fn1779" href="jer.htm#fnB1779"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:3)  The translation represents an attempt to break up a very long Hebrew sentence with several levels of subordination and embedded quotations and also an attempt to capture the rhetorical force of the question "Why..." which is probably an example of what Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, pp.953-54 calls a rhetorical question of expostulation or remonstrance (cf. the translator's note on 26:9 and compare also the question in 36:29. In all three of these cases NJPS translates "How dare you..." which captures the force nicely). The Hebrew<i> </i>text reads, "For Zedekiah king of Judah had confined him, saying, `Why are you prophesying, saying, "Thus says the LORD, `Behold I am giving this city into the hands of the king of Babylon and he will capture it.'"'"<br>

 <a name="fn1782" href="jer.htm#fnB1782"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:5)  This is the verb (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dq^P*</FONT>) that has been met with several times in the book of Jeremiah, most often in the ominous sense of "punish" (e.g., 6:15; 11:22; 23:24) but also in the good sense of "resume concern for" (e.g., 27:22; 29:10). Here it is obviously in the ominous sense referring to his imprisonment and ultimate death (52:11).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (32:5)  Compare Jer 34:2-3 for this same prophecy. The incident in Jer 34:1-7 appears to be earlier than this one. Here Jeremiah is confined to the courtyard of the guardhouse; there he appears to have freedom of movement.<br>

This verse resumes the narrative introduction in v. 1 which was interrupted by the long parenthetical note about historical background. There is again some disjunction in the narrative (compare the translator's notes on 27:2 and 28:1). What was begun as a biographical (third person) narrative turns into an autobiographical (first person) narrative until v. 26 where the third person is again resumed. Again this betrays the hand of the narrator, Baruch.<br>

Under these laws, if a property owner became impoverished and had to sell his land, the nearest male relative had the right and duty to buy it so that it would not pass out of the use of the extended family. The land, however, would not actually belong to Jeremiah because in the year of Jubilee it reverted to its original owner. All Jeremiah was actually buying was the right to use it (Lev 25:13-17). Buying the field, thus, didn't make any sense (thus Jeremiah's complaint in v. 25) other than the fact that the LORD intended to use Jeremiah's act as a symbol of a restored future in the land.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (32:9)  Coins were not in common use until the post-exilic period. Payment in gold and silver was made by cutting off pieces of silver or gold and weighing them in a beam balance using standard weights as the measure.

It is awkward to begin a sentence with "I took..." without finishing the thought, and the long qualifiers in v. 12 make that sentence too long. The sentence is broken up in accordance with contemporary English style. The reference to the "deed of purchase" in v. 12 should be viewed as a plural consisting of both written and sealed copies as is clear from v. 11 and also v. 14. Part of the confusion is due to the nature of this document which consisted of a single papyrus scroll, half of which was rolled up and sealed and the other half which was left "opened" or unsealed. Bright is probably incorrect in assuming that the copies were duplicate since the qualification "containing the order of transfer and the regulations" is only applied to the appositional participle, "the sealed one [or copy]" (contra J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 237-38).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (32:12)  Aramaic documents from a slightly later period help us understand the nature of such deeds. The document consisted of a single papyrus sheet divided in half. One half contained all the particulars and was tightly rolled up, bound with strips of cloth or thread, sealed with wax upon which the parties affixed their seal, and signed by witnesses. The other copy consisted of an abstract and was left loosely rolled and unsealed (i.e., open to be consulted at will). If questions were raised about legality of the contract then the sealed copy could be unsealed and consulted.<br>

The contrast of showing steadfast love to "thousands" to the limitation of punishing the third and fourth generation of children for their parents' sins in Exod 20:5-6; Deut 5:9-10; Exod 34:7 has suggested to many commentators and translators (cf., e.g., NRSV, TEV, NJPS) that reference here is to "thousands of generations." The statement is, of course, rhetorical emphasizing God's great desire to bless as opposed to the reluctant necessity to punish. It is part of the attributes of God spelled out in Exod 34:6-7.<br>

This is typical of hymnic introductions to hymns of praise (cf., e.g., Ps 136) but it is hard to sustain the relative subordination which all goes back to the suffix on "hard for you."

The translation here follows the syntactical understanding reflected also in NJPS. The Hebrew<i> </i>text reads: "you did miracles and marvelous acts in the land of Egypt until this day and in Israel and in mankind and you made for yourself a name as this day." The majority of translations and commentaries understand the phrases "until this day and in Israel and in mankind" to be an elliptical sentence with the preceding verb and objects supplied as reflected in the alternate translation. However, the emphasis on the miraculous deeds in Egypt in this section both before and after this elliptical phrase and the dominant usage of the terms "signs and wonders" to refer to the plagues and other miraculous signs in Egypt calls this interpretation into question. The key here is understanding "both in Israel and in mankind" as an example of a <i>casus pendens </i>construction (a dangling subject, object, or other modifier) before a conjunction introducing the main clause (cf. GKC &#167;111.<i>h</i> and &#167;143.<i>d</i> and compare the usage in Jer 6:19; 33:24; 1 Kgs 15:13). This verse is the topic sentence which is developed further in v. 21 and initiates a narrative history of the distant past that continues until v. 22b where reference is made to the long history of disobedience which has led to the present crisis.<br>

The question is rhetorical expecting an emphatic negative answer (cf. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, p. 949 citing the parallel in Gen 18:14). The Hebrew particle "Behold" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hN}h!</FONT>) introduces the grounds for this rhetorical negative (cf. Lambdin, <i>Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Grammar</i>, &#167;135 (3), p. 170), i.e., "Since I am the LORD, the God of all mankind, there is indeed nothing too hard for me [or, is there anything too hard for me?]."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (32:27)  This statement furnishes the grounds both for the assurance that the city will indeed be delivered over to Nebuchadnezzar (vv. 28-29a) and that it will be restored and repopulated (vv. 37-41). This can be seen from the parallel introductions in vv. 28, "Therefore the LORD says" and "Now therefore the LORD says."

The verb that introduces this clause is a Piel infinitive absolute which is functioning in place of the finite verb (see, e.g., GKC &#167;113.<i>ff</i> and compare usage in Jer 8:15; 14:19. This grammatical point means that the versions cited in <i>BHS</i> fn a may not be reading a different text after all, but may merely be interpreting the form as syntactically equivalent to a finite verb as the present translation has done.).<br>

The god <i>Molech</i> is especially associated with the practice of child sacrifice (Lev 18:21; 20:2-5; 2 Kgs 23:10). In 1 Kgs 11:7 this god is identified as the god of the Ammonites who is also called Milcom in 1 Kgs 11:5; 2 Kgs 23:13. Child sacrifice, however, was not confined to this god; it was also made to the god Baal (Jer 19:5) and to other idols that the Israelites had set up (Ezek 16:20-21). This practice was, however, strictly prohibited in Israel (Lev 18:21; 20:2-5; Deut 12:31; 18:10). It was this practice as well as other pagan rites that Manasseh had instituted in Judah that ultimately led to Judah's demise (2 Kgs 24:3-4). Though Josiah tried to root these pagan practices (2 Kgs 23:4-14) out of Judah he could not do so. The people had only made a pretense of following his reforms; their hearts were still far from God (Jer 3:10; 12:2).<br>

For the use of the Hiphil of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">af*j*</FONT> to refer to the liability for punishment see BDB s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">af*j*</FONT> Hiph 3 and compare the usage in Deut 24:8. Coming at the end as this does, this nuance is much more likely than "cause Judah to sin" which is the normal translation assigned to the verb here. The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/u^m^l=</FONT> that precedes it is here once again introducing a result and not a purpose (compare other clear examples in 27:10, 15). The sentence has been broken down in conformity to contemporary English style and an attempt has been made to make clear that what is detestable and not commanded is not merely child sacrifice to Molech but child sacrifice in general.<br>
 <a name="fn1847" href="jer.htm#fnB1847"><sup>74</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:36)  <i>Heb</i> "you." However, the pronoun is plural and is addressed to more than just Jeremiah (v. 26). It includes Jeremiah and those who have accepted his prophecy of doom.<br>

 <a name="fn1849" href="jer.htm#fnB1849"><sup>76</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:36)  Compare Jer 32:24, 28. In 32:24 this is Jeremiah's statement just before he expresses his perplexity about the LORD's command to buy the field of his cousin in spite of the certainty of the city's demise. In 32:28 it is the LORD's affirmation that the city will indeed fall. Here, the LORD picks up Jeremiah's assessment only to add a further prophesy (vv. 37-41) of what is just as sure to happen (v. 42). This is the real answer to Jeremiah's perplexity. Verses 28-35 are an assurance that the city will indeed be captured and a reiteration again of the reason for its demise. The structure of the two introductions in v. 28 and v. 36 are parallel and flow out of the statement that the LORD is God of all mankind and nothing is too hard for him (neither destruction nor restoration [cf. 1:10]).<br>
 <a name="fn1850" href="jer.htm#fnB1850"><sup>77</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:36)  <i>Heb</i> "And now therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city which you [masc. pl.] are saying has been given [prophetic perfect = will be given] into the hand of the king of Babylon through sword, starvation, and disease." The translation attempts to render the broader structure mentioned in the study note and to break the sentence down in a way that conforms more to contemporary English style and that will lead into the speech which does not begin until the next verse. As in v. 28 the third person introduction has been changed to first person for smoother narrative style in a first person speech (i.e., vv. 27-44 are all the LORD's answer to Jeremiah's prayer). The words "right in" added to "are saying" are intended to reflect the connection between v. 28 and the statement here (which is a repetition of v. 24). I.e., God does not deny that Jeremiah's assessment is correct; he affirms it but has something further to say in answer to Jeremiah's prayer.<br>
 <a name="fn1851" href="jer.htm#fnB1851"><sup>78</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:37)  The verb here should be interpreted as a future perfect; though some of the people have already been exiled (in 605 and 597 B.C.), some have not yet been exiled at the time this prophesy is given (see study note on v. 1 for the date). However, contemporary English style does not regularly use the future perfect, choosing instead to use the simple future or the simple perfect as the present translation has done here.<br>
 <a name="fn1852" href="jer.htm#fnB1852"><sup>79</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:38)  The covenant formula setting forth the basic relationship is reinstituted along with a new covenant (v. 40). See also 24:7; 30:22; 31:1 and the study note on 30:22.<br>
 <a name="fn1853" href="jer.htm#fnB1853"><sup>80</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:39)  <i>Heb</i> "I will give to them one heart and one way to [= in order that they may] fear me all the days for good to them." The phrase "one heart" refers both to unanimity of will and accord (cf. 1 Chr 12:38 [12:39 HT]; 2 Chr 30:12) and to singleness of purpose or intent (cf. Ezek 11:19 and see BDB 525 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bl@</FONT> 4 where reference is made to "inclinations, resolutions, and determinations of the will"). The phrase "one way" refers to one way of life or conduct (cf. BDB 203 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Er\D\</FONT> 6.a where reference is made to moral action and character), a way of life that is further qualified by the goal of showing "fear, reverence, respect" for the LORD. The Hebrew sentence has been broken up to avoid a long complex sentence in English which is contrary to contemporary English style. However, an attempt has been made to preserve all the connections of the original.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (32:39)  Other passages also speak about the "single-minded purpose" (<i>Heb</i> "one heart") and "living in a way that shows respect for me." Deut 30:6-8 speaks of a circumcised heart that will love him, obey him, and keep his commands. Ezek 11:20-21 speaks of the removal of a stony heart and the giving of a single-minded, "fleshy" heart and a new spirit that will follow his decrees and keep his laws. Ezek 36:26-27 speaks of the removal of a stony heart and the giving of a new, "fleshy" heart and a new spirit and an infusion of God's own spirit so that they will be able to follow his decrees and keep his laws. Jer 24:7 speaks of the giving of a (new) heart so that they might "know" him. And Jer 31:33 speaks of God writing his law on their hearts. All this shows that there is a new motivation and a new enablement for fulfilling the old stipulations, especially that of whole-hearted devotion to him (cf. Deut 6:4-6).<br>
 <a name="fn1854" href="jer.htm#fnB1854"><sup>81</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:40)  <i>Heb</i> "an everlasting covenant." For the rationale for the rendering "agreement" and the nature of the biblical covenants see the study note on 11:2.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (32:40)  For other references to the lasting (or everlasting) nature of the new covenant see Isa 55:3; 61:8; Jer 50:5; Ezek 16:60; 37:26. The new covenant appears to be similar to the ancient Near Eastern covenants of grants whereby a great king gave a loyal vassal a grant of land or dynastic dominion over a realm in perpetuity in recognition of past loyalty. The right to such was perpetual as long as the great king exercised dominion, but the actual enjoyment could be forfeited by individual members of the vassal's dynasty. The best example of such an agreement in the OT is the Davidic covenant where the dynasty was given perpetual right to rule over Israel. Individual kings might be disciplined and their right to enjoy dominion taken away, but the dynasty still maintained the right to rule (see 2 Sam 23:5; Ps 89:26-37 and note especially 1 Kgs 11:23-39). The new covenant appears to be the renewal of God's promise to Abraham to always be the God of his descendants and for his descendants to be his special people (Gen 17:7) something they appear to have forfeited by their disobedience (see Hos 1:9). However, under the new agreement (or new covenant) he promises to never stop doing them good and grants them a new heart, a new spirit, the infusion of his own spirit, and the love and reverence necessary to keep from turning away from him. The new agreement is not based on their past loyalty but on his gracious forgiveness and his gifts.<br>
 <a name="fn1855" href="jer.htm#fnB1855"><sup>82</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:40)  Or "stop being gracious to them" or, "stop blessing them with good"; <i>Heb</i> "turn back from them to do good to them."<br>

However, as has been noted several times, "heart" in Hebrew is more the center of the volition (and intellect) than the center of emotions as it is in English. Both translations are intended to reflect the difference in psychology.<br>
 <a name="fn1857" href="jer.htm#fnB1857"><sup>84</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:40)  The words "never again" are not in the text but are implicit from the context and are supplied not only by this translation but by a number of others.<br>

The long Hebrew sentence has again been restructured to better conform to contemporary English style. The indefinite "they will buy" is treated as a passive. It is followed by three infinitive absolutes which substitute for the finite verb (cf. GKC &#167;113.<i>y</i>) which is a common feature of the style of the book of Jeremiah.<br>

I formed it in such a way as to firmly establish it"; <i>Heb</i> "Thus says the LORD who makes/does it, the LORD who forms it to establish it, whose name is the LORD." It is unclear what the antecedent of "it" is. The Greek version supplies the object "the earth." However, as the committee for <i>The Hebrew Old Testament Project</i> 4:269 notes, this is probably a smoothing of a text which had no object other than the pronoun. No other text or version has an object other than the pronoun. It could be argued that "the earth" is to be understood as the intended referent from other contexts within the book of Jeremiah (Jer 10:12, 16; 51:15) where these verbs refer to the LORD as creator and from the prior context in 32:17 where the LORD's power as creator is the basis for the assertion that nothing is too hard for him. This is the object that is supplied in a number of modern translations and commentaries. However, the use of the feminine singular pronoun in other contexts to refer to an indefinite reality which is spelled out in the preceding or following context (cf. 2 Kgs 19:25; Isa 22:11; 37:26; 44:7) lends credence to the suggestion by the committee for <i>The Hebrew Old Testament Project</i> that the pronoun refers to the work or plan of the LORD, a view which is reflected in the NJPS and has been adopted here. For the use of the verb "form" here in the sense of "plan" see BDB 427 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rx^y&#180;</FONT> 2.b and compare the usage in Isa 22:11; 37:26. The best discussion of options is given in Keown, Scalise, Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i>,<i> </i>pp. 169-70 who see the pronoun referring ahead to the great and hidden things of v. 3. As in several other cases our translation has opted for a first person introduction rather than the third person of the original because the LORD himself is speaking.<br>
 <a name="fn1871" href="jer.htm#fnB1871"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:3)  This passive participle or adjective is normally used to describe cities or walls as "fortified" or "inaccessible."

Keown, Scalise, Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i>,<i> </i>p. 170 make the interesting observation that the word is used here in a context in which the fortifications of Jerusalem are about to fall to the Babylonians; the fortified things in God's secret counsel fall through answer to prayer.<br>

 <a name="fn1874" href="jer.htm#fnB1874"><sup>7</sup></a><b>sn</b> (33:5)  This refers to the tearing down of buildings within the city to strengthen the wall or to fill gaps in it which had been broken down by the Babylonian battering rams. For a parallel to this during the siege of Sennacherib in the time of Hezekiah see Isa 22:10; 2 Chr 32:5. These torn-down buildings were also used as burial mounds for those who died in the fighting or through starvation and disease during the siege. The siege prohibited them from taking the bodies outside the city for burial and leaving them in their houses or in the streets would have defiled them.<br>
 <a name="fn1875" href="jer.htm#fnB1875"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:5)  <i>Heb</i> "Because I have hidden my face from." The modern equivalent for this gesture of rejection is "to turn the back on." See Ps 13:1 for comparable usage. The perfect is to be interpreted as a perfect of resolve (cf. <i>IBHS</i> &#167;30.5.1d, p. 489 and compare the usage in Ruth 4:3).<br>
 <a name="fn1876" href="jer.htm#fnB1876"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:5)  The translation and meaning of vv. 4-5 are somewhat uncertain. The translation and precise meaning of vv. 4-5 are uncertain at a number of points due to some difficult syntactical constructions and some debate about the text and meaning of several words. The text reads more literally, "<b>33:4 </b>For thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah which have been torn down on account the siege ramps and the sword <b>33:5</b> going to fight the Chaldeans and to fill them with the dead bodies of the men whom I have killed in my anger and in my wrath and on account of all whose wickedness I have hidden my face from this city." There are two difficult syntactical forms (1) the participle at the beginning of v. 5 "going [or, those going] to fight" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ya!B*</FONT>) and (2) the infinitive plus suffix that introduces the next clause "and to fill them" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;a*l=m^l=W</FONT>). The translation has interpreted the former as a verbal use of the participle with an indefinite subject "they" (= the defenders of Jerusalem who have torn down the buildings; cf. GKC &#167;144.<i>i</i> for this point of grammar). The conjunction plus preposition plus infinitive construct has been interpreted as equivalent to a finite verb (cf. <i>IBHS</i> &#167;36.3.2a, p. 611, i.e., "and they will fill them [the houses and buildings of v. 4]"). Adopting the Greek text of these two verses would produce a smoother reading. It reads "For thus says the LORD concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah which have been pulled down for mounds and fortifications to fight against the Chaldeans and to fill it [should be "them"] with the corpses of men whom I smote in my anger and my wrath and I turned away my face from them [rather than from "this city" of the Hebrew text] for all their wickedness: Behold I will..." The Greek does not have the problem with the participle because it has seen it as part of a word meaning fortification. This also eliminates the problem with the infinitive because it is interpreted as parallel with "to fight." I.e., the defenders used these torn-down buildings for defensive fortifications and for burial places. It would be tempting to follow this reading. However, there is no graphically close form for "fortification" that would explain how the more difficult <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ya!B*</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">br\j*h#</FONT> of the Hebrew text arose and there is doubt whether <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toll=s)</FONT> can refer to a defense mound. W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 2:221, 225 has suggested reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yK!r~j&amp;h^</FONT> in place of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">br\j*h </FONT>in the technical sense of "crenels," the gaps between the raised portion on top of the wall (which raised portion he calls "merlons" and equates with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toll=s)</FONT>). He does not, however, further suggest seeing <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ya!B*</FONT> as part of this corrupted form, choosing to see it rather as a gloss. His emendation and interpretation, however, have been justly criticized as violating the usage of both <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toll=s)</FONT> which is elsewhere "siege mound" and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yK!r~j&amp;</FONT> which elsewhere refers only to the latticed opening of a window (Song 2:9). Until a more acceptable explanation of how the difficult Hebrew text could have arisen from the Greek, the Hebrew should be retained, though it is admittedly awkward. Keown, Scalise, Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i>,<i> </i>pp. 166, 172 have perhaps the best discussion of the issues and the options involved here.<br>

 <a name="fn1907" href="jer.htm#fnB1907"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:21)  The very complex and elliptical syntax of the original Hebrew of vv. 20-21 has been broken down to better conform with contemporary English style. The text reads somewhat literally (after the addition of a couple of phrases which have been left out by ellipsis): "Thus says the LORD, `If you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night so that there is not to be daytime and night in their proper time then also my covenant can be broken with my servant David so that there is not to him a son reigning upon his throne [and also my covenant can be broken] with the Levites [so there are not] priests who minister to me." The two phrases in brackets are elliptical, the first serving double duty for the prepositional phrase "with the Levites" as well as "with David" and the second serving double duty with the noun "priests" which parallels "a son." The noun "priests" is not serving here as appositional because that phrase is always "the priests, the Levites," never "the Levites, the priests."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (33:21)  This refers to a reaffirmation of the Davidic covenant (cf., e.g., 2 Sam 7:11-16, 25-29; Ps 89:3-4, 19-29) and God's covenant with the Levites (cf. Num 25:10-13; Mal 2:4-6; Deut 32:8-11).<br>

The word "seed of" does not carry over to the "the Levites" as a noun governing two genitives because "the Levites" has the accusative marker in front of it. The sentence has been broken down in conformity with contemporary English style.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (33:22)  Context makes it clear that what is in view is an innumerable line of descendants from the righteous ruler that the LORD raises up over Israel and Judah after their regathering and restoration to the land. What is in view, then, is a reinstitution or reinstatement of the Davidic covenant of grant, the perpetual right of the Davidic dynasty to rule over the nation of Israel for all time (see also v. 26). This is guaranteed by the creation order which is the object of both God's creative decree (Gen 1:14-19) and his covenant with Noah after the flood (Gen 8:22). (For further discussion on the nature of a covenant of grant see the study note on 32:40.) The rejection of the lines of Jehoiakim (36:30) and Jeconiah (22:30) and the certain captivity and death of Zedekiah (32:4) may have called into question the continuance of the Davidic promise which always had a certain conditional nature to it (cf. 1 Kgs 2:4; 8:25; 9:5). This promise and this guarantee show that the covenant of grant still stands and will ultimately find its fulfillment. Because this promise never found its fulfillment after the return from exile, it is left to the NT to show how it is fulfilled (cf., e.g., Matt 1:1-17 where it is emphasized that Jesus is the son (and heir) of both Abraham and David).<br>

This is an example of an object prepositioned before the verb and resumed by a redundant pronoun to throw emphasis of focus on it (called <i>casus pendens</i> in the grammars; cf. GKC &#167;143.<i>d</i>). Some commentators identify the "two families" as those of David and Levi mentioned in the previous verses, and some identify them as the families of the Israelites and of David mentioned in the next verse. However, the next clause in this verse and the emphasis on the restoration and regathering of Israel and Judah in this section (cf. 33:7, 14) show that the reference is to Israel and Judah (see also 30:3, 4; 31:27, 31 and 3:18).<br>

The phrase "before them" refers to their estimation, their mental view (cf. BDB s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hn\P*</FONT> II.4.a[g]). Hence it means they look with disdain on the people being a nation again (cf. BDB s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dou</FONT> 1.a[b] for the usage of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dou</FONT> here).<br>

Here the promise is in v. 26 following the contrary to fact condition in v. 25. The Hebrew text of vv. 25-26 reads: "Thus says the LORD, "If I have not established my covenant with day and night [and] the laws/statutes of heaven and earth, also I could reject the seed of Jacob and David my servant from taking from his seed as rulers over the seed of Abraham..." The syntax of the original is a little awkward because it involves the verbs "establish" and "reject" governing two objects, the first governing two similar objects "my covenant" and "the regulations" and the second governing two dissimilar objects "the seed of Jacob" and "my servant David from taking [so as not to take]." The translation has sought to remove these awkward syntactical constructions and also break down the long complex original sentence in such a way as to retain its original intent, i.e., the guarantee of the continuance of the seed of Jacob and of the rule of a line of David's descendants over them based on the fixed order of God's creation decrees.<br>

This has been the emphasis on this section which is called by some commentators "The Book of Consolation." Jeremiah's emphasis up until chapters 30-33 had been on judgment but he was also called to be the prophet of restoration (cf. Jer 1:10). Promises of restoration though rare up to this point have, however, occurred on occasion (see, e.g., Jer 3:18; 23:5-7; 24:6-7; 29:10-14).<br>

The sentence is obviously too long and the qualifiers obviously too ill-defined to translate literally. This same introductory formula has occurred in 7:1; 11:1; 18:1; 21:1; 30:1; 32:1 but without such a long introductory phrase. It is generally agreed that the phrase "all the peoples" should be seen as a parallel term to "all the kingdoms" under the qualifying "under the dominion of his hand/ control" and what is referred to are contingent forces supplied by these vassal kingdoms and peoples under the terms of their vassal treaties with Nebuchadnezzar. Some of the nature of the make-up of these forces may be seen from a reference to Babylonian, Aramean, Moabite, and Ammonite raiders in the earlier attacks on Jerusalem during the reign of Jehoiakim (2 Kgs 24:2).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (34:1)  It is difficult to assign dates to passages which have no dating formulas but there is sufficient detail in this passage to show that this incident occurred sometime early in the siege of Jerusalem while Jeremiah was still free to come and go (see v. 2 and compare 37:4 and see the second study note on 32:2). The Babylonian forces blockaded Jerusalem and attacked the outlying cities, reducing them one by one until Jerusalem had no further help. According to v. 7 Azekah and Lachish in the western foothills still held out and there is evidence from some of the correspondence from Lachish at this period that help was being sought from Egypt.<br>

The intent of this sentence is to serve as a circumstantial sentence to v. 6 (= "while the army..."). That thought is picked up by "he did this while...." The long complex sentence in v. 7 has been broken down and qualifying material placed in the proper places to convey the same information in shorter English sentences in conformity with contemporary English style.<br>
 <a name="fn1927" href="jer.htm#fnB1927"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:8)  Usually translated "covenant." See the study note on 11:2 for the rationale for the translation here.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (34:8)  There are no details regarding the nature of this covenant, but it was probably a parity agreement in which the people agreed to free their slaves in exchange for some concessions from the king (see the study note on 11:2 for more details on the nature of ancient Near Eastern covenants). More details about this covenant are given in vv. 15, 18-19 where it is said to have been made before the LORD in the temple and involved passing between the pieces of a cut-up calf. Hence it involved their swearing an oath invoking the LORD's name (cf. Gen 21:23; 31:51-53; 1 Sam 20:42) and pronouncing self-maledictory curses on themselves calling down on themselves a fate similar to that of the dead calf if they failed to keep it. (This latter practice is illustrated in treaty documents from the ancient Near East and is reflected in the covenant ceremony in Gen 15:8-16.)<br>
 <a name="fn1928" href="jer.htm#fnB1928"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:9)  <i>Heb</i> "after King Zedekiah made a covenant...to proclaim liberty to them [the slaves mentioned in the next verse] so that each would send away free his male slave and his female slave, the Hebrew man and the Hebrew woman, so that a man would not hold them in bondage, namely a Judean, his brother [this latter phrase is explicative of "them" because it repeats the preposition in front of "them"]." The complex Hebrew syntax has been broken down into shorter English sentences but an attempt has been made to retain the proper subordinations.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (34:9)  Through economic necessity some of the poorer people of the land had on occasion to sell themselves or their children to wealthier Hebrew landowners. The terms of their servitude were strictly regulated under Hebrew law (cf. Exod 21:2-11; Lev 25:39-55; Deut 15:12-18). In brief, no Hebrew was to serve a fellow Hebrew for any longer than six years. In the seventh year he or she was to go free. The period could even be shortened if the year of jubilee intervened since all debts were to be canceled, freedom restored, and indentured property returned in that year. Some see the agreement here coming in conjunction with such a jubilee year since it involved the freedom of all slaves regardless of how long they had served. Others see this agreement as paralleling an old Babylonian practice of a king declaring liberty for slaves and canceling all debts generally at the beginning of his reign (but also at other significant times within it) in order to ingratiate himself with his subjects.<br>
 <a name="fn1929" href="jer.htm#fnB1929"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:10)  <i>Heb</i> "And they complied, [that is] all the leaders and all the people who entered into the agreement [or, covenant] that they would each let his male slave and his female slave go free so as not to hold them in bondage any longer; they complied and they let [them] go." The verb "they complied" (<i>Heb</i> "they hearkened") is repeated at the end after the lengthy description of the subject. This is characteristic of Hebrew style. The translation has resolved the complex sentence by making the relative clauses modifying the subject independent sentences describing the situational background before mentioning the main focus, "they had complied and let them go."<br>
 <a name="fn1930" href="jer.htm#fnB1930"><sup>15</sup></a><b>sn</b> (34:11)  Most commentators are agreed that the incident referred to here occurred during the period of relief from the siege provided by the Babylonians going off to fight against the Egyptians who were apparently coming to Zedekiah's aid (compare vv. 21-22 with 37:5, 7). The freeing of the slaves had occurred earlier, under the crisis of the siege while the people were more responsive to the LORD due to the threat of destruction (cf. v. 15).<br>
 <a name="fn1931" href="jer.htm#fnB1931"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:11)  <i>Heb</i> "they had brought them into subjection for male and female slaves." However, the qualification of "male and female" is already clear from the preceding and is unnecessary to the English sentence.<br>

This is the resumption of the introduction in v. 8 after the lengthy description of the situation that had precipitated the LORD's message to Jeremiah.

 <a name="fn1933" href="jer.htm#fnB1933"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:12)  The words, "He told him to tell them," are not in the text but are implicit from the address that follows. It is directed to "you" (masculine plural) and criticizes the behavior of the people who had done what is described in v. 11 and pronounces judgment on them for doing so; it is not addressed to Jeremiah himself. These words are supplied in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn1934" href="jer.htm#fnB1934"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:13)  <i>Heb</i> "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, `...'" The style adopted here has been used to avoid a longer, more complex English sentence.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (34:13)  This refers to the Mosaic covenant, initiated at Mount Sinai and renewed on the plains of Moab. The statement "I brought you out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage" functions as the "historical prologue" in the Ten Commandments which is the LORD's vassal treaty with Israel in miniature. (See the study note on 11:2 and see Exod 20:2; Deut 5:6 and Exod 34:8. As such it was a motivating factor in their pledge of loyalty to him. This statement was also invoked within the law itself as a motivation for kindly treatment of slaves including their emancipation (see Deut 15:15).)<br>
 <a name="fn1937" href="jer.htm#fnB1937"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:13)  <i>Heb</i> "made a covenant, saying." This was only one of several stipulations of the covenant.

 <a name="fn1941" href="jer.htm#fnB1941"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (34:16)  The verb at the beginning of v. 15 and v. 16 are the same in the Hebrew. They had two changes of heart (<i>Heb</i> "you turned"), one that was pleasing to him (<i>Heb</i> "right in his eyes") and one that showed they did not honor him (<i>Heb</i> "profaned [or belittled] his name").<br>
 <a name="fn1942" href="jer.htm#fnB1942"><sup>27</sup></a><b>sn</b> (34:16)  <i>Heb</i> "you profaned my name." His name had been invoked in the oath confirming the covenant. Breaking the covenant involved taking his name in vain (cf. Exod 20:7; Deut 5:11; Jer 5:2). Hence the one who bore the name was not treated with the special honor and reverence due him (see the study note on 23:27 for the significance of "name" in the OT).<br>
 <a name="fn1943" href="jer.htm#fnB1943"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:16)  <i>Heb</i> "and you brought them into subjection to be to you for male and female slaves."

 <a name="fn1944" href="jer.htm#fnB1944"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:17)  The Hebrew text has a compound object, the two terms of which have been synonyms in vv. 14, 15. Keown, Scalise, Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i>,<i> </i>p. 189 make the interesting observation that these two terms (<i>Heb</i> "brother" and "neighbor") emphasize the relationships that should have taken precedence over their being viewed as mere slaves.<br>
 <a name="fn1945" href="jer.htm#fnB1945"><sup>30</sup></a><b>sn</b> (34:17)  This is, of course, a metaphorical and ironical use of the term "to grant freedom to."

 <a name="fn1949" href="jer.htm#fnB1949"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:18)  There is a little confusion in the syntax of this section because the noun "the calf" does not have any formal conjunction or preposition with it showing how it relates to the rest of the sentence. KJV treats it and the following words as though they were a temporal clause modifying "covenant which they made." The majority of modern translations and commentaries, however, understand it as a second accusative after the verb + object "I will make the men." This fits under the category of what GKC &#167;118.<i>r</i> calls an accusative of comparison (compare usage in Isa 21:8; Zech 2:8). Stated baldly, "I will make the people...the calf", it is, however, more forceful than the formal use of the noun + preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">K=</FONT> just as metaphors are generally more forceful than similes. The whole verse is one long, complex sentence in Hebrew: "I will make the men who broke my covenant [referring to the Mosaic covenant containing the stipulation to free slaves after six years] [and] who did not keep the terms of the covenant which they made before me [referring to their agreement to free their slaves] [like] the calf which they cut in two and passed between its pieces." The sentence has been broken down into shorter sentences in conformity with contemporary English style.<br>

 <a name="fn1951" href="jer.htm#fnB1951"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:19)  This verse is not actually a sentence in the Hebrew original but is a prepositioned object to the verb in v. 20, "I will hand them over." This construction is called <i>casus pendens</i> in the older grammars and is used to call attention to a subject or object (cf. GKC &#167;143.<i>d</i> and compare the usage in 33:24). The same nondescript "I will punish" which was used to resolve the complex sentence in the previous verse has been chosen to introduce the objects here before the more specific "I will hand them over" in the next verse.<br>

The last two "and into the hand" phrases are each giving further explication of "their enemies" (the conjunction is explicative [cf. BDB 252 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">w+</FONT> 1.b]). The sentence has been broken down into shorter English sentences in conformity with contemporary English style.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (34:21)  This refers to the relief offered by the withdrawal of the Babylonian troops to fight against the Egyptians which were coming to Zedekiah's aid (cf. 37:5, 7, 11).<br>

 <a name="fn1955" href="jer.htm#fnB1955"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (35:1)  The introductory statement here shows that this incident is earlier than those in Jer 32-34 which all take place in the reign of Zedekiah. Jehoiakim ruled from 609/8 B.C. until 598/97 B.C. and his brother Zedekiah followed him after a brief reign of three months by Jekoiakim's son who was captured by Nebuchadnezzar and taken to Babylon. Zedekiah ruled from 598/7 B.C. until the kingdom fell in 587/86. The position of this chapter is out of chronological order emphasizing the theme of covenant infidelity (Jer 34; 35:12-17) versus the faithfulness to his commands that God expected from Israel as illustrated by the Rechabites' faithfulness to the commands of their progenitor. This is thus another one of those symbolic acts in Jeremiah which have significance to the message of the book (compare Jer 13, 19). This incident likely took place during the time that people living in the countryside like the Rechabites were forced to take shelter in the fortified cities because of the raiding parties that Nebuchadnezzar had sent against Jehoiakim after he had rebelled against him in 603 B.C. (compare v. 11 and Jer 4:5 with 2 Kgs 24:1-2).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (35:2)  Nothing is known about the <i>Rechabite community</i> other than what is said about them in this chapter. From vv. 7-8 it appears that they were a nomadic tribe that had resisted settling down and taking up farming. They had also agreed to abstain from drinking wine. Most scholars agree in equating the Jonadab son of Rechab mentioned as the leader who had instituted these strictures as the same Jonadab who assisted Jehu in his religious purge of Baalism following the reign of Ahab (2 Kgs 10:15, 23-24). If this is the case, the Rechabites followed these same rules for almost 250 years because Jehu's purge of Baalism and the beginning of his reign was in 841 B.C. and the incident here took place some time after Jehoiakim's rebellion in 603 B.C. (see the study note on v. 1).<br>

The terms "sojourn" and "sojourner" referred to a person who resided in a country not his own, without the rights and privileges of citizenship as a member of a nation, state, or principality. In the ancient Near East such people were dependent on the laws of hospitality rather than the laws of state for protection and provision of legal rights. Perhaps the best illustration of this is Abraham who "sojourned" among the Philistines and the Hittites in Canaan and was dependent upon them for grazing and water rights and for a place to bury his wife (cf. Gen 20-24). What is described here is the typical lifestyle of a nomadic tribe.<br>

The shift from direct address to indirect address which characterizes this verse and the next may reflect the LORD's rejection of the people he is addressing.

For the first part of this idiom see 33:17-18 where it is applied to David always having a descendant to occupy the throne and the Levites will always have priests to offer up sacrifices. For the latter part of the idiom "to stand before" referring to service see BDB 764 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dm^u*</FONT> 1.e and compare the usage in 1 Kgs 1:2; 2 Kgs 3:14; Jer 15:19; Deut 10:8. As comparison with those passages will show, it refers to attending on, or serving a superior, a king, or the LORD. It is used of both prophets (e.g., 1 Kgs 17:1) and priests (e.g., Deut 10:8) serving the LORD. Its most common use is to refer to priestly service. The nature of the service is not further defined in this case, though several of the commentaries point out a Mishnaic tradition that the Rechabites later were given the function of bringing wood for the altar.<br>
 <a name="fn1982" href="jer.htm#fnB1982"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (36:1)  The <i>fourth year that Jehoiakim...was ruling over Judah</i> would have been 605/4 B.C. Jehoiakim began his rule in 609/8 B.C. after his father Josiah was killed by Pharaoh Necho at Megiddo. Necho had installed him as puppet king in place of his brother Jehoahaz who was deposed by Necho after a reign of only three months (2 Kgs 23:31-35). According to Jer 46:2 that was the year in which Nebuchadnezzar defeated Jehoiakim's suzerain Necho at Carchemish. That was also the same year that Jerusalem came under attack and submitted to Babylonian control after a brief siege (Dan 1:1; see the study note on 25:1 for the reason for the difference in the dating between Jer 25:1; 36:2 and Dan 1:1). These events confirmed what Jeremiah had been saying about the foe from the north (4:6; 6:1; 15:12) and would have provided the impetus for the hopes that the people would repent if they were reminded about what Jeremiah had been saying.<br>
 <a name="fn1983" href="jer.htm#fnB1983"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:1)  <i>Heb</i> "This word came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah the king of Judah, saying."<br>
 <a name="fn1984" href="jer.htm#fnB1984"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (36:2)  <i>Heb</i> "a roll [or, scroll] of a document." Scrolls consisted of pieces of leather or parchment sewn together and rolled up on wooden rollers. The writing was written from right to left and from top to bottom in columns and the scroll unrolled from the left roller and rolled onto the right one as the scroll was read. The scroll varied in length depending on the contents. This scroll was probably not all that long since it was read three times in a single day (vv. 10-11, 15-16, 21-23).<br>
 <a name="fn1985" href="jer.htm#fnB1985"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (36:2)  The intent is hardly that of giving a verbatim report of everything that the LORD had told him to say or of everything that he had actually said. What the scroll undoubtedly contained was a synopsis of Jeremiah's messages as constructed from his memory.<br>
 <a name="fn1986" href="jer.htm#fnB1986"><sup>5</sup></a><b>sn</b> (36:2)  This refers to the messages that Jeremiah delivered during the last eighteen years of Josiah, the three month reign of Jehoahaz and the first four years of Jehoiakim's reign (the period between Josiah's thirteenth year [cf. 1:2] and the fourth year of Jehoiakim [v. 1]). The exact content of this scroll is unknown since many of the messages in the present book are undated. It is also not known what relation this scroll had to the present form of the book of Jeremiah, since this scroll was destroyed and another one written that contained more than this one did (cf. v. 32). Since Jeremiah continued his ministry down to the fall of Jerusalem in 587/6 B.C. (1:2) and beyond (cf. Jer 40-44) much more was added to those two scrolls even later.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (36:3)  The offer of withdrawal of punishment for sin is consistent with the principles of Jer 18:7-8 and the temple sermon delivered early in the reign of this king (cf. 26:1-3; 7:5-7).<br>
 <a name="fn1989" href="jer.htm#fnB1989"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:4)  <i>Heb</i> "Then Baruch wrote down on a scroll from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD which he [the LORD] had spoken to him [Jeremiah]." The syntax of the Hebrew sentence is awkward and hard to reproduce "literally" in any meaningful way. The English sentence has been restructured to reproduce all the pertinent facts in more simplified language.<br>
 <a name="fn1990" href="jer.htm#fnB1990"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:5)  <i>Heb</i> "I am restrained; I cannot go into." The word "restrained" is used elsewhere in Jeremiah of his being confined to the courtyard of the guardhouse (33:1; 39:15). However, that occurred only later during the tenth year of Zedekiah (Jer 32:1-2) and Jeremiah appears here to be free to come and go as he pleased (vv. 19, 26). The word is used in the active voice of the LORD preventing Sarah from having a baby (Gen 16:2). The probable nuance is here "I am prevented/ debarred" from being able to go. No reason is given why he was prevented/debarred. It has been plausibly suggested that he was prohibited from going into the temple any longer because of the scathing sermon he delivered there earlier (Jer 26:1-3; 7:1-15).<br>
 <a name="fn1991" href="jer.htm#fnB1991"><sup>10</sup></a><b>sn</b> (36:6)  Regular fast days were not a part of Israel's religious calendar. Rather fast days were called on special occasions, i.e., in times of drought or a locust plague (Joel 1:14; 2:15), or during a military crisis (2 Chr 20:3), or after defeat in battle (1 Sam 31:13; 2 Sam 1:12). A fast day was likely chosen for the reading of the scroll because the people would be more mindful of the crisis they were in and be in more of a repentant mood. The events referred to in the study note on v. 1 would have provided the basis for Jeremiah's anticipation of a fast day when the scroll could be read.<br>
 <a name="fn1992" href="jer.htm#fnB1992"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:6)  <i>Heb</i> "So you go and read from the scroll which you have written from my mouth the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the house of the LORD on a fast day, and in that way [for the explanation of this rendering see below] you will be reading them in the ears of all Judah [= the people of Judah] who come from their towns [i.e., to the temple to fast]." Again the syntax of the original is awkward, separating several of the qualifying phrases from the word or phrase they are intended to modify. In most of the "literal" translations the emphasis on "what the LORD said" tends to get lost and it looks like two separate groups are to be addressed rather than one. The intent of the phrase is to define who the people are who will hear; the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">w~</FONT> that introduces the clause is explicative (BDB 252 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">w~</FONT> 1.b) and the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;G~</FONT> is used to emphasize the explicative "all Judah who come in from their towns" (cf. BDB 169 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;G~</FONT> 2). If some force were to be given to the "literal" rendering of that particle here it would be "actually." This is the group that is to be addressed according to v. 3. The complex Hebrew sentence has been restructured to include all the relevant information in more comprehensible and shorter English sentences.<br>
 <a name="fn1993" href="jer.htm#fnB1993"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:7)  <i>Heb</i> "will turn each one from his wicked way."<br>
 <a name="fn1994" href="jer.htm#fnB1994"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:7)  <i>Heb</i> "For great is the anger and the wrath which the LORD has spoken against this people." The translation uses the more active form which is more in keeping with contemporary English style.<br>
 <a name="fn1995" href="jer.htm#fnB1995"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:8)  <i>Heb</i> "And Baruch son of Neriah did according to all that the prophet Jeremiah commanded him with regard to reading from the scroll the words of the LORD in the temple of the LORD." The sentence has been broken down and the modifiers placed where they belong to better conform to contemporary English style.<br>
 <a name="fn1996" href="jer.htm#fnB1996"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:9)  There is some debate about the syntax of the words translated "All the people living in Jerusalem and all the people who came into Jerusalem from the towns in Judah." As the sentence is structured in Hebrew it looks like these words are the subject of "proclaim a fast." However, most commentaries point out that the people themselves would hardly proclaim a fast; they would be summoned to fast (cf. 1 Kgs 21:9, 12; Jonah 3:7). Hence many see these words as the object of the verb which has an impersonal subject "they." This is most likely unless with J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 180 the word "proclaim" is used in a looser sense as "observed." The translation has chosen to follow this latter tack rather than use the impersonal (or an equivalent passive) construction in English. For a similar problem see Jonah 3:5 which precedes the official proclamation in 3:7. The Hebrew text reads: "In the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month they proclaimed a fast before the LORD, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah into Jerusalem." The sentence has been broken down and restructured to better conform with contemporary English style.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (36:9)  Judging from v. 22 this was one of the winter months meaning that the reckoning is based on the calendar which starts with April rather than the one which starts with September (Nisan to Nisan rather than Tishri to Tishri). The ninth month would have been Kislev which corresponds roughly to December. According to Babylonian historical records this is the same year and the same month when Ashkelon was captured and sacked. The surrender of Jerusalem and the subsequent looting of the temple in the previous year (Dan 1:1) and the return of the menacing presence of Nebuchadnezzar in the near vicinity were probably the impetus for the fast.<br>
 <a name="fn1997" href="jer.htm#fnB1997"><sup>16</sup></a><b>sn</b> (36:10)  <i>Shaphan</i> had been <i>the royal secretary</i> under Jehoiakim's father's rule. During the course of his official duties the book of the law had been discovered and he had read it and reported its contents to Josiah who instituted sweeping reforms on the basis of his obedience to it. (See 2 Kgs 22 and note especially vv. 3, 8, 10.) If the Shaphan mentioned in 26:14 is the same person as this, Gemariah would have been the brother of the man who spoke up on Jeremiah's behalf when the priests and prophets sought to have him killed.<br>
 <a name="fn1998" href="jer.htm#fnB1998"><sup>17</sup></a><b>sn</b> (36:10)  It is generally agreed that this is the same as the inner court mentioned in 1 Kgs 6:36; 7:12. It is called "upper" here because it stood above (cf. 1 Kgs 7:12) the outer court where all the people were standing.<br>
 <a name="fn1999" href="jer.htm#fnB1999"><sup>18</sup></a><b>sn</b> (36:10)  The <i>New Gate</i> is the same gate where Jeremiah had been accused of falsely claiming the LORD's authority for his "treasonous" prophecies according to 26:10-11.

 <a name="fn2000" href="jer.htm#fnB2000"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:10)  The syntax of the original is complicated due to all the qualifying terms: <i>Heb</i> "And Baruch read from the scroll the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD in (i.e., in the entrance of) the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan the scribe in the upper court at the entrance of the New Gate in the house of the LORD in the ears of all the people." The sentence has been broken down and restructured to contain all the same information in shorter English sentences that better conform with contemporary English style.<br>
 <a name="fn2001" href="jer.htm#fnB2001"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:11)  <i>Heb</i> "Micaiah son of Gemariah son of Shaphan heard all the words of the LORD from upon the scroll." The words "heard Baruch read" are implicit from the context and are supplied in the translation for smoothness.<br>
 <a name="fn2002" href="jer.htm#fnB2002"><sup>21</sup></a><b>sn</b> (36:12)  If, as many believe, this man was the same as the Elishama mentioned in Jer 41:1; 2 Kgs 25:25, he was also a member of the royal family.<br>
 <a name="fn2003" href="jer.htm#fnB2003"><sup>22</sup></a><b>sn</b> (36:12)  This man has already been mentioned in Jer 26:22 as the official who was sent to Egypt to extradite the prophet Uriah that Jehoiakim had executed. Though he was instrumental in the death of that prophet, he appears to have been favorably disposed to Jeremiah or at least impressed by the seriousness of his messages, because he is one of the officials that urged Baruch and Jeremiah to hide (v. 19), and he counseled Jehoiakim not to burn the scroll (v. 25).<br>
 <a name="fn2004" href="jer.htm#fnB2004"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:13)  <i>Heb</i> "Micaiah reported to them all the words which he heard when Baruch read from the scroll in the ears of the people."<br>

 <a name="fn2006" href="jer.htm#fnB2006"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:14)  The original has another example of a prepositioned object (called <i>casus pendens</i> in the grammars; cf. GKC &#167;143.<i>b</i> [a]) which is intended to focus attention on "the scroll." The Hebrew sentence reads: "The scroll which you read from it in the ears of the people take it and come." Any attempt to carry over this emphasis into the English translation would be awkward. Likewise, the order of the two imperatives has been reversed as more natural in English.<br>
 <a name="fn2007" href="jer.htm#fnB2007"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:14)  <i>Heb</i> "So Baruch son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and went to them." The translation adopted seems more natural to contemporary idiom.<br>

Elsewhere this has been rendered "in the hearing of" or "where they could hear." All three of those idioms sound unnatural in this context. The mere personal pronoun seems adequate.<br>
 <a name="fn2009" href="jer.htm#fnB2009"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:16)  <i>Heb</i> "all the words."<br>
 <a name="fn2010" href="jer.htm#fnB2010"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:16)  According to BDB 808 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dj^P*</FONT> Qal 1 and 40 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la#</FONT> 3.a, this is an example of the "pregnant" use of a preposition where an implied verb has to be supplied in the translation to conform the normal range of the preposition with the verb that is governing it. The Hebrew text reads: "they feared unto one another." BDB translates "they turned in dread to each other." The translation adopted seems more appropriate in this context.<br>
 <a name="fn2011" href="jer.htm#fnB2011"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:16)  <i>Heb</i> "We must certainly report to the king all these things."

BDB 183 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rb*D&#180;</FONT> IV.3) rather than "words" because a verbatim report of all the words in the scroll is scarcely meant. The present translation has chosen to use a form that suggests a summary report of all the matters spoken about in the scroll rather than the indefinite "things."<br>
 <a name="fn2012" href="jer.htm#fnB2012"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:17)  Or "Did Jeremiah dictate them to you?" The words "Do they actually come from Jeremiah's mouth?" assume that the last phrase (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wyP!m!</FONT>) is a question, either without the formal <i>he</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">h&amp;</FONT>) interrogative (see GKC &#167;150.<i>a</i> and compare usage in 1 Sam 16:4; Prov 5:16) or with a letter supplied from the end of the preceding word (single writing of a letter following the same letter [haplography]; so the majority of modern commentaries). The word is missing in the Greek version. The presence of this same word at the beginning of the answer in the next verse suggests that this was a question (probably without the <i>he </i>interrogative to make it more emphatic) since the common way to answer affirmatively is to repeat the emphatic word in the question (cf. GKC &#167;150.<i>n</i> and compare usage in Gen 24:58). The intent of the question is to make sure that these were actually Jeremiah's words not Baruch's own creation (cf. Jer 42:2-3 for a similar suspicion).<br>
 <a name="fn2013" href="jer.htm#fnB2013"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:18)  The verbal forms emphasize that each word came from his mouth. The first verb is an imperfect which emphasizes repeated action in past time and the second verb is a participle which emphasizes ongoing action. J. Gibson, <i>Davidson's Introductory Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;63a, p. 74 calls the usage of the imperfect here distributive (see Gen 2:19; 1 Sam 18:5). However, it is a little awkward to try to express this nuance in contemporary English. Even though it is not reflected in the translation, it is noted here for future reference.<br>
 <a name="fn2014" href="jer.htm#fnB2014"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:19)  The verbs here are both direct imperatives but it sounds awkward to say "You and Jeremiah, go and hide" in contemporary English. The same force is accomplished with the obligative.<br>

 <a name="fn2017" href="jer.htm#fnB2017"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:20)  Both here and in the next verse the Hebrew has "in the ears of" before "the king" (and also before "all the officials"). As in v. 15 these words are not represented in the translation due to the awkwardness of the idiom in contemporary English (see the translator's note on v. 15).<br>
 <a name="fn2018" href="jer.htm#fnB2018"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:21)  <i>Heb</i> "and Jehudi read it." However, Jehudi has been the subject of the preceding; so it would be awkward in English to use the personal subject. The translation has chosen to bring out the idea that Jehudi himself read it by using the reflexive.<br>
 <a name="fn2019" href="jer.htm#fnB2019"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:22)  <i>Heb</i> "in the autumn house." Commentators are agreed that this was not a separate building or palace but the winter quarters in the palace.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (36:22)  Larger houses, including the palace, were two-storied buildings with a lower quarters better suited for the cold of winter and an upper quarters which was better ventilated to provide cool in the summer. Since this was the ninth month (December) the king had taken up residence in the lower, warmer quarters which were equipped with a portable fire pot or brazier to keep him warm.<br>
 <a name="fn2020" href="jer.htm#fnB2020"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tc</b> (36:22)  <i>Heb</i> "the fire in the firepot was burning before him." The translation assumes that the word "fire" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">va@</FONT>) has dropped out after the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta#</FONT> because of the similar beginnings of the two words (called parablepsis or homoioarcton by K. McCarter, <i>Textual Criticism</i>, pp. 39-40). The word "fire" is found in the Greek, Syriac, and Targumic translations according to <i>BHS</i>. The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta@</FONT> should be retained rather than dropped as an erroneous writing of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">va@</FONT>. Its presence is to be explained as the usage of the sign of the accusative introducing a new subject (cf. BDB 85 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta#</FONT> 3.<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">a</FONT> and compare the usage in 27:8; 38:16 [in the Kethib]; 45:4).<br>
 <a name="fn2021" href="jer.htm#fnB2021"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:23)  <i>Heb</i> "doors." This is the only time the word "door" is used in this way but all the commentaries and lexicons agree that it means "columns." The meaning is figurative based on the similarity of shape.<br>
 <a name="fn2022" href="jer.htm#fnB2022"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:23)  <i>Heb</i> "he." The majority of commentaries and translations are agreed that "he" is the king. However, since a penknife (<i>Heb</i> "a scribe's razor") is used to cut the columns off, it is possible that Jehudi himself did it. However, even if Jehudi himself did it, he was acting on the king's orders.<br>
 <a name="fn2023" href="jer.htm#fnB2023"><sup>42</sup></a><b>sn</b> (36:23)  <i>Heb</i> "a scribe's razor." There is some irony involved here since a scribe's razor was used to trim the sheets to be sewn together, scrape them in preparation for writing, and to erase errors. What was normally used to prepare the scroll was used to destroy it.<br>
 <a name="fn2024" href="jer.htm#fnB2024"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:23)  <i>Heb</i> "until the whole scroll was consumed upon the fire which was in the fire pot."<br>

The sentence has been broken up into two shorter sentences to better conform to English style and some of the terms explained (e.g., tore their clothes) for the sake of clarity.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (36:24)  There are some interesting wordplays and contrasts involved here. The action of the king and his attendants should be contrasted with that of the officials who heard the same things read (v. 16). The king and his officials did not tear their garments in grief and sorrow; instead the king cut up the scroll (the words "tear" and "cut off" are the same in Hebrew [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ur~q*</FONT>]). Likewise, the actions of Jehoiakim and his attendants is to be contrasted with that of his father Josiah who some twenty or more years earlier tore his clothes in grief and sorrow (2 Kgs 22:11-20) and led the people in renewing their commitment to the covenant (2 Kgs 23:1-3). That was what the LORD had hoped would happen when the king and the people heard the warnings of Jeremiah (Jer 36:2-3). Instead, Jehoiakim expressed his contempt for the word of God by destroying the scroll.<br>
 <a name="fn2026" href="jer.htm#fnB2026"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:25)  <i>Heb</i> "And also Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah urged [or, had urged] the king not to burn the scroll, but he did not listen to them." The translation attempts to lessen the clash in chronological sequencing with the preceding. This sentence is essentially a flash back to a time before the scroll was totally burned (v. 23).<br>
 <a name="fn2027" href="jer.htm#fnB2027"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:26)  <i>Heb</i> "the son of the king." Many of the commentaries express doubt that this actually refers to Jehoiakim's own son since Jehoiakim was only about thirty at this time and one of his sons would not have been old enough to have been in such a position of authority. The same doubt is expressed about the use of this term in 38:6 and in 1 Kgs 22:26. The term need not refer to the ruling king's own son but one of the royal princes.<br>
 <a name="fn2028" href="jer.htm#fnB2028"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:27)  <i>Heb</i> "Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah after the king had burned the scroll and the words [= containing the words] which Baruch wrote down from the mouth of Jeremiah, saying."<br>
 <a name="fn2029" href="jer.htm#fnB2029"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:28)  <i>Heb</i> "Return, take another." The verb "return" is used in the sense of repetition "take again" (cf.

 <a name="fn2033" href="jer.htm#fnB2033"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:29)  <i>Heb</i> "You burned this scroll, saying, `Why did you write on it, saying, "The king of Babylon will certainly come [the infinitive absolute before the finite verb expresses certainty here as several places elsewhere in Jeremiah] and destroy this land and exterminate from it both man and beast."'" The sentence raises several difficulties for translating literally. I.e., the "you" in "why did you write" is undefined, though it obviously refers to Jeremiah. The gerund "saying" that introduces `Why did you write' doesn't fit very well with "you burned the scroll." Gerunds of this sort are normally explanatory. Lastly, there is no indication in the narrative that Jehoiakim ever directly asked Jeremiah this question. In fact, he had been hidden out of sight so Jehoiakim couldn't confront him. The question is presented rhetorically, expressing Jehoiakim's thoughts or intents and giving the rational for burning the scroll, i.e., he questioned Jeremiah's right to say such things. The translation has attempted to be as literal as possible without resolving some of these difficulties. One level of embedded quotes has been eliminated for greater simplicity. For the rendering of "How dare you" for the interrogative "why do you" see the translator's note on 26:9<br>

Jer 22:30; and see the study notes on 22:24, 30).<br>

The translation uses the more active form in the last line because of the tendency in contemporary English style to avoid the passive. It also uses the words "everything" for "all the words" and "messages" for "words" because those are legitimate usages of these phrases, and they avoid the mistaken impression that Jeremiah repeated verbatim the words on the former scroll or repeated verbatim the messages that he had delivered during the course of the preceding twenty-three years.<br>

 <a name="fn2041" href="jer.htm#fnB2041"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (37:2)  These two verses (37:1-2) are introductory to chs. 37-38 and are intended to characterize Zedekiah and his regime as disobedient just like Jehoiakim and his regime had been (Jer 36:27; cf. 2 Kgs 24:19-20). This characterization is important because Zedekiah is portrayed in the incidents that follow in 37-38 as seeking the LORD's help or seeking a word from the LORD. However though he did send to inquire of Jeremiah three times, he did not pay heed to the warnings that he received in reply and was ultimately responsible for the fall of Jerusalem (Jer 39). As elsewhere in the book of Jeremiah, Jeconiah's reign is passed over in silence because it was negligible and because Jeremiah did not wish to legitimize the hopes that many in Israel and Babylon had in his returning from exile and resuming rule over Judah (see further the study notes on 22:24, 30 and 33:30).<br>
 <a name="fn2042" href="jer.htm#fnB2042"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (37:3)  This is the second of two delegations that Zedekiah sent to Jeremiah to ask him to pray for a miraculous deliverance. Both of them are against the background of the siege of Jerusalem which was instigated by Zedekiah's rebelling against Nebuchadnezzar and sending to Egypt for help (cf. Ezek 17:15). The earlier delegation (21:1-2) was sent before Nebuchadnezzar had clamped down on Jerusalem because the Judean forces at that time were still fighting against the Babylonian forces in the open field (see 21:4 and the translator's note there). Here the siege has been lifted because the Babylonian troops had heard a report that the Egyptian army was on the way into Palestine to give the Judeans the promised aid (vv. 5, 7). The request is briefer here than in 21:2 but the intent is no doubt the same (see also the study note on 21:2).<br>

The sentence has been restructured and reworded to give greater emphasis to the most pertinent fact, i.e., that the siege had been temporarily lifted. The word "temporarily" is not in the text but is implicit from the rest of the context. It is supplied in the translation here to better show that the information in vv. 4-5 is all parenthetical, providing a background for the oracle that will follow.

 <b>sn</b> (37:5)  The Pharaoh referred to here is Pharaoh Hophra who is named in Jer 44:30. He ruled from 589-570 B.C. Shortly after he began to rule, Zedekiah had been enticed by some of the officials in his court to appeal to him for aid. This act of rebellion quickly brought Nebuchadnezzar's wrath and he invaded Judah, blockading Jerusalem and reducing the fortified cities of Judah one by one. According to Jer 39:1 the siege began in Zedekiah's ninth year (589/88 B.C.) and lasted until his eleventh year when Jerusalem fell (587/86 B.C.). The army of Pharaoh likely came sometime during 588 B.C.<br>

 <a name="fn2050" href="jer.htm#fnB2050"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:7)  Or "to ask me what will happen." The dominant usage of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vr~D&#180;</FONT> is to "inquire" in the sense of gaining information about what will happen (cf., e.g., 1 Kgs 14:5; 2 Kgs 8:8; 22:7-8) but it is also used in the sense of "seeking help" from (cf., e.g., Isa 31:1; 2 Chr 16:12; 20:3). The latter nuance appears appropriate in Jer 20:2 where Zedekiah is hoping for some miraculous intervention. That nuance also appears appropriate here where Zedekiah has sent messengers to ask Jeremiah to intercede on their behalf. However, it is also possible that the intent of both verbs is to find out from God whether the Egyptian mission will succeed and more permanent relief from the siege will be had.<br>

The first person "I, the LORD," has been used because the whole of vv. 7-8 has been a quote from the LORD and it would be confusing to go back and start a separate quote.

However, there does not seem to be any alternative that would enable a simpler style and still retain the causal and conditional connections that give this sentence the rhetorical force that it has in the original. The condition is, of course, purely hypothetical and the consequence a poetic exaggeration. The intent is to assure Zedekiah that there is absolutely no hope of the city being spared.<br>

For the rendering "temporarily withdrawn from Jerusalem" see the translator's note on v. 5.

 <a name="fn2059" href="jer.htm#fnB2059"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:12)  The meaning of this last sentence is somewhat uncertain. The Hebrew expression here occurs nowhere else in the Hebrew Bible and its meaning is debated. The verb is pointed as a shortened form of the Hiphil infinitive construct of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ql^j*</FONT> (see GKC &#167;53.<i>q</i> for explanation of the phenomenon and other examples). There are, however, no other examples of the use of this verb in the Hiphil. BDB 324 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ql^j*</FONT> Hiph defines it as "receive a portion" and explains it as a denominative from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ql#j@</FONT>, "portion," but say that the form is dubious. KBL s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ql^j*</FONT> Hif defines it as "take part in dividing" but that does not fit the prepositional phrase that follows (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;V*m!</FONT>, "from there") as well as "to receive a portion." The Greek version did not understand this of dividing property but of conducting business. Later revisions of the Greek and the Latin version, however, did understand it of "taking a share." The translation of BDB has been expanded to better reflect the probable situation. For the meaning of "his family" for the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;u^</FONT> compare the usage in Job 18:19. For a fuller discussion of the probable situation see J. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i>, pp. 633-34.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (37:12)  Though some commentators disagree, this transaction should not be viewed as subsequent to the transaction recorded in Jer 32 and seen as an attempt to take possession of a field that he had already bought. That transaction took place sometime later after he had been confined to the courtyard of the guardhouse (compare 32:2 with 37:21) and involved his buying a near relative's field. The word used here refers to "getting one's own share" (compare 1 Sam 30:24; Josh 15:13, and see also Mic 2:4) not taking possession of someone else's. "There" refers to the territory of Benjamin just mentioned but more specifically to Jeremiah's hometown, Anathoth (cf. 1:1).<br>

The passive construction "Jeremiah had been put" has been used to avoid the indefinite subject "they" or the addition of "the officials." For the translation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">syr]s*</FONT> as "official" here rather than "eunuch" see the translator's note on 29:2 and see also the usage in 34:19.

This clause is circumstantial to the following clause; thus "while the king was..." Most commentators agree that the reference to sitting in the gate here likely refers to the same kind of judicial context that has been posited for 26:10 (see the translator's note there for further references). Hence the translation uses "sitting" with the more technical "holding court" to better reflect the probable situation.<br>

The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta@</FONT> before "they have thrown" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wkyl!v=h! rv#a&amp; ta@</FONT>) is explanatory or further definition of "all they have done to" (i.e., the particle is repeated for apposition). The verb form "and he is sure to die" is an unusual use of the <i>vav</i> consecutive + imperfect that the grammars see as giving a logical consequence without a past nuance (cf. GKC &#167;111.<i>l</i> and <i>IBHS</i> &#167;33.3.1f., p. 558).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (38:9)  "Because there isn't any food left in the city" is rhetorical exaggeration; the food didn't run out until just before the city fell. Perhaps the intent is to refer to the fact that there was no food in the city for people so confined (i.e., in solitary confinement).<br>

Though the difference in "three" and "thirty" involves minimal emendation (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hv*Ov=</FONT> for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yv!Ov=</FONT>) there is no textual or versional evidence for it except for one Hebrew MS.

This is a plausible emendation which would involve dropping out <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lm#</FONT> due to its similarity with the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la#</FONT> which precedes it. However, there is no textual or versional evidence for such a reading and the compound preposition is not in itself objectionable (cf. BDB 1066 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tj^T^</FONT> III.1.a). The Greek version reads "the part underground" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jr\a*h* tj^T^ la#</FONT>) in place of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rx*oah* tj^T^ la#</FONT>.

The sentence has been broken down and restructured to better conform with contemporary English style. The infinitive absolute in the condition emphasizes the one condition, i.e., going out or surrendering (cf. Jo&uuml;on, Muraoka, <i>A Grammar of Biblical Hebrew</i>, &#167;123g, p. 423 and compare usage in Exod 15:26).

According to most commentators it refers here to the false prophets and counselors who urged the king to rebel against Nebuchadnezzar. The verb translated "misled" is a verb that often refers to inciting or instigating someone to do something, often with negative connotations (so BDB 694 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tWs</FONT> Hiph 2). It is generally translated "deceive" or "mislead" in 2 Kgs 18:32; 2 Chr 32:11, 15. Here it refers to the fact that his pro-Egyptian counselors induced him to rebel. They have proven too powerful for him and prevailed on him (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l= lk)y&#180;</FONT>; see BDB 408 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lk)y&#180;</FONT> 2.b) to follow a policy which will prove detrimental to him, his family, and the city. The phrase "your feet have sunk in the mire" is figurative for being entangled in great difficulties (so BDB 371 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ub^f*</FONT> Hoph and compare the usage in the highly figurative description of trouble in Ps 69:2 [69:3 HT]). The figure has been interpreted here to give the average reader some idea of the situation.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (38:22)  The taunt song here refers to the fact that Zedekiah had been incited into rebellion by pro-Egyptian nobles in his court who prevailed on him to seek aid from the new Egyptian Pharaoh in 589 B.C. and withhold tribute from Nebuchadnezzar. This led to the downfall of the city which is depicted in Jeremiah's vision from the standpoint of its effects on the king himself and his family.<br>

The majority of the Hebrew MSS read "and you will burn down this city." This reading is accepted by the majority of modern commentaries and translations. Few of the commentaries, however, bother to explain the fact that the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta#</FONT>, which normally marks the accusative object, is functioning here as the subject. For this point of grammar see BDB 85 s.v. I <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta@</FONT> 1.b. Or this may be another case where <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta@</FONT> introduces a new subject (see BDB 85 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta@</FONT> 3.<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">a</FONT> and see usage in 27:8; 36:22).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (38:24)  This is probably not a threat that the king himself will kill Jeremiah, but a premonition that if the pro-Egyptian party that was seeking to kill Jeremiah found out about the conversation they would go ahead and kill Jeremiah (cf. 38:2-4).<br>
 <a name="fn2131" href="jer.htm#fnB2131"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (38:25)  The phrase "and what the king said to you" is actually at the end of the verse, but most commentators see it as also under the governance of "tell us" and many commentaries and translations move the clause forward for the sake of English style as has been done here.<br>
 <a name="fn2132" href="jer.htm#fnB2132"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (38:25)  Or "lest we kill you"; <i>Heb</i> "and we will not kill you," which as stated in the translator's note on 37:20 introduces a negative purpose (or result) clause. See 37:20, 38:24 for parallel usage.<br>
 <a name="fn2133" href="jer.htm#fnB2133"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (38:26)  Verses 25-26 form a long compound, complex conditional sentence. The condition is found in v. 25 and contains a long quote. The consequence is found in v. 26 and contains another long quote. The Hebrew sentence literally reads: "And if the officials hear that I have talked with you and come to you and say to you, `Please tell us what you said to the king. Do not hide from us and we will not kill you [so that we will not kill you] and [tell us] what the king said to you,' then tell them."

 <a name="fn2138" href="jer.htm#fnB2138"><sup>59</sup></a><b>tn</b> (38:28)  <i>Heb</i> "And Jeremiah stayed/remained in the courtyard of the guardhouse..." The translation once again intends to reflect the situation. Jeremiah had a secret meeting with the king at the third entrance to the temple (v. 14). He was returned to the courtyard of the guardhouse (cf. v. 13) after the conversation with the king where the officials came to question him (v. 27). He was not sent back to the dungeon in Jonathan's house as he feared, but was left confined in the courtyard of the guardhouse.<br>
 <a name="fn2139" href="jer.htm#fnB2139"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tc</b> (38:28)  The precise meaning of this line and its relation to the context are somewhat uncertain. This line is missing from the Greek and Syriac versions and from a few Hebrew MSS. Some translations and commentaries omit it as a double writing of the final words of the preceding line (see, e.g., REB, Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 2:268). Others see it as misplaced from the beginning of 39:3 (see, e.g., NRSV, TEV, J.Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 245). The clause probably does belong syntactically with 39:3 (i.e., <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rv#a&amp;K^</FONT> introduces a temporal clause which is resumed by the <i>vav</i> consecutive on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wab)Y&#180;w~</FONT> (see BDB 455 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rv#a&amp;K^</FONT> 3), but it should not be moved there because there is no textual evidence for doing so. The intervening verses are to be interpreted as parenthetical, giving the background for the events that follow (see, e.g., the translation in the <i>Hebrew Old Testament Project</i>, 4:280). The chapter is not so much concerned with describing how Jerusalem fell as it is with contrasting the fate of Zedekiah who disregarded the word of the LORD with the fate of Jeremiah and that of Jeremiah's benefactor Ebed Melech. The best way to treat the line without actually moving it before 39:3a is to treat it as a heading as has been done here.<br>

For a good discussion of the options see fn 71, p. 341 of F. Huey, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 341. Most commentaries follow the general lead of J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah,</i> p. 243 as the present translation has done here. However, the second name is not emended on the basis of v. 13 as Bright does, nor is the second Nergal-Sharezer regarded as the same man as the first and the information on the two combined as he does. The first Nergal-Sharezer is generally identified on the basis of Babylonian records as the man who usurped the throne from Nebuchadnezzar's son, Awel-Marduk or Evil-Merodach as he is known in the OT (Jer 52:31; 2 Kgs 25:27). The present translation renders the two technical Babylonian terms "Rab-Saris" (only in Jer 39:3, 13; 2 Kgs 18:17) and "Rab-Mag" (only in Jer 39:3, 13) as "chief officer" and "high official" without knowing precisely what offices they held. This has been done to give the modern reader some feeling of their high position without specifying exactly what their precise positions were (i.e., the generic has been used for the [unknown] specific).<br>
 <a name="fn2143" href="jer.htm#fnB2143"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (39:3)  <i>Heb</i> "sat." The precise meaning of this phrase is not altogether clear, but J.

In the translation the general subject has been eliminated and the list of the "real" subjects used instead; this eliminates the dashes or commas typical of some modern translations.<br>

It reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;u*h* tyB@-ta#w+</FONT> "and the house of the people" which many explain as a collective use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ty]B^</FONT>. However, no parallels are cited by any of the commentaries, grammars, or lexicons for such a use. It is more likely that the words <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yT@B*-ta#w+ hwhy</FONT> have fallen out of the text due to similar beginnings. The words <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwhy tyB@-ta#w+</FONT> are found in the parallel texts cited in the marginal note. The Greek version is no help here because vv. 4-13 are omitted, probably due to the similarities in ending of vv. 3, 13 (i.e., homoioteleuton of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lb#B* El#m#</FONT>).<br>

 <a name="fn2155" href="jer.htm#fnB2155"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tc</b> (39:9)  The translation is based on an emendation of the text which leaves out "the rest of the people who were left" as a double writing of the same phrase at the beginning of the verse.

However, it is easier to explain the phrase as a dittography of the phrase at the beginning (which is exactly the same except <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ryu!h*</FONT> follows it). The text is redundant because it refers twice to the same group of people. The Hebrew text reads: "And the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to him and the rest of the people Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried into exile to Babylon."

This is the first reference to this individual whom Nebuchadnezzar appointed governor over the people who were left to live in Judah (cf. 40:5; 2 Kgs 25:22). His father was the man who spoke up for Jeremiah when he was accused of being a false prophet by some of the priests and prophets (26:24). His grandfather was the royal secretary under Josiah who brought the discovery of the book of the law to Josiah's attention, read it to him, and was involved in helping Josiah institute his reforms (2 Kgs 22:8-10).<br>
 <a name="fn2163" href="jer.htm#fnB2163"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (39:14)  The meaning of the last phrase is uncertain. An alternate translation is "to take him home with him." The text reads literally "to bring him into the house." However, it is unclear whether "the house" refers to Jeremiah's house or to Gedaliah's. The fact that Nebuzaradan later offers Jeremiah the option of going back to Gedaliah (40:5) suggests that the house is here Gedaliah's where Jeremiah would be looked out for in accord with Nebuchadnezzar's command (v. 12).<br>
 <a name="fn2164" href="jer.htm#fnB2164"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (39:14)  Many translate this last clause as a conclusion or summary remark, "So Jeremiah stayed..." However, it is better to translate it as an adversative because it probably refers to the fact that rather than staying with Gedaliah in the governor's residence Jeremiah stayed among the people. That is how he wound up being led off as a prisoner to Ramah. See further the study note on 40:1. According to <i>IBHS</i> &#167;33. 2.1d, p. 550 the <i>vav</i> consecutive can have either of these values (see examples 11 and 12 for the adversative or contrastive nuance).<br>
 <a name="fn2165" href="jer.htm#fnB2165"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (39:15)  <i>Jer 39:15-18. </i>This incident is out of chronological order (see Jer 38:7-13). It is placed here either due to a desire not to interrupt the sequential ordering of events centering on Jeremiah's imprisonment and his release (38:14-39:14) or to contrast God's care and concern for the faithful (Ebed-Melech who, though a foreigner, trusted in God) with his harsh treatment of the faithless (Zedekiah who, though informed of God's will, was too weak-willed in the face of opposition by his courtiers to carry it out).<br>
 <a name="fn2166" href="jer.htm#fnB2166"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (39:15)  <i>Heb</i> "Now the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah while he...saying."

For a discussion of the form and function of such disjunctive clauses see <i>IBHS</i> &#167;39.2.3, pp. 650-652. This example most closely fits the description and function of example 12, Ruth 4:18, 21-22 on p. 652.<br>

Moreover, Ebed-Melech was an official attached to the royal court and would have had access to the courtyard of the guardhouse (38:7, 13). Jeremiah would not have had to leave the courtyard of the guardhouse to "go and tell" him something.<br>

 <a name="fn2172" href="jer.htm#fnB2172"><sup>33</sup></a><b>sn</b> (39:17)  Some commentators see this as a reference to the princes from whose clutches Ebed-Melech delivered Jeremiah (38:7-13). However, it is clear that in this context it refers to those that he would fear when the LORD brings about the threatened disaster, i.e., the Babylonians who are attacking the city.<br>
 <a name="fn2173" href="jer.htm#fnB2173"><sup>34</sup></a><b>sn</b> (39:18)  <i>Heb</i> "you will not fall by the sword." In the context this would include death in battle and execution as a prisoner of war.<br>

 <a name="fn2176" href="jer.htm#fnB2176"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:1)  <i>Heb</i> "The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD." This phrase regularly introduces the LORD's directions to Jeremiah which immediately follow (cf. 7:1; 11:1; 18:1; 30:1; 34:1; 35:1). In 21:1; 44:1 it introduces a word of the LORD that Jeremiah communicates to others. However, no directions to Jeremiah follow here nor does any oracle that Jeremiah passes on to the people. Some commentators explain this as a heading parallel to that in 1:1-3 (which refers to messages and incidents in the life of Jeremiah up to the fall of Jerusalem) introducing the oracles that Jeremiah delivered after the fall of Jerusalem. However, no oracles follow until 42:9. It is possible that the intervening material supply background material for the oracle that is introduced in 42:7. An analogy to this structure but in a much shorter form may be found in 34:8-12. Another possible explanation is that the words of the captain of the guard in vv. 2-3 are to be seen as the word of the LORD to Jeremiah. In this case, it is a rather ironical confirmation of what Jeremiah had been saying all along. If it is thought strange that a pagan soldier would have said these words, it should be remembered that foreign soldiers knew through their intelligence sources what kings and prophets were saying (cf. Isa 36:7), and it is not unusual for God to speak through pagan prophets (cf. Balaam's oracles, e.g. Num 23:7-10) or even a dumb animal (e.g., Balaam's donkey [Num 22:28, 30]). Given the penchant for the use of irony in the book of Jeremiah, this is the most likely explanation. For further discussion on this view see Keown, Scalise, Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i>,<i> </i>pp. 235-36.<br>
 <a name="fn2177" href="jer.htm#fnB2177"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (40:1)  Some commentators see the account of Jeremiah's release here in 40:1-6 as an alternate and contradictory account to that of Jeremiah's release in 39:11-14. However, most commentators see them as complementary and sequential. Jeremiah had been released from the courtyard of the guardhouse on orders of the military tribunal there shortly after Nebuzaradan got to Jerusalem and passed on Nebuchadnezzar's orders to them. He had been released to the custody of Gedaliah who was to take him back to the governor's residence and look after him there. However, Jeremiah remained in Jerusalem among the people there. He was mistakenly rounded up with them and led off as a prisoner to be deported with the rest of the exiles. However, when he got to Ramah which was a staging area for deportees, Nebuzaradan recognized him among the prisoners and released him a second time.<br>
 <a name="fn2178" href="jer.htm#fnB2178"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:1)  <i>Heb</i> "when he took him and he was in chains." The subject is probably Nebuzaradan or the indefinite third singular (GKC &#167;144.<i>d</i>), The Kethib of the word for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yQ!z]aB*</FONT> is to be explained as a secondary formation with prosthetic <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">a</FONT> from the normal word for "fetter" <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qz}</FONT> according to <i>HAL</i> 27 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yQ!z]a&amp;</FONT> (see GKC &#167;19.<i>m</i>; &#167;85.<i>b</i> for the phenomenon).<br>

The meaning of the first part of v. 5 is uncertain. The text is either very cryptic here or is corrupt, perhaps beyond restoration. The Hebrew text reads, "and he was not yet turning and return to Gedaliah" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hy&#180;l=d~G+-la#</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb*v%w+ bWvy&#180;-aO WNd\ouw+</FONT>) which is very cryptic.

The Latin version reads the same as the Hebrew in v. 4 but reads "and don't come with me but stay with Gedaliah" (= a possible Hebrew text of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hy&#180;l=d~G+-ta# hb*v@w+ bWvT* aO yd]M*u!w+</FONT>). The Syriac version reads "But if you are remaining then return to Gedaliah" (reading a possible Hebrew text of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">al% ;d+ouw+</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hy&#180;l=d~G+-la#</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb*v%w+ bv@y{ </FONT>with an abnormal writing of a conditional particle normally written <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wl</FONT> and normally introducing conditions assumed to be untrue or reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hy&#180;l=d~G+-la#</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb*v%w+ bv@y{l= ;d+ouw+</FONT> with an emphatic <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l=</FONT> [see <i>IBHS</i> &#167;11.2.10i, pp. 211-12) and an informally introduced condition [See J. Gibson, <i>Davidson's Introductory Hebrew Grammar-Syntax</i>, &#167;123 and Rem.1 and Isa 6:13 listed there]). NRSV does not explain the Hebrew base for its reading but accepts the Syriac as the original. It does appear to be the most likely alternative if the Hebrew is not accepted. However, the fact that none of the versions agree and all appear to be smoother than the Hebrew text suggests that they were dealing with an awkward original that they were trying to smooth out. Hence it is perhaps best to retain the Hebrew and make the best sense possible out of it. The most common reading of the Hebrew text as it stands is "and while he was not yet turning [= but before he was able to turn (to go)] [Nebuzaradan continued], `Go back to Gedaliah.'" (The imperfect in this case is an imperfect of capability [see <i>IBHS</i> &#167;31.4c examples 2, 4, 5, p. 507].) That is the reading that is adopted here. REB and TEV appear to accept a minor emendation of the verb "turn to leave" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWvy&#180;</FONT>, a Qal imperfect) to "answer" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">byv!y&#180;</FONT>, a Hiphil imperfect with an elided object [see BDB 999 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv</FONT> Hiph 3 and compare 2 Chr 10:16]).

 <a name="fn2192" href="jer.htm#fnB2192"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:8)  Verse 6 consists of a very long conditional clause whose main clause is found in v. 7. The text reads literally "When all the officers of the forces who were in the countryside heard, they and their men, that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah...over the land and that he had committed to him men, women, and children, even from the poorest of the land from those who had not been carried off into exile to Babylon, they came." The sentence has been broken up to better conform with contemporary English style. The phrase "the forces who were in the countryside" has been translated to reflect the probable situation, i.e., they had escaped and were hiding in the hills surrounding Jerusalem waiting for the Babylonians to leave (cf. Judg 6:2).<br>
 <a name="fn2193" href="jer.htm#fnB2193"><sup>18</sup></a><b>sn</b> (40:8)  The name of these officers is given here because some of them become important to the plot of the subsequent narrative, in particular, Ishmael and Johanan. Ishmael was a member of the royal family (41:1). He formed an alliance with the king of Ammon, assassinated Gedaliah, killed the soldiers stationed at Mizpah and many of Gedaliah's followers, and attempted to carry off the rest of the people left at Mizpah to Ammon (40:13; 41:1-3, 10). Johanan was the leading officer who sought to stop Ishmael from killing Gedaliah (40:13-16) and who rescued the Jews that Ishmael was trying to carry off to Ammon (41:11-15). He along with another man named Jezaniah and these other officers were the leaders of the Jews who asked for Jeremiah's advice about what they should do after Ishmael had killed Gedaliah (43:1-7).<br>

The wall was breached in the fourth month (= early July; 39:2) and Nebuzaradan came and burned the palace, the temple, and many of the houses and tore down the wall in the fifth month (= early August; 52:12). That would have left time between the fifth month and the seventh month (October) to gather in the harvest of grapes, dates and figs, and olives (40:12). However, many commentators feel that too much activity takes place in too short a time for this to have been in the same year and posit that it happened the following year or even five years later when a further deportation took place, possibly in retaliation for the murder of Gedaliah and the Babylonian garrison at Mizpah (52:30). The assassination of Gedaliah had momentous consequences and was commemorated in one of the post exilic fast days lamenting the fall of Jerusalem (Zech 8:19).<br>

This can scarcely refer to all the Judeans who had rallied around Gedaliah at Mizpah because v. 10 later speaks of Ishmael carrying off "the rest of the people who were at Mizpah." Probably what is meant is "all the Judeans and Babylonian soldiers" that were also at the meal. It is possible that this meal was intended to seal an agreement between Gedaliah and Ishmael of Ishmael's allegiance to Gedaliah and his Babylonian overlords (cf. Gen 26:30-31; 31:53-54; Exod 24:11). In any case, this act of treachery and deceit was an extreme violation of the customs of hospitality practiced in the ancient Near East.<br>

When Israel was destroyed in 722 B.C., some of the Israelites had been left behind and some of the Judeans had taken up residence in these northern cities. People residing there had participated in the reforms of Hezekiah (2 Chr 30:11) and Josiah (2 Chr 34:9) and were evidently still faithfully following the Jewish calendar. They would have been on their way to Jerusalem to celebrate the Jewish New Year and the Feast of Tabernacles (Lev 23:34).<br>

The meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dy~B=</FONT> does not fit any of the normal ones given for this expression and those who retain the Hebrew text normally explain it as an unparalleled use of "because" or "in the affair of" (so NJPS) or a rare use meaning "near, by the side of " (see BDB 391 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dy&#180;</FONT> 5.d where only Ps 141:6 and Zech 4:12 are cited.

Many commentators relate the second part of the name to the name of the son of David's benefactor when he fled from Absalom (2 Sam 19:38-39) and see this as a reference to an estate that David assigned this son as reward for his father's largess. Gibeon was about six miles northwest of Jerusalem and Benjamin is approximately the same distance southwest of it. Hence, the people mentioned here had not traveled all that far.<br>

The sentence has been broken down and restructured to reflect all the relevant data in shorter sentences which better conform with contemporary English style.

This is a decidedly smoother text but there is no manuscript or versional evidence for it and so it has been rejected here. Some commentators and translations see the words "men of war" ("soldiers") following the word "men" as appositional to that word and hence see only one category. However, there are no parallels to these words used in this kind of apposition. So the translation reflects two categories.<br>

Many think he is also the same man who is named "Azariah" in Jer 43:2 (the Greek version has Azariah both here and in 43:2). It was not uncommon for one man to have two names, e.g., Uzziah who was also named Azariah (compare 2 Kgs 14:21 with 2 Chr 26:1).<br>

The verb is translated "don't seem to want to obey" because they have not yet expressed their refusal or their actual disobedience. Several commentaries sensing this apparent discrepancy suggest that 42:19-22 are to be transposed after 43:1-3 (see e.g., <i>BHS</i> fn 18a, W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 2:275; J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i>, pp. 252, 256, 258). However, there is absolutely no textual evidence for the transposition and little reason to suspect an early scribal error (in spite of Holladay's suggestion). It is possible that Jeremiah here anticipates this answer in 43:1-3 through the response on their faces (so Bright himself, p. 256, F. Huey, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 361. Keown, Scalise, Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i>,<i> </i>p. 249 also call attention to the stated intention in 41:17 and the fact that the strong warning in 42:15-17 seems to imply that a negative response is expected). The use of the perfect here is perhaps to be related to the perfect expressing resolve or determination (see <i>IBHS</i> &#167;30.5.1d, p. 489). It is also conceivable that these two verses are part of a conditional sentence which has no formal introduction. I.e., "And if you will not obey...then you should know for certain that..." For examples of this kind of conditional clause introduced by two <i>vav</i>s see Jo&uuml;on, Muraoka, <i>A Grammar of Biblical Hebrew</i>, &#167;167b, pp. 628-29 and compare Jer 18:4; Judg 6:13. However, though this interpretation is within the possibilities of Hebrew grammar, I know of no translation or commentary that follows it.

This fits the context better but it is difficult to explain how the Hebrew could have arisen from this smoother reading. The figure of substitution (metonymy of cause for effect) is probably involved: "I will have him set" and "I have had you bury." The effect of these substitutions is to emphasize the sovereignty of God.<br>
 <a name="fn2281" href="jer.htm#fnB2281"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (43:10)  The meaning of this word is uncertain. The word here (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">oryr]p=v^</FONT> Qere, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">orWrp=v^</FONT> Kethib) occurs only here in the Hebrew Bible. According to the lexicons it refers to either the carpet for his throne or the canopy over it. See, e.g., <i>HAL</i> 1510 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ryr]p=v^</FONT>.<br>
 <a name="fn2282" href="jer.htm#fnB2282"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (43:11)  As in 15:2 the Hebrew is very brief and staccato-like: "those to death to death, and those to captivity to captivity, and those to the sword to the sword." As in 15:2 most commentaries and translations assume that the word "death" refers to death by disease. See the translator's note on 15:2 and compare also 18:21 where the sword is distinctly connected with "war" or "battle" and is distinct from "killed by death [i.e., disease]."<br>

While it would be possible to explain the first person subject here in the same way as in the two verbs in v. 12b, the corruption of the Hebrew text is easy to explain here as a metathesis of two letters, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">y</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">t</FONT>. The Hebrew reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yT!X^h!</FONT> and the versions presuppose <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tyX!h!</FONT>.<br>

Some of the commentaries and translations make a distinction between the objects of the verbs, i.e., burn the temples and carry off the gods. However, the burning down of the temples is referred to later in v. 13.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (43:12)  It was typical in the ancient Near East for the images of the gods of vanquished nations to be carried off and displayed in triumphal procession on the return from battle to show the superiority of the victor's gods over those of the vanquished (cf., e.g., Isa 46:1-2).<br>

Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 671). The only other passage where that translation is suggested for this verb is Isa 22:17 according to <i>HAL</i>. The alternate translation follows the more normal meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hf*u*</FONT> (cf. BDB 741 s.v. I <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hf*u*</FONT> Qal which explains "so completely will it be in his power"). The fact that the subject is "a shepherd" lends more credence to the former view though there may be a deliberate double meaning playing on the homonyms (cf. W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 2:302).<br>

 <a name="fn2289" href="jer.htm#fnB2289"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (44:1)  The first three cities, <i>Migdol</i>, <i>Tahpanhes</i>, and <i>Memphis</i>, are located in Northern or Lower Egypt. Memphis (Heb "<i>Noph</i>") was located south of Heliopolis (which was referred to earlier as "the temple of the sun") and was about fourteen miles (23 km) south of Cairo. For the identification and location of Tahpanhes see the study note on Jer 43:7. The location of Migdol has been debated but is tentatively identified with a border fortress about twenty-five miles (42 km) east-northeast of Tahpanhes. The "region of southern Egypt" is literally "the land of Pathros," the long Nile valley extending north and south between Cairo and Aswan (biblical Syene). For further information including a map of Northern Egypt see <i>The Illustrated Bible Dictionary</i>, s.v., "Tahpanhes," 3:1515 and also s.v.

 <a name="fn2299" href="jer.htm#fnB2299"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (44:5)  There appears to be a deliberate shift in the pronouns used in vv. 2-5.

"They" refers to the people of Jerusalem and the towns of Judah who have suffered disaster (v. 2) because of the wickedness of sacrificing to other gods (vv. 3, 5).

 <a name="fn2304" href="jer.htm#fnB2304"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (44:8)  Verses 7b-8 are all one long, complex sentence governed by the interrogative "Why." The Hebrew text reads: "Why are you doing great harm to your souls [= "yourselves" (cf. BDB 660 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp#n\</FONT> 4.b[6])] so as to cut off [= destroy] from yourselves man and woman, child and baby [the terms are collective singulars and are to be interpreted as plurals] from the midst of Judah so as not to leave to yourselves a remnant by making me angry with the works of your hands by sacrificing to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have come to live so as to cut off [an example of result rather than purpose after the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/u^m^l=</FONT> (see the translator's note on 25:7)] yourselves and so that you may become a curse and an object of ridicule among all the nations of the earth." The sentence has been broken down and restructured to better conform with contemporary English style. An attempt has been made to retain an equivalent for all the subordinations and qualifying phrases.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (44:8)  What is being threatened is not the total destruction of a remnant of Judah. Jeremiah recognizes those who have been carried off to Babylon as well as other places as seeds for a new beginning (e.g., 24:5-6; 29:14; 30:3). But he denies here that any of those who have gone to Egypt and are continuing to practice idolatry will be among them. All of them will be cut off (i.e., destroyed) from the midst of Judah so that not a remnant of them will be left.<br>
 <a name="fn2305" href="jer.htm#fnB2305"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (44:9)  <i>Heb</i> "his." This should not be viewed as a textual error but as a distributive singular use of the suffix, i.e., the wives of each of the kings of Judah (cf.

 <a name="fn2306" href="jer.htm#fnB2306"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (44:10)  <i>Heb</i> "they" but as H. Freedman, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 284 the third person is used here to include the people just referred to as well as the current addressees. Hence "your people" or "the people of Judah." It is possible that the third person again reflects the rhetorical distancing that was referred to earlier in 35:16 (see the translator's note there for explanation) in which case one might translate "you have shown," and "you have not revered."<br>
 <a name="fn2307" href="jer.htm#fnB2307"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (44:10)  <i>Heb</i> "to set before." According to BDB 817 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hn\P*</FONT> II.4.b(g) this refers to "propounding to someone for acceptance or choice." This is clearly the usage in Deut 30:15, 19; Jer 21:8 and is likely the case here. However, to translate literally would not be good English idiom and "proposed to" might not be correctly understood, so the basic translation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/t^n&#180;</FONT> has been used here.<br>
 <a name="fn2308" href="jer.htm#fnB2308"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (44:11)  <i>Heb</i> "Behold I am setting my face against you for evil/disaster." For the meaning of the idiom "to set the face to/against" see the translator's note on 42:15 and compare the references listed there.<br>
 <a name="fn2309" href="jer.htm#fnB2309"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (44:11)  <i>Heb</i> "and to destroy all Judah." However, this statement must be understood within the rhetoric of the passage (see vv. 7-8 and the study note on v. 8) and within the broader context of the LORD's promises to restore the remnant who are in Babylon and those scattered in other lands (23:3; 24:5-6; 29:14; 30:3; 32:27). In this context "all Judah" must refer to all the Judeans living in Egypt whom Jeremiah is now addressing. This involves the figure of synecdoche where all does not extend to all individuals but to all that are further specified or implied (see E.W. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, pp. 616-18 and the comments in H. Freedman,<i> Jeremiah</i>, p. 285). The "and" in front of "to destroy" is to be understood as an example of the epexegetical use of the conjunction <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">w~</FONT> (see BDB 252 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">w~</FONT> 1.b and compare the translation of J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 260).<br>

 <a name="fn2314" href="jer.htm#fnB2314"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (44:14)  <i>Heb</i> "There shall not be an escapee or a survivor to the remnant of Judah who came to sojourn there in the land of Egypt even to return to the land of Judah which they are lifting up their souls [= "longing/desiring" (BDB 672 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ac*n&#180;</FONT> Piel 2)] to return to live there; for none shall return except fugitives." The long, complex Hebrew original has been broken up and restructured to better conform with contemporary English style. Another possible structure would be "None of the Judean remnant who have come to live in the land of Egypt will escape or survive. None of them will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah where they long to return to live. Indeed (emphatic use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!#</FONT>; cf. BDB 472 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> 1.e) none of them shall return except a few fugitives." This verse is a good example of rhetorical hyperbole where a universal negative does not apply to absolutely all the particulars. Though the LORD denies at the outset that any will escape or survive the punishment of vv. 12-13 to return to Judah, he says at the end that a few fugitives will return (the two words for fugitive are from the same root and mean the same thing). (E. W. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, pp. 618-19 might classify this as a synecdoche of genus where a universal negative does not deny particularity.) That this last statement is not a gloss or an afterthought is supported by what is said later in v. 28.<br>
 <a name="fn2315" href="jer.htm#fnB2315"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (44:15)  The translation is very interpretive at several key points: <i>Heb</i> "Then all the men who were aware that their wives were sacrificing to other gods and all their wives who were standing by, a great crowd/congregation, and all the people who were living in the land of Egypt in Pathros answered, saying." It is proper to assume that the phrase "a great crowd" is appositional to "all the men...and their wives...." It is also probably proper to assume that the phrase "who were standing by" is unnecessary to the English translation. What is interpretive is the assumption that the "and all the people who were living in Egypt in Pathros" is explicative of "the great crowd" and that the phrase "in Pathros" is conjunctive and not appositional. Several commentaries and translations (e.g., J. Thompson,<i> Jeremiah</i>, pp. 678-79 and fn2 and NJPS) assume that the phrase is descriptive of a second group, i.e., all the Jews from Pathros in Egypt (i.e., southern Egypt [see the study note on 44:1]). Those who follow this interpretation generally see this as a gloss (see Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 678, fn 2 and also W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 2:279, fn15b). It is probably better to assume that the phrase is explicative and that "all" is used in the same rhetorical way that it has been used within the chapter, i.e., "all" = representatives of all. Likewise the phrase "in Pathros" should be assumed to be conjunctive as in the Syriac translation and as suggested by <i>BHS</i> fn c since Jeremiah's answer in vv. 24, 26 is directed to all the Judeans living in Egypt.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (44:18)  What is being contrasted here is the relative peace and prosperity under the reign of Manasseh, who promoted all kinds of pagan cults including the worship of astral deities (2 Kgs 21:2-9), and the disasters that befell Judah after the reforms of Josiah, which included the removal of all the cult images and altars from Jerusalem and Judah (2 Kgs 23:4-15). The disasters included the death of Josiah himself at the battle of Megiddo, the deportation of his son Jehoahaz to Egypt, the death of Jehoiakim, the deportation of Jehoiachin (Jeconia) and many other Judeans in 597 B.C., the death by war, starvation, and disease of many Judeans during the siege of Jerusalem in 588-86 B.C., and the captivity of many of those who survived. Instead of seeing these as punishments for their disobedience to the LORD as Jeremiah had preached to them, they saw these as consequences of their failure to continue the worship of the foreign gods.<br>
 <a name="fn2321" href="jer.htm#fnB2321"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tc</b> (44:19)  The words "And the women added" are not in the Hebrew text. They are, however, implicit in what is said. They are found in the Syriac version and in one recension of the Greek version. W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 2:279, fn19a suggests that these words are missing from the Hebrew text because of haplography, i.e., that the scribe left out <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk! Wrm=a* &lt;yv!N&#180;hw~^</FONT> because his eye jumped from the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">w~</FONT> at the beginning to the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> that introduced the temporal clause and left out everything in between. It is, however, just as likely, given the fact that there are several other examples of quotes which have not been formally introduced in the book of Jeremiah, that the words were not there and are supplied by these two translations as a translator's clarification.<br>

The question expects a positive answer and has been rendered as an affirmation in the translation. The long, complex Hebrew sentence has again been broken in two and restructured to better conform with contemporary English style.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (44:19)  According to Jer 7:18-19 it was not only with the full knowledge and approval of their husbands but also with their active participation. Most of the commentaries call attention to the fact that what is being alluded to here is that a woman's vow had to have her husband's conscious approval to have any validity (cf.

 <a name="fn2329" href="jer.htm#fnB2329"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (44:25)  Or "You and your wives." The text and referent here is uncertain because of the confusing picture that the alternation of pronouns presents in this verse. Three of the main verbs are second feminine plurals and one of them is second masculine plural. All the pronominal suffixes on the nouns are second masculine plurals. The Hebrew text reads: "You [masc. pl.] and your [masc. pl.] wives have spoken [2nd fem. pl.; <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hn&#180;r+B@d~T=</FONT>] with your [masc. pl.] mouth and you have fulfilled [masc. pl.; <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;t#aL@m!</FONT>] with your [masc. pl.] hands, saying, `We [common gender] will certainly carry out....' Indeed fulfill [2nd fem. pl.; <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hn&#180;m=yq!T*</FONT>] your [masc. pl.] vows and indeed carry out [2nd fem. pl.; <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hn&#180;yc#u&amp;t^</FONT>] your [masc. pl.] vows." Older commentaries such as C.F. Keil, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 2:165 explain the feminine verbs as a matter of the women being the principle subject. Most all modern commentaries (e.g., J. A. Thompson, J. Bright, W. Holladay, and Keown, Scalise, Smothers) follow the reading of the Greek version which reads "you women" (=<i> </i><FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yV!N&#180;h^ hn&#180;T@a^</FONT>) in place of "you and your wives" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;k#yv@n+W &lt;T#a^</FONT>) in the Hebrew. None of them, however, explain the use of the 2nd masc. plurals here. This is possibly a case where the masculine forms are used in the place of the feminine due to the dislike of Hebrew to use the feminine plural forms (cf. GKC &#167;144.<i>a</i>; &#167;145.<i>t</i>). This seems all the more probable when 2nd fem. pl. verbs are qualified by nouns with 2nd masc. pl. suffixes. The translation here follows this interpretation of the masc. pl. forms and reads "you women" with the Greek version in place of "you and your wives" and sees the referents throughout as the women.<br>

The term "survivors of the sword" may be intended to represent both those who survive death in war or death by starvation or disease, a synecdoche of species for all three genera.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (44:28)  This statement shows that the preceding "none," "never again," "all" in vv. 26-27 are rhetorical hyperbole. Not all but almost all; very few would survive. The following statement implies that the reason that they are left alive is to bear witness to the fact that the LORD's threats were indeed carried out.

The word "sign" refers to an event that is a pre-omen or portent of something that will happen later (see BDB 16 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toa</FONT> 2 and compare usage in 1 Sam 14:10; 2 Kgs 19:29). The best way to carry that idea across in this context seems to be "I will make something happen to prove [or, portend]." Another possibility would be "I will give you a pre-omen that," but many readers would probably not be familiar with "omen/ pre-omen."

Perhaps from the reactions of Baruch this refers to the second scroll which was written after he had seen how the leaders had responded to the first (36:19). Baruch was from a well-placed family; his grandfather, Mahseiah (32:12) had been governor of Jerusalem under Josiah (2 Chr 34:8) and his brother was a high-ranking official in Zedekiah's court (Jer 51:59). He himself appears to have had some personal aspirations that he could see were being or going to be jeopardized (v. 5). The passage is both a rebuke to Baruch and an encouragement that his life will be spared wherever he goes. This latter promise is perhaps the reason that the passage is placed where it is, i.e., after the seemingly universal threat of destruction of all who have gone to Egypt in Jer 44.<br>

The reference here to universal judgment also forms a nice transition to the judgments on the nations that follow in Jer 46-51 which may be another reason for the placement of this chapter here, out of its normal chronological order (see also the study note on v. 1).<br>

The prophecies or oracles that are collected here in Jer 46-51 are found after 25:13a in the Greek version where they are also found in a different order and with several textual differences. The issue of which represents the original placement is part of the broader issue of the editorial or redactional history of the book of Jeremiah which went through several editions, two of which are referred to in Jer 36, i.e., the two scrolls written in the fourth year of Jehoiakim (605 B.C.), a third which included all the preceding plus the material down to the time of the fall of Jerusalem (cf. the introduction in 1:1-3) and a fourth that included all the preceding plus the materials in Jer 40-44. The oracles against the foreign nations collected here are consistent with the note of judgment sounded against all nations (including some not mentioned in Jer 46-51) in Jer 25. See the translator's note on 25:13 for further details regarding the possible relationship of the oracles to the foreign nations to the judgment speeches in Jer 25.<br>

 <a name="fn2353" href="jer.htm#fnB2353"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (46:2)  The fourth year of Jehoiakim's reign proved very significant in the prophecies of Jeremiah. It was in that same year that he issued the prophecies against the foreign nations recorded in Jer 25 (and probably the prophecies recorded here in Jer 46-51) and that he had Baruch record and read to the people gathered in the temple all the prophecies he had uttered against Judah and Jerusalem up to that point in the hopes that they would repent and the nation would be spared. The fourth year of Jehoiakim (605 B.C.) marked a significant shift in the balance of power in Palestine. With the defeat of Necho at Carchemish in that year the area came under the control of Nebuchadnezzar and Judah and the surrounding nations had two options, submit to Babylon and pay tribute or suffer the consequences of death in war or exile in Babylon for failure to submit.<br>

The sentence has been broken up, restructured, and introductory words supplied in the translation to make the sentences better conform with contemporary English style. The dating formula is placed in brackets because the passage is prophetic about the battle, but the bracketed words were superscription or introduction and thus were added after the outcome was known.<br>
 <a name="fn2355" href="jer.htm#fnB2355"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:3)  This is often translated "prepare your shields, both small and large." However, the idea of "prepare" is misleading because the Hebrew word here (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Er~u*</FONT>) refers in various senses to arranging or setting things in order, such as altars in a row, dishes on a table, soldiers in ranks. Here it refers to the soldiers lining up in rank with ranks of soldiers holding at the ready the long oval or rectangular "shield" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hN&#180;x!</FONT>, cf. BDB 857 s.v. III <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hN&#180;x!</FONT>) which protected the whole body and the smaller round "buckler" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/g}m*</FONT>) which only protected the torso (the relative size of these two kinds of shields can be seen from the weight of each in 1 Kgs 10:16-17). These were to be arranged in solid ranks to advance into battle. It would be pedantic and misleading to translate here "Fall into ranks with your large and small shields at the ready" because that might suggest that soldiers had more than one kind. It is uncertain who is issuing the commands here. TEV adds "The Egyptian officers shout," which is the interpretation of J. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 688. The <i>NIV Study Bible</i> fn on p. 1196 suggests that these are the words of the LORD spoken in sarcasm and compares Nah 2:1; 3:4. The latter interpretation is more likely in the light of the similar structure in v. 9 where the connection between v. 9 and v. 10 is stronger than the connection between v. 8 and v. 9.<br>

 <a name="fn2368" href="jer.htm#fnB2368"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:10)  Or more paraphrastically, "he will kill them/ until he has exacted full vengeance"; <i>Heb</i> "The sword will eat and be sated; it will drink its fill of their blood."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (46:10)  This passage is, of course, highly figurative. The LORD does not have a literal "sword," but he uses agents of destruction like the Assyrian armies (called his "rod" in Isa 10:5-6) and the Babylonian armies (called his war club in Jer 51:20) to wreak vengeance on his foes. Likewise, swords do not "eat" or "drink." What is meant here is that God will use this battle against the Egyptians to kill off many Egyptians until his vengeance is fully satisfied.<br>

The use of the figure here perhaps refers to the fact that Egypt's geographical isolation allowed her safety and protection that a virgin living at home would enjoy under her father's protection (so F. B. Huey, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 379). By her involvement in the politics of Palestine she had forfeited that safety and protection and was now suffering for it.<br>

The verbs in this verse are all in the tense that emphasizes that the action is viewed as already having been accomplished (i.e., the Hebrew prophetic perfect). This is consistent with the <i>vav</i> consecutive perfects in v. 10 which look to the future.<br>
 <a name="fn2375" href="jer.htm#fnB2375"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:13)  <i>Heb</i> "The word which the LORD spoke to the prophet Jeremiah about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to attack the land of Egypt."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (46:13)  Though there is much debate in the commentaries regarding the dating and reference of this prophecy, it most likely refers to a time shortly after 604 B.C. when Nebuchadnezzar followed up his successful battle against Necho at Carchemish with a campaign into the Philistine plain which resulted in the conquest and sacking of Ashkelon. Nebuchadnezzar now stood poised on the border of Egypt to invade it. See J. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 691 and for a fuller discussion including the other main options see Keown, Scalise, Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i>,<i> </i>pp. 287-88.<br>

The sentence has been restructured to reflect the fact that the first command is a general one, followed by announcements in specific (representative?) cities.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (46:14)  For the location of the cities of Migdol, Memphis, and Tahpanhes see the note on Jer 44:1. These were all cities in Lower or northern Egypt that would have been the first affected by an invasion.<br>

Here it is a reference to the forces of Nebuchadnezzar which have already destroyed the Egyptian forces at Carchemish and have made victorious forays into the Philistine plain.<br>
 <a name="fn2378" href="jer.htm#fnB2378"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:15)  The word translated "soldiers" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yr]yB!a^</FONT>) is not the Hebrew word that has been used of soldiers elsewhere in these oracles (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yr]oBG]</FONT>). It is an adjective used as a noun that can apply to animals, i.e., of a bull (Ps 50:13) or a stallion (Judg 5:22). Moreover, the form is masculine plural and the verbs are singular. Hence, many modern commentaries and translations follow the redivision of the first line presupposed by the Greek version, "Apis has fled" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[j^ sn&#180;</FONT>) and see this as a reference to the bull god of Memphis. However, the noun is used of soldiers in Lam 1:15 and the plural could be the distributive plural, i.e., each and every one (cf. GKC &#167;145.<i>l</i> and compare usage in Gen 27:29).<br>
 <a name="fn2379" href="jer.htm#fnB2379"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:15)  The Hebrew word used here only occurs here (in the Niphal) and in Prov 28:3 (in the Qal) where it refers to a rain that beats down grain. That idea would fit nicely with the idea of the soldiers being beaten down, or defeated. It is possible that the rarity of this verb (versus the common verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">sWn</FONT> "flee") and the ready identification of Apis with the bull calf (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ryB!a^</FONT>) has led to the reading of the Greek text (so von Orelli, <i>The Prophecies of Jeremiah</i>, p. 327). The verbs in this verse and the following are in the perfect tense but should be understood as prophetic perfects since the text is dealing with what will happen when Nebuchadnezzar comes into Egypt. The text of vv. 18-24 shows a greater mixture with some perfects and some imperfects, sometimes even within the same verse (e.g., v. 22).<br>
 <a name="fn2380" href="jer.htm#fnB2380"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:15)  <i>Heb</i> "the LORD will thrust them down." However, the LORD is speaking (cf. clearly in v. 18), so the first person is adopted for the sake of consistency. This has been a consistent problem in the book of Jeremiah where the prophet is so identified with the word of the LORD that he sometimes uses the first person and sometimes the third. It creates confusion for the average reader who is trying to follow the flow of the argument and has been shifted to the first person like this on a number of occasions. TEV and CEV have generally adopted the same policy as have some other modern translations at various points.<br>
 <a name="fn2381" href="jer.htm#fnB2381"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:16)  <i>Heb</i> "he multiplied the one stumbling." For the first person reference see the preceding translator's note.<br>
 <a name="fn2382" href="jer.htm#fnB2382"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tc</b> (46:16)  The words "in their hurry to get away" are not in the text but appear to be necessary to clarify the point that the stumbling and falling here is not the same as that in vv. 6, 12 where they occur in the context of defeat and destruction. Reference here appears to be to the mercenary soldiers who in their hurried flight to escape stumble over one another and fall. This is fairly clear from the literal translation "he multiplies the stumbling one. Also [= and] a man falls against a man and they say [probably = "saying"; an epexegetical use of the <i>vav</i> consecutive (<i>IBHS</i> &#167;33.2.2b, p. 551, and see Exod 2:10 as a parallel)] `Get up! Let's go...'" A reference to the flight of the mercenaries is also seen in v. 21. Many of the modern commentaries and a few of the modern translations follow the Greek text and read vv. 15a-16 very differently. The Greek reads "Why has Apis fled from you? Your choice calf [i.e., Apis] has not remained. For the Lord has paralyzed him. And your multitudes have fainted and fallen; and each one said to his neighbor,..." (reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Whu@r}-la# vya! Wrm=aY{w~ lp^n&#180;-&lt;G~ lv^K* ;B=r%</FONT> instead of<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> Whu@r}-la# vya! lp^n&#180;-&lt;G~ hB*r+h! lv@oK</FONT>). One would expect <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Whu@r}-la# vya!</FONT> to go with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wrm=aY{w~ </FONT>because it is idiomatic in this expression (cf., e.g., Gen 11:3; Judg 6:29). However, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Whu@r}-la# vya!</FONT> is also found with singular verbs as here in Exod 22:9; 33:11; 1 Sam 10:11. There is no doubt that the Hebrew text is the more difficult and thus probably original. The reading of the Greek version is not supported by any other text or version and looks like an attempt to smooth out a somewhat awkward Hebrew original.<br>
 <a name="fn2383" href="jer.htm#fnB2383"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:16)  <i>Heb</i> "to our native lands from before the sword of the oppressor." The compound preposition "from before" is regularly used in a causal sense (see BDB 818 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hn\P*</FONT> 6.a, b, c). The "sword" is again interpreted as a figure for the destructive power of an enemy army.<br>
 <a name="fn2384" href="jer.htm#fnB2384"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:17)  <i>Heb</i> "is a noise." The addition of "just a big" is contextually motivated and is supplied in the translation to suggest the idea of sarcasm. The reference is probably to his boast in v. 8.<br>

It is unclear what is meant by the reference to "appointed time" other than the fact that Pharaoh has missed his opportunity to do what he claimed to be able to do. The Greek text is again different here. It reads "Call the name of Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt Saon esbeie moed," reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v@ War+q!</FONT> for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v* War+q*</FONT> and transliterating the last line.<br>

The addition of "conqueror" and "imposing" are implicit from the context and from the metaphor. They have been supplied in the translation to give the reader some idea of the meaning of the verse.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (46:18)  Most of the commentaries point out that neither Tabor nor Carmel are all that tall in terms of sheer height. Mount Tabor, on the east end of the Jezreel Valley, is only about 1800 feet (540 m) tall. Mount Carmel, on the Mediterranean Coast, is only about 1700 feet (510 m) at its highest. However, all the commentators point out that the idea of imposing height and majesty are due to the fact that they are rugged mountains that stand out dominantly over their surroundings. The point of the simile is that Nebuchadnezzar and his army will stand out in power and might over all the surrounding kings and their armies.<br>
 <a name="fn2389" href="jer.htm#fnB2389"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:19)  <i>Heb</i> "inhabitants of daughter Egypt." Like the phrase "daughter Zion," "daughter Egypt" is a poetic personification of the land, here perhaps to stress the idea of defenselessness.<br>

A gadfly from the north will come against her."<br>The metaphors have been turned into similes for the sake of clarity. The exact meaning of the word translated "stinging fly" is uncertain due to the fact that it occurs nowhere else in Hebrew literature. For a discussion of the meaning of the word which probably refers to the "gadfly," which bites and annoys livestock, see W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 2:331 who also suggests, probably correctly, that the word is a collective referring to swarms of such insects (cf. the singular <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hB#r+a^</FONT> in v. 23 which always refers to swarms of locusts). The translation presupposes the emendation of the second <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aB*</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">HB*</FONT> with a number of Hebrew MSS and a number of the versions (cf. <i>BHS</i>, fn b).<br>
 <a name="fn2392" href="jer.htm#fnB2392"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:21)  <i>Heb</i> "her hirelings in her midst."<br>

The mercenaries were well cared for like stall-fed calves, but in the face of the danger they will prove no help because they will turn and run away without standing their ground. Some see the point of the simile to be that they too are fattened for slaughter. However, the next two lines do not fit that interpretation too well.<br>
 <a name="fn2394" href="jer.htm#fnB2394"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:21)  The temporal use of the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> (BDB 472 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> 2.a) seems more appropriate to the context than the causal use.<br>

The meaning of the simile is debated. Some see a reference to the impotent hiss of a fleeing serpent (F. B. Huey, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 382), others the sound of a serpent stealthily crawling away when it is disturbed (H. Freedman, <i>Jeremiah</i>, pp. 297-98). The translation follows the former interpretation because of the irony involved.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (46:22)  Several commentators point out the irony of the snake slithering away (or hissing away) in retreat. The coiled serpent was a part of the royal insignia, signifying its readiness to strike. Pharaoh had boasted of great things (v. 8) but was just a big noise (v. 17); now all he could do was hiss as he beat his retreat (v. 22).<br>
 <a name="fn2396" href="jer.htm#fnB2396"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:23)  <i>Heb</i> "Oracle of the LORD." Again the first person is adopted because the LORD is speaking and the indirect quotation is used to avoid an embedded quotation with quotation marks on either side.<br>
 <a name="fn2397" href="jer.htm#fnB2397"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:23)  The precise meaning of this verse is uncertain. The Hebrew text reads: "They [those who enter in great force] will cut down her forest, oracle of the LORD, though it [the forest] cannot be searched out/through for they [those who come in great force] are more numerous than locusts and there is no number to them." Some see the reference to the forest as metaphorical of Egypt's population which the Babylonian army decimates (H. Freedman, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 298, and see BDB 420 s.v. I <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ru^y~</FONT> 1.a which refers to the forest as a figure of foes to be cut down and destroyed and compare Isa 10:34). Others see the reference to literal trees and see the decimation of Egypt in general (von Orelli, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 329). And some see it as a continuation of the simile of the snake fleeing, the soldiers cutting down the trees because they cannot find it (J. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 693). However, the simile of v. 22a has already been dropped in v. 22b-d; they come against her. Hence it is probably best to see this as a continuation of the simile in v. 22c-d and see the reference to the Babylonian army coming against her, i.e., Egypt (the nation or people of Egypt), like woodcutters cutting down trees.<br>

Several proposals have been suggested, the most likely of which is that the prophecy was delivered in 609 B.C. in conjunction with Pharaoh Necho's advance into Palestine to aid the Assyrians. That was the same year that Josiah was killed by Necho at the battle of Megiddo and four years before Necho was defeated by Nebuchadnezzar, the foe from the north. The prophecy presupposes that Ashkelon is still in existence (v. 5) hence it must be before 604 B.C.

"Crete" is literally "Caphtor" which is generally identified with the island of Crete. The Philistines had come from there (Amos 9:7) in the wave of migration from the Aegean Islands during the twelfth and eleventh century and had settled on the Philistine plain after having been repulsed from trying to enter Egypt.<br>

It is a rare homonym of the word that normally means "valley" that seems to be an inappropriate designation of the Philistine plain.

This emendation is followed by both BDB 771 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qm#u@</FONT> and KBL 716 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qm#u@</FONT>. The Anakim were generally associated with the southern region around Hebron but an enclave of them was known to have settled in Gaza, Gath, and Ekron, three of the Philistine cities (cf. Josh 11:22). However, the fact that this judgment is directed against the Philistines not the Anakim and that this homonym apparently appears also in Jer 49:4 makes the reading of "power" more likely here.<br>

 <a name="fn2423" href="jer.htm#fnB2423"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (48:1)  <i>Moab</i> was a country east of the Dead Sea whose boundaries varied greatly over time. Basically, it was the tableland between the Arnon River about halfway up the Dead Sea and the Zered River which is roughly at the southern tip of the Dead Sea. When the Israelites entered Palestine they were forbidden to take any of the Moabite territory but they did capture the kingdom of Sihon north of the Arnon which Sihon had taken from Moab. Several of the towns mentioned in the oracles of judgment against Moab here are in this territory north of the Arnon and were assigned to Reuben and Gad. Several are mentioned on the famous Moabite Stone which details how Mesha king of Moab recovered from Israel many of these cities during the reign of Joram (852-841 B.C.; cf. 2 Kgs 3:4-5). It is usually assumed that Moab submitted to Nebuchadnezzar after the battle of Carchemish and that they remained loyal to him throughout most of this period, though representatives were present at Jerusalem in 594 B.C. when plans for revolt were apparently being discussed (Jer 27:3). Moabite contingents were used by Nebuchadnezzar in 598 B.C. to harass Jehoiakim after he rebelled (2 Kgs 24:2) so they must have remained loyal at that time. According to the Jewish historian Josephus, Nebuchadnezzar conquered Moab in 582 B.C. and destroyed many of its cities. For further discussion on Moab and maps of known places including those mentioned in the Moabite stone, see <i>The Illustrated Bible Dictionary</i>, s.v. "Moab," 2:1014-16.<br>
 <a name="fn2424" href="jer.htm#fnB2424"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (48:1)  <i>Heb</i> "Woe to Nebo for it is destroyed." For the use of the Hebrew particle "Woe" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yoh</FONT>) see the translator's note on 22:13. The translation has taken this form because the phrase "Woe to" probably doesn't convey the proper meaning or significance to the modern reader. The verbs again are in the tense (Hebrew prophetic perfect) that views the action as if it were as good as done. The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> probably is causal but the asseverative works better in the modified translation.<br>
 <a name="fn2425" href="jer.htm#fnB2425"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (48:1)  <i>Nebo</i> and <i>Kiriathaim</i> were both north of the Arnon and were assigned to Reuben (Num 32:3, Josh 13:19). They are both mentioned on the Moabite Stone as having been recovered from Israel.<br>
 <a name="fn2426" href="jer.htm#fnB2426"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (48:1)  Or "Misgab." The translation here follows the majority of commentaries and translations. Only REB sees this as a place name, "Misgab," which is otherwise unknown. The constant use of this word to refer to a fortress, the presence of the article on the front of it, and the lack of any reference to a place of this name anywhere else argues against it being a place name. However, the fact that the verbs that accompany it are feminine while the noun for "fortress" is masculine causes some pause.<br>
 <a name="fn2427" href="jer.htm#fnB2427"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (48:1)  For the meaning of the verb here see BDB 369 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tt^j*</FONT> Qal 1 and compare usage in Isa 7:8; 30:31.<br>

It was captured from Sihon and originally assigned to the tribe of Reuben (Num 32:37; Josh 13:17). Later it was made a levitical city and was assigned to the tribe of Gad (Josh 21:39). It formed the northern limits of Moab. It was located about eighteen miles east of the northern tip of the Dead Sea.<br>
 <a name="fn2429" href="jer.htm#fnB2429"><sup>8</sup></a><b>sn</b> (48:2)  There is a wordplay in Hebrew on the word "Heshbon" and the word "plot" (<i>hashab</i>).<br>

The "they" is undefined, but it would scarcely be Moabites living in Heshbon. Hence TEV and CEV are probably correct in seeing a reference to the enemy which would imply the conquest of this city which lay on the northern border of Moab.<br>
 <a name="fn2431" href="jer.htm#fnB2431"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (48:2)  The meaning of this line is somewhat uncertain. The translation here follows all the modern translations and commentaries in reading the place name "Madmen" even though the place is otherwise unknown and the Greek, Syriac, and Latin version all read this word as an emphasizing infinitive absolute of the following verb "will be destroyed," i.e. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WMD)y] &lt;omD&#180;</FONT>. Some see this word as a variant of the name Dimon in Isa 15:9 which in turn is a playful variant of the place name Dibon. There is once again a wordplay on the word "Madmen" and "will be destroyed"; <i>madmen</i> and <i>yiddommu</i>. For the meaning of the verb = "perish" or "be destroyed" see Jer 8:14; Psa 31:18.<br>
 <a name="fn2432" href="jer.htm#fnB2432"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (48:2)  <i>Heb</i> "A sword will follow after you." The sword is again figurative of destructive forces, here the army of the Babylonians.<br>
 <a name="fn2433" href="jer.htm#fnB2433"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tc</b> (48:4)  The reading here follows the Qere <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">h*yr\yu!x=</FONT> which is the same noun found in Jer 14:3 in the sense of "servants." Here it refers to the young ones, i.e., the children (cf. the use of the adjective BDB 859 s.v. I <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ryu!x*</FONT> 2 and see Gen 43:33). Many of the modern commentaries and a few of the modern translations follow the Greek version and read "their cry is heard as far as Zoar" (reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hr&#180;u&amp;x)</FONT>; see for example J. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 699, fn4 and BDB 858 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ru^x)</FONT>). However, that leaves the verb with an indefinite subject (the verb is active 3rd plural not passive) not otherwise identified in the preceding context. Many of the modern translations such as NRSV, NJPS, NIV retain the Hebrew as the present translation has done. In this case the masculine plural noun furnishes a logical subject for the verb.<br>
 <a name="fn2434" href="jer.htm#fnB2434"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (48:5)  Or "Indeed her fugitives will..." It is unclear what the subject of the verbs are in this verse. The verb in the first two lines "climb" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hl#u&amp;y~</FONT>) is third masculine singular and the verb in the second two lines "will hear" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wum=v*</FONT>) is third common plural. The causal particles at the beginning of the two halves of the verse suggest some connection with the preceding, so the translation assumes that the children are still the subject. In this case the singular verb would be a case of the distributive singular already referred to in the translator's note on 46:15. The parallel passage in Isa 15:5 refers to the "fugitives" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">h*j#yr]B=</FONT>) with the same singular verb as here and that may be the implied subject here.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (48:5)  The location of <i>Luhith</i> and <i>Horonaim</i> are uncertain, though, from their connection with Zoar in Isa 15:5, they appear to be located in southern Moab. Zoar was at the southern tip of the Dead Sea.<br>
 <a name="fn2435" href="jer.htm#fnB2435"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (48:5)  <i>Heb</i> "the distresses of the cry of destruction." Many commentaries want to leave out the word "distresses" because it is missing from the Greek version and the parallel passage in Isa 15:5. However, it is in all the Hebrew MSS and in the other early versions, and it is hard to see why it would be added here if it were not original.<br>
 <a name="fn2436" href="jer.htm#fnB2436"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tc</b> (48:6)  The meaning of this line is uncertain. The translation follows one reading of the Hebrew text. The Greek version reads "Be like a wild donkey in the desert!" There are three points of debate in this line: the syntax of the verb form "be" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hn&#180;yy\h=t!</FONT>) and the text and meaning of the word translated "shrub" in the Hebrew text. This word only occurs with this meaning here and in Jer 17:6. A related word occurs in Ps 102:17 (102:18 HT). Elsewhere this spelling refers to the place name Aroer which was a place in Moab on the edge of the Arnon River. Most commentators do not feel that a reference to that place is appropriate here because it was not in the desert. The Greek version reads "like a wild donkey" (reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">doru*K=</FONT> in place of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ru@oru&amp;K^</FONT>). That would make an appropriate simile here because the wild donkey enjoys its freedom and is hard to capture. Keown, Scalise, Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i>,<i> </i>p. 312 explain the simile of the "shrub" as referring to the marginal and rudimentary existence of a displaced person. That may not be as optimistic as the reference to the wild donkey but it does give an appropriate meaning. The third feminine plural has been explained as the singular noun + suffix = "yourselves" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;k#v=p=n~</FONT>) used as a collective (so S. R. Driver, <i>The Book of the Prophet Jeremiah</i>, p. 368 with cross reference to GKC &#167;145.<i>c</i>). J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>, p. 314, fn e-e, follows a suggestion of D. N. Freedman in seeing the form (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hn&#180;yy\h=t!</FONT>) as a mistake for the 2nd masculine plural plus energic (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/Wyh=t!</FONT>). Given the number of other textual corruptions in this passage, this is possible. The resultant meaning in either case is the same.<br>
 <a name="fn2437" href="jer.htm#fnB2437"><sup>16</sup></a><b>sn</b> (48:7)  <i>Chemosh</i> was the national god of Moab (see also Numb 21:29). Child sacrifice appears to have been a part of his worship (2 Kgs 3:27). Solomon built a high place in Jerusalem for him (1 Kgs 11:7), and he appears to have been worshiped in Israel until Josiah tore that high place down (2 Kgs 23:13).<br>
 <a name="fn2438" href="jer.htm#fnB2438"><sup>17</sup></a><b>sn</b> (48:7)  The practice of carrying off the gods of captive nations has already been mentioned in the study note on 43:12. See also Isa 46:1-2 noted there.<br>
 <a name="fn2439" href="jer.htm#fnB2439"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (48:8)  <i>Heb</i> "The valley will be destroyed and the tableland be laid waste." However, in the context this surely refers to the towns and not to the valley and the tableland itself.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (48:8)  Most commentaries see a reference to the towns in the Jordan valley referred to in Josh 13:27 and the towns mentioned in Josh 13:15-17 which were on the high tableland or high plateau or plain north of the Arnon. The mention of the towns in the first half of the verse is broader than that because it would include all the towns in the southern half of Moab between the Arnon and Zered as well as those mentioned in the second half in conjunction with the valley and the high plateau north of the Arnon.<br>
 <a name="fn2440" href="jer.htm#fnB2440"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (48:8)  <i>Heb</i> "which/for/as the LORD has spoken." The first person form has again been adopted because the LORD is the speaker throughout (cf. v. 1).<br>
 <a name="fn2441" href="jer.htm#fnB2441"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (48:9)  Or "Scatter salt over Moab for it will certainly be laid in ruins." The meaning of these two lines is very uncertain. The Hebrew of these two lines presents several difficulties. It reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ax@T@ ax)n&#180; ba*oml= Jyx!-WnT=</FONT>. Of the five words two are extremely problematic and the meaning of the second affects also the meaning of the last word which normally means "go out." The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jyx!</FONT> regularly refers to a blossom or flower or the diadem on the front of Aaron's mitre. BDB 851 s.v. II <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jyx!</FONT> gives a nuance "wings (coll)" based on the interpretation of Abu Walid and some medieval Jewish interpreters who related it to an Aramaic root. But BDB says that meaning is dubious and refers to the Greek which reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">shmeia</FONT> "sign" or "sign post." Along with KBL 802 s.v. I <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jyx!</FONT> and <i>HAL</i> 959 s.v. II <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jyx!</FONT>, BDB suggests that the Greek presupposes the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/WYx!</FONT> which refers to a road marker (Jer 31:21) or a gravestone (2 Kgs 23:17). That is the meaning followed here. Several modern commentaries and translations have followed a proposal by W. Moran that the word is related to a Ugaritic word meaning salt (cf., e.g., J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 320). However, <i>HAL</i> 959 s.v. II <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jyx!</FONT> questions the validity of this on philological grounds saying that the meaning of salt doesn't really fit the Ugaritic either. The present translation follows the suggestions of the lexicons here and reads the word as though the Greek supported the meaning "gravestone." The other difficulty is with the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ax)n&#180;</FONT>, which looks like a Qal infinitive absolute of an otherwise unattested root which BDB s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ax*n&#180;</FONT> says is defined in Gesenius's Thesaurus as "fly." However, see the meaning and the construction of an infinitive absolute of one root with that of another as highly improbable. Hence, most modern lexicons either emend the forms to read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hX#T! hx)n&#180;</FONT> from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hx*n&#180;</FONT> meaning "to fall into ruins" (so KBL 629 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hx*n&#180;</FONT> Qal, and see among others J. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 700, fn 10 who notes that final <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">a</FONT> and final <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">h</FONT> are often confused; see the discussion and examples in GKC &#167;75.<i>nn</i>-<i>rr</i>). This is the option that this translation as well as a number of modern ones have taken. A second option is to see <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ax)n&#180;</FONT> as an error for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ax)y&#180;</FONT> and read the text in the sense of "she will certainly surrender," a meaning that the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ax*y&#180;</FONT> has in 1 Sam 11:3; Isa 36:6. The best discussion of this option as well as a discussion on the problem of reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jyx! </FONT>as salt is found in Keown, Scalise, Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i>,<i> </i>pp. 313-14.<br>

The verse continues the metaphor from the preceding verse where Moab/the people of Moab are like wine left undisturbed in a jar, i.e., in their native land. In this verse the picture is that of the decanter emptying the wine from the vessels and then breaking the jars. The wine represents the people and the vessels the cities and towns where the people lived. The verse speaks of the exile of the people and the devastation of the land.

"Bethel [Deity]," 1:390 for the arguments). However, there is no evidence in the OT that such a god was worshiped in Israel, and there is legitimate evidence that northern Israel placed its confidence in the calf god that Jeroboam set up in Bethel (cf. 1 Kgs 12:28-32; Hos 10:5; 8:5-6; Amos 7:10-17).<br>

Since the first person singular is used in the next verse, the present translation considers the "we" of this verse to refer to the plural of majesty or the plural referring to the divine council in such passages as Gen 1:26; 3:22; 11:7; Isa 6:8 and has translated in the singular to avoid possible confusion of who the "we" are.

 <a name="fn2466" href="jer.htm#fnB2466"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (48:30)  The meaning of this verse is somewhat uncertain: <i>Heb</i> "I know, oracle of the LORD,/ his arrogance and [that it is?] not true; // his boastings accomplish that which is not true." Several of the modern translations and commentaries redivide the verse and read something like, "I know his insolence...his boastings are false; his deeds are false (NRSV, REB)." However, the word translated "deeds" in the last line is a verb in the third person plural and can only have as its logical grammatical subject the word "boastings." The adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/K@</FONT> + the negative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aO</FONT> is evidently repeated here and applied to two different subjects "arrogance" and "boasting" to emphasize that Moab's arrogant boasts will prove "untrue" (Cf. <i>HAL</i> 459 s.v. II <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/K@</FONT> 2.c for the meaning "untrue" for both this passage and the parallel one in Isa 16:6). There is some difference of opinion about the identification of the "I" in this verse. Most commentators see it as referring to the prophet. However, F. B. Huey, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 395 is probably correct in seeing it as referring to the LORD. He points to the fact that the "I" in vv. 33, 35, 38 can only refer to God. The "I know" in v. 30 also clearly has the LORD as its subject. There are other cases in the book of Jeremiah where the LORD expresses his lament over the fate of a people (cf. 14:1-6, 17-18).<br>
 <a name="fn2467" href="jer.htm#fnB2467"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tc</b> (48:31)  The translation is based on the emendation of the Hebrew third masculine singular (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hG\h=y\</FONT>) to the first singular (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hG\h=a#</FONT>). This emendation is assumed by almost all of the modern translations and commentaries even though the textual evidence for it is weak (only one Hebrew MS and the Eastern Qere according to <i>BHS</i>).<br>

The parallel passage in Isa 16:9 has the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B=</FONT> and the Greek version presupposes a comparative idea "as with." Many of the modern translations render the passage with the comparative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m!</FONT> as in the alternate translation, but it is unclear what the force of the comparison would be here. The verse is actually in the second person, an apostrophe or direct address to the grapevine(s) of Sibmah. However, the translation has retained the third person throughout because such sudden shifts in person are uncommon in contemporary English literature and retaining the third person is smoother. The Hebrew text reads: "From/With the weeping of Jazer I will weep for you, vine of Sibmah. Your tendrils crossed over the sea. They reached unto the sea of Jazer. Upon your summer fruit and your vintage [grape harvest] the destroyer has fallen."<br>

 <a name="fn2470" href="jer.htm#fnB2470"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (48:32)  Or "reached the sea of Jazer." The Sea is generally taken to be a reference to the Dead Sea. The translation presupposes that the word "sea" is to be omitted before "Jazer." The word is missing from two Hebrew MSS, from the parallel passage in Isa 16:8, and from the Greek version. It may have arisen from a mistaken copying of the same word in the preceding line.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (48:32)  Though there is some doubt about the precise location of these places, <i>Sibmah</i> is generally considered to have been located slightly north and west of Heshbon and <i>Jazer</i> further north toward the border of Ammon not far from the city of Amman. Most commentators see the reference here (and in the parallel in Isa 16:8) to the spread of viticulture westward and northward from the vineyards of Sibmah. Keown, Scalise, Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i>,<i> </i>pp. 318-19, however, see the reference rather to the spread of trade in wine westward beyond the coast of the Mediterranean and eastward into the desert.<br>

Compare 25:30 and 51:41 for the idea.<br>
 <a name="fn2475" href="jer.htm#fnB2475"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (48:34)  The meaning of this verse is very uncertain. The ambiguity of the syntax and the apparent elliptical nature of this text makes the meaning of this verse uncertain. The Hebrew text reads: "From the cry of Heshbon unto Elealeh unto Jahaz they utter their voice from Zoar unto Horonaim Eglath Shelishiyah." The translation and interpretation here are based on interpreting the elliptical syntax here by the parallel passage in Isaiah 15:4-6 where cries of anguish rise from Heshbon and Elealeh which are heard all the way to Jahaz. The people flee southward arriving at Zoar and Eglath Shelishiyah where they voice the news of the destruction in the north. Hence, the present translation interprets the phrase "from the cry of Heshbon unto Elealeh" to be parallel to "Heshbon and Elealeh cry out" and take the preposition "from" with the verb "they utter their voice," i.e., with the cry of Heshbon and Elealeh. The impersonal "they raise their voice" is then treated as a passive and made the subject of the whole verse. There is some debate about the identification of the waters of Nimrim. They may refer to the waters of the Wadi Nimrim which enters the Jordan about eight miles north of the Dead Sea or those of the Wadi en-Numeirah which flows into the southern tip of the Dead Sea from about ten miles south. Most commentators take the reference to be the latter because of association with Zoar. However, if the passage is talking about the destruction in the north which is reported in the south by the fleeing refugees, the reference is probably to the Wadi Nimrim in the north.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (48:34)  <i>Elealeh</i> was about two miles (3.3 km) north of Heshbon. Jahaz was about twenty miles (33 km) south of it. These three cities were in the north and <i>Zoar</i>, <i>Horonaim</i>, and <i>Eglath Shelishiyah</i> were apparently in the south. The verse is speaking about the news of destruction in the north spreading to the south. Comparison should be made with the parallel passage in Isa 15:4-6.<br>

The sentence has been reordered in English to give a better logical flow and the unidentified "he" has been identified as "a nation." The nation is, of course, Babylon, but it is nowhere identified so the referent has been left ambiguous.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (48:40)  Conquering nations are often identified with a swiftly flying eagle swooping down on its victims (cf. Deut 28:49). In this case the eagle is to be identified with the nation (or king) of Babylon (cf. Ezek 17:3, 12 where reference is to the removal of Jehoiachin (Jeconiah) and his replacement with Zedekiah).<br>
 <a name="fn2482" href="jer.htm#fnB2482"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (48:41)  Parallelism argues that the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toYr]q=</FONT> be understood as the otherwise unattested feminine plural of the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hy&#180;r+q!</FONT> "city" rather than the place name Kerioth mentioned in v. 24 (cf. <i>HAL</i> 1065 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hy&#180;r+q!</FONT>).

They will burn up the mountain heights of those war-loving people." The meaning of this verse is not entirely certain because of the highly figurative nature of the last two lines. The Hebrew text has been translated somewhat literally here. The Hebrew text reads: "In the shadow of Heshbon those fleeing stand without strength. For a fire goes forth from Heshbon, a flame from the midst of Sihon. And it devours the forehead of Moab and the skull of the sons of noise." The meaning of the first part is fairly clear because v. 2 has already spoken of the conquest of Heshbon and a plot formed there to conquer the rest of the nation. The fire going forth from Heshbon would hence refer here to the conflagrations of war spreading from Heshbon to the rest of the country. The reference to the "midst of Sihon" is to be understood metonymically as a reference for the ruler to what he once ruled (cf. E. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, p. 583). The last two lines must refer to more than the fugitives who stopped at Heshbon for protection because it refers to the forehead of Moab (a personification of the whole land or nation). It is unclear, however, why reference is made to the foreheads and skulls of the Moabites, other than the fact that this verse seems to be a re-adaptation or reuse of Num 24:17 where the verb used with them is "smite" which fits nicely in the sense of martial destruction. Translated rather literally, it appears here to refer to the destruction by the fires of war of the Moabites, the part (forehead and skulls) put for the whole. TEV sees a reference here to the "frontiers" and "mountain heights" of Moab and this would work nicely for "foreheads" which is elsewhere used of the corner or border of a land in Neh 9:22. The word "crown" or "skull" might be a picturesque metaphor for the mountain heights of a land, but the word is never used elsewhere in such a figurative way. TEV (and CEV) which follows it might be correct here but there is no way to validate it. The meaning "war loving people" for the phrase "sons of noise" is based on the suggestion of BDB 981 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/oav*</FONT> 1 which relates the phrase to the dominant use for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/oav*</FONT> and is adopted also by TEV, CEV, and C. von Orelli, <i>The Prophecies of the Book of Jeremiah</i>, p. 341. REB "braggarts" and NIV "noisy boasters" seem to base the nuance on the usage of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/oav*</FONT> in Jer 46:17 where Pharaoh is referred to as an empty noise and the reference to Moab's arrogance and boasting in 48:29.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (48:45)  This verse and the next are an apparent adaptation and reuse of a victory song in Num 21:28-29 and a prophecy in Num 24:17. That explains the reference to Sihon who was the Amorite king who captured Heshbon and proceeded from there to capture most of northern Moab (the area between Heshbon and the Arnon) which has been referred to earlier in this prophecy. This prophecy appears to speak of the destruction of Moab beginning from the same place under the picture of a destructive fire which burns up all the people. The fire is a reference to the conflagrations of war in which the enemy captures the cities and sets them on fire and burns all the people in them. What Sihon once did (Num 21:28-29) and what Balaam prophesied would happen to Moab in the future (by David? Num 24:17) are being reapplied to a new situation.<br>

 <a name="fn2496" href="jer.htm#fnB2496"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (49:1)  <i>Ammonites</i>. Ammon was a small kingdom to the north and east of Moab which was in constant conflict with the Transjordanian tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh over territorial rights to the lands north and south of the Jabbok River. Ammon mainly centered on the city of Rabbah which is modern Amman. According to Judg 11:13 the Ammonites claimed the land between the Jabbok and the Arnon but this was land taken from them by Sihon and Og and land that the Israelites captured from the latter two kings. The Ammonites attempted to expand into the territory of Israel in the Transjordan in the time of Jephthah (Judg 10-11) and the time of Saul (1 Sam 11). Apparently when Tiglath Pileser carried away the Israelite tribes in Transjordan in 733 B.C., the Ammonites took over possession of their cities (Jer 49:1). Like Moab they appear to have been loyal to Nebuchadnezzar in the early part of his reign, forming part of the contingent that he sent to harass Judah when Jehoiakim rebelled in 598 B.C. (2 Kgs 24:2). But along with Moab and Edom they sent representatives to plot rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar in 594 B.C. (Jer 27:3). The Ammonites were evidently in rebellion against him in 588 B.C. when he had to decide whether to attack Rabbah or Jerusalem first (Ezek 21:18-23 [21:23-28 HT]). They appear to have remained in rebellion after the destruction of Jerusalem because their king Baalis was behind the plot to assassinate Gedaliah and offered refuge to Ishmael after he did it (Jer 40:13; 41:15). According to the Jewish historian Josephus they were conquered in 582 B.C. by Nebuchadnezzar.<br>

Hence the meaning that is generally agreed on is reflected in an admittedly paraphrastic translation. The reference is to the fact that the Ammonites had taken possession of the cities that had been deserted when the Assyrians carried off the Transjordanian tribes in 733 B.C. assuming that the Israelites would not return in sufficient numbers to regain control of it. The thought underlying the expression "Why has Milcom taken possession..." reflects the idea, common in the OT and the ancient Near East, that the god of a people drove out the previous inhabitants, gave their land to his worshipers to possess, and took up residence with them there (cf., e.g., Deut 1:21; Judg 11:24 and line 33-34 of the Moabite stone: "Chemosh said to me, `Go down, fight against Hauronen.'

It is difficult to tell whether the word "daughters" is used here in the same sense that it has in v. 2 (see the translator's note there) or in the literal sense of "daughters." The former has been preferred because the cities themselves (e.g., Heshbon) are called to wail in the earlier part of the verse and the term "daughters" has been used in the previous verse of the surrounding villages.<br>
 <a name="fn2504" href="jer.htm#fnB2504"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tc</b> (49:3)  Or "Run back and forth inside the walls of your towns." Or "slash yourselves with gashes." The meaning of this line is uncertain. The Hebrew text reads "run back and forth among the walls." The word "run back and forth" is generally taken as a Hitpolel of a verb that means to "go about" in the Qal and to "go back and forth" in the Polel (cf. BDB 1002 s.v. I <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">fWv</FONT>). The noun that follows in the Hebrew means "wall, hedge" and is quite commonly modified by the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ax)</FONT> ("sheep") referring to sheepfolds (cf., e.g., Num 32:36; 1 Sam 24:3). But the phrase "run back and forth among the sheepfolds" yields little meaning here. In Ps 89:40 (89:41 HT) the word "wall" is used in parallelism with fortified cities and refers to the walls of the city. That is the sense that is assumed in one of the alternate translations with the words "of your towns" being supplied in the translation for clarification. However, that figure is a little odd in a context which speaks of mourning rites. Hence, some emend the word "walls" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tord}G+</FONT>) to "gashes" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">todd%G+</FONT>) a word that has occurred in a similar context in Jer 48:37. That would involve only the common confusion of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">r</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">d</FONT>. That is the reading adopted here and fits the context nicely. NRSV appears to go one step further and read the verb as a Hitpolel from a root that is otherwise used only as a noun to mean "whip" or "scourge." NRSV reads "slash yourselves with whips" which also makes excellent sense in the context but is not supported by any parallel use of the verb.<br>

The meaning of the first two lines of this verse are uncertain primarily due to the ambiguity of the expression <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Eq@m=u! bz&#180;</FONT>. The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bz&#180;</FONT> is either a Qal perfect or Qal participle of a verb meaning flow. It is common in the expression "a land flowing with milk and honey" and is also common to refer to the seminal discharge or discharge of blood which makes a man or woman unclean. BDB 264 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWz</FONT> Qal 2 sees it as an abbreviation of the idea of "flowing with milk and honey" and sees it as referring to the fertility of Ammon's valley. However, there are no other examples of such an ellipsis. Several of the modern translations and commentaries have taken the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qm#u@</FONT> not as a reference to a valley but to the homonym cited in the note on 47:5 and see the reference here to the flowing away of Ammon's strength. That interpretation is followed here.

Its borders varied over time but basically Edom lay in the hundred mile strip between the Gulf of Aqabah on the south and the Zered River on the north. It straddled the Arabah leading down from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqabah, having as its northern neighbors both Judah and Moab. A long history of hostility existed between Israel and Edom, making Edom one of the favorite objects of the prophets' oracles of judgment (cf., e.g., Isa 21:11-12; 34:5-15; 63:1-6; Amos 1:11-12; Ezek 25:12-14; 35:1-15; Obad 1-16). Not much is known about Edom at this time other than the fact that they participated in the discussions regarding rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar in 594 B.C. According to Obadiah 10-16 they not only gloated over Judah's downfall in 586 B.C. but participated in its plunder and killed some of those who were fleeing the country.<br>

Some take it as a reference for the Dedanites who were not native to Edom to go down from the heights of Edom and go back home (so Keown, Scalise, Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i>,<i> </i>p. 330). The majority of commentaries, however, take it as a reference to the Dedanites disassociating themselves from the Edomites and finding remote hiding places to live in (so J.

 <a name="fn2521" href="jer.htm#fnB2521"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:9)  The tense and nuance of the verb translated "pillage" are both different than the verb in Obad 5. There the verb is the imperfect of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bn~G&#180;</FONT> "to steal." Here the verb is the perfect of a verb which means to "ruin" or "spoil." The translations and commentaries, however, almost all render the verb here in much the same way as in Obad 5. The nuance must mean they only "ruin, destroy" (by stealing) only as much as they need (<i>Heb</i> "their sufficiency"), and the verb is used as metonymical substitute, effect for cause. The perfect must be some kind of a future perfect; "would they not have destroyed only..." The negative question is carried over by ellipsis from the preceding lines.<br>

And none of their neighbors will say, `Leave your orphans with me and I'll keep them alive. Your widows can trust in me.'" This latter interpretation is based on a reading in a couple of the Greek versions (Symmachus and Lucian) and is accepted by a number of the modern commentaries, (J. Bright, J. Thompson, W. Holladay, and Keown, Scalise, Smothers). However, the majority of modern translations do not follow it and lacking any other Hebrew or versional evidence it is probable that this is an interpretation to explain the mitigation of what appears as a prophecy of utter annihilation. There have been other cases in Jeremiah where a universal affirmation (either positive or negative) has been modified in the verses that follow. The verb in the second line <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wjf*b=T!</FONT> is highly unusual; it is a second masculine plural form with a feminine plural subject. The form is explained in GKC &#167;47.<i>k</i> and &#167;60.<i>a</i>, note1 as a pausal substitution for the normal form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hn&#180;j=f^b=T!</FONT> and a similar form in Ezek 37:7 cited as a parallel.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (49:12)  The reference here is to the cup of God's wrath which is connected with the punishment of war at the hands of the Babylonians referred to already in Jer 25:15-29. Those who do not deserve to drink are the innocent victims of war who get swept away with the guilty. Edom was certainly not one of the innocent victims as is clear from this judgment speech and those referred to in the study note on 49:7.<br>

They have been supplied in the translation to mark the shift from the address of the messenger summoning the nations to prepare to do battle against Edom. The LORD is clearly the speaker (see the end of v. 16) and Edom is clearly the addressee. Such sudden shifts are common in Hebrew poetry, particularly Hebrew prophecy, but are extremely disruptive to a modern reader trying to follow the argument of a passage. TEV adds "The LORD said" and then retains third person throughout. CEV puts all of vv. 14-16 in the second person and uses indirect discourse in v. 15.<br>

However, it is related to a verb root that refers to the shaking of the pillars (of the earth) in Job 9:6 and a noun (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tx#l#p=m!</FONT>) that refers to "horror" or "shuddering" used in Job 21:6; Isa 21:4; Ezek 7:18; Ps 55:6. This is the nuance that is accepted by BDB, KBL, <i>HAL</i> and a majority of the modern translations. The suffix is an objective genitive. The fact that the following verb is masculine singular suggests that the text here (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Et*a) ayV!h!</FONT>) is in error for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Et*a*yV!h!</FONT> (so Keown, Scalise, Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i>,<i> </i>p. 327, fn 16.a).<br>

The sentence has been restructured to better conform with contemporary English style and the significance of the simile drawn from the comparison has been spelled out for the sake of clarity. The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hu*yG]r+a^</FONT> is functioning here as an adverbial modifier in a construction of verbal hendiadys (cf. GKC &#167;120.<i>g</i>).<br>

The figure of the lion among the flock of sheep appears to be carried on here where the people are referred to as a flock and their homeland is referred to as a sheepfold. It is hard, however, to carry the figure over here into the translation, so the figures have been interpreted instead. Both of these last two sentences are introduced by a formula that indicates a strong affirmative oath (i.e., they are introduced by <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aO &lt;a!</FONT> [cf. BDB 50 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;a!</FONT> 1.b(2)]). The subject of the verb "they will drag them off" is the indefinite third plural which may be taken as a passive in English (cf. GKC &#167;144.<i>g</i>). The subject of the last line is the LORD which has been rendered in the first person for stylistic reasons (see the translator's note on the beginning of the verse).<br>

It was the capital of the Aramean state that was in constant hostility with Israel from the time of David until its destruction by the Assyrians in 732 B.C. At various times it was allied with the Aramean state of Hamath which was further north. Contingents from these Aramean states were involved in harassing Judah and Jerusalem in 598 B.C. when Jehoiakim rebelled (2 Kgs 24:2) but little is heard about them in the rest of the book of Jeremiah or in the history of this period.<br>

However, since it is really the people who are involved and it is clearer for the modern reader, the present translation supplies the words "people of" both here and in v. 24. The verbs in vv. 23-25 are all to be interpreted as prophetic perfects, the tense of the Hebrew verb that views an action as though it were as good as done. The verbs are clearly future in vv. 26-27 which begin with a "therefore."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (49:23)  <i>Hamath</i> was a city on the Orontes River about 110 miles (183 km) north of Damascus. <i>Arpad</i> was a city that was 95 miles (158 km) farther north from there. These two cities were in the path of the northern descent of the kings of Assyria and Babylonia and had been conquered earlier under the Assyrian kings (Isa 10:9; 36:19; 37:13). The apparent reference here is to their terror and loss of courage when they hear the news that Nebuchadnezzar's armies are on the move toward them and Damascus. They would have been in the path of Nebuchadnezzar as he chased Necho south after the battle of Carchemish.<br>
 <a name="fn2549" href="jer.htm#fnB2549"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tc</b> (49:23)  The meaning of this verse is very uncertain. The Hebrew text apparently reads "Hamath and Arpad are dismayed. They melt away because they have heard bad news. Anxiety is in the sea; it [the sea] cannot be quiet." Many commentaries and translations redivide the verse and read "like the sea" for "in the sea" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;Y&#180;K^</FONT> for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;Y&#180;B^</FONT>) and read the feminine singular noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hg&#180;a*D+</FONT> as though it were the third masculine plural verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wga&amp;D&#180;</FONT> "They are troubled like the sea." The translation follows the emendation proposed in <i>BHS</i> and accepted by a number of commentaries (e.g., J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 333, J. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 723 and fn 1).

The translation also involves a double reading of "heart," for the sake of English style, once in the sense of courage (BDB 525 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bl@</FONT> 10) because that is the nuance that best fits "melts" in the English idiom and once in the more general sense of hearts as the seat of fear, anxiety, worry.

Midian and Amalek were consider to be located in the region in north Arabia east of Ezion Geber. That would put them in the same general locality as the region of Kedar.

 <b>sn</b> (49:34)  <i>Elam</i> was a country on the eastern side of the Tigris River in what is now southwestern Iran. Its capital city was Susa. It was destroyed in 640 B.C. by Ashurbanipal after a long period of conflict with the Assyrian kings. It appears from Babylonian records to have regained its independence shortly thereafter, perhaps as early as 625 B.C., and was involved in the fall of Assyria in 612 B.C. If the date refers to the first year of Zedekiah's rule (597 B.C.), this prophecy appears to be later than the previous ones (cf. the study notes on 46:2 and 47:1).<br>

The phrase does not mean that God will break literal bows or that he will destroy their weapons (synecdoche of species for genus) or their military power (so Hos 1:5). Because of the parallelism, the "bow" here stands for the archers who wield the bow, and were the strongest force (or chief contingent) in their military.<br>

Or more literally, "I will bring the four winds against Elam / from the four quarters of heaven. / I will scatter...." However, the winds are not to be understood literally here. God isn't going to "blow the Elamites" out of Elam with natural forces. The winds must figuratively represent enemy forces that God will use to drive them out.

Those who argue for the former idea point to the supposed parallels in 1:15 (which the present translation understands not to refer to this but to setting up siege) and 43:8-13.

Contingents of these many nations were included in her army and reference is made to them in 50:9 and 51:27-28. There is also some irony involved here because the "enemy from the north" referred to so often in Jeremiah (cf. 1:14; 4:6; 6:1) has been identified with Babylon (cf. 25:9). Here in a kind of talionic justice Judah's nemesis from the north will be attacked and devastated by an enemy from the north.<br>

They shall go, weeping as they go, and they will seek the LORD their God." The concept of "seeking" the LORD often has to do with seeking the LORD in worship (by sacrifice [Hos 5:6; 2 Chr 11:16]; prayer [Zech 8:21, 22; 2 Sam 12:16; Isa 65:1; 2 Chr 15:4]). In Hos 7:10 it is in parallel with returning to the LORD. In Ps 69:6 it is in parallel with hoping in or trusting in the LORD. Perhaps the most helpful parallels here, however, are Hos 3:5 (in comparison with Jer 30:9) and 2 Chr 15:15 where it is in the context of a covenant commitment to be loyal to the LORD which is similar to the context here (see the next verse). The translation is admittedly paraphrastic but "seeking the LORD" doesn't mean here looking for God as though he were merely a person to be found.<br>

The places named were all in Northern Israel and in the Transjordan, lands that were lost to the Assyrians in the period 738-722 B.C. All of these places were known for their fertility, for their woods and their pastures. The hills (hill country) of Ephraim formed the center of Northern Israel. Mount Carmel lies on the seacoast of the Mediterranean north and west of the hill country of Ephraim. Gilead formed the central part of Transjordan and was used to refer at times to the territory between the Yarmuk and Jabbok Rivers, at times to the territory between the Yarmuk and the Arnon Rivers, and at times for all of Israel in the Transjordan. Bashan refers to the territory north of Gilead.<br>

The passive construction "will be sought" raises the question of who is doing the seeking which is not really the main point. The translation has avoided this question by simply referring to the result which is the main point.<br>

It is generally agreed that the names of these two regions were chosen for their potential for wordplay. Merathaim probably refers to a region in southern Babylon near where the Tigris and Euphrates come together before they empty into the Persian Gulf. It was known for its briny waters. In Hebrew the word would mean "double rebellion" and would stand as an epithet for the land of Babylon as a whole. Pekod refers to an Aramean people who lived on the eastern bank of the lower Tigris River. They are mentioned often in Assyrian texts and are mentioned in Ezek 23:23 as allies of Babylon. In Hebrew the word would mean "punishment." As an epithet for the land of Babylon it would refer to the fact that Babylon was to be punished for her double rebellion against the LORD.<br>

The word translated "kill" or "smite down" is a word of uncertain meaning and derivation. BDB 352 s.v.

II <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">br~j*</FONT> sees it as a denominative from the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">br\j#</FONT> "sword," a derivation which many modern commentaries accept and reflect in a translation "put to the sword." KBL, however, gives "to smite down; to slaughter" which is roughly the equivalent of the meaning assigned to it in BDB. The word only occurs here and in v. 27 in the Qal and in 2 Kgs 3:23 in the Niphal where it means something like "attacked one another, fought with one another." Many commentators question the validity of the word "after them" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;h#yr}j&amp;a^</FONT>) which occurs at the end of the line after "completely destroy." The Targum reads "the last of them" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;t*yr]j&amp;a^</FONT>) which is graphically very close and accepted by some commentators. The present translation has chosen to represent "after them" by a paraphrase at the beginning "pursue them."<br>

The "hammer" is a metaphor for Babylon who was God's war club to shatter the nations and destroy kingdoms just like Assyria is represented in Isa 10:5 as a rod and a war club. Some readers, however, might not pick up on the metaphor or identify the referent, so the translation has incorporated an identification of the metaphor and the referent within it. "See how" and "See what" are an attempt to capture the nuance of the Hebrew particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Eya@</FONT> which here expresses an exclamation of satisfaction in a taunt song (cf. BDB 32 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Eya@</FONT> 2 and compare usage in Isa 14:4, 12; Jer 50:23).<br>

The same causal connection is maintained by the order of the translation but it puts more emphasis on the cause and connects it also more closely with the first half of the verse. The first person is used because the LORD is speaking of himself first in the first person "I set" and then in the third. The first person has been maintained throughout. Though it would be awkward, perhaps one could retain the reference to the LORD by translating, "I, the LORD."<br>

The problem of the LORD referring to himself in the third person (or of the prophet speaking on his behalf) is again raised here and is again resolved by using the first person throughout. The construction "weapons of my wrath" would not convey any meaning to many readers so the significance has been spelled out in the translation.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (50:25)  The <i>weapons</i> are the nations which God is bringing from the north against them. Reference has already been made in the study notes that Assyria is the "rod" or "war club" by which God vents his anger against Israel (Isa 10:5-6) and Babylon a hammer or war club with which he shatters the nations (Jer 50:23; 51:20). Now God will use other nations as weapons to execute his wrath against Babylon. For a similar idea see Isa 13:2-5 where reference is made to marshaling the nations against Babylon. Some of the nations that the LORD will marshal against Babylon are named in Jer 51:27-28.<br>

 <a name="fn2645" href="jer.htm#fnB2645"><sup>63</sup></a><b>tn</b> (50:26)  <i>Heb</i> "Come against her from the end." There is a great deal of debate about the meaning of "from the end" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">JQ@m!</FONT>). Some follow the suggestion of F. Giesebrecht in BDB 892 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hx#q*</FONT> 3 and emend the text to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hx#Q*m!</FONT> on the basis of the presumed parallel in Jer 51:31 which is interpreted as "on all sides," i.e., "from every quarter/side." However, the phrase does not mean that in Jer 51:31 but is used as it is elsewhere of "from one end to another," i.e., in its entirety (so Gen 19:4). The only real parallel here is the use of the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jq@</FONT> with a suffix in Isa 37:24 referring to the remotest part, hence something like from the end (of the earth), i.e., from a far away place. The referent "her" has been clarified here to refer to Babylonia in case someone might not see the connection between v. 25d and v. 26.<br>
 <a name="fn2646" href="jer.htm#fnB2646"><sup>64</sup></a><b>tn</b> (50:26)  <i>Heb</i> "Pile her up like heaps." Many commentators understand the comparison to be to heaps of grain (compare usage of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*r}u&amp;</FONT> in Hag 2:16; Neh 13:15; Ruth 3:7). However, BDB 790 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*r}u&amp;</FONT> is more likely correct that this refers to heaps of ruins (compare the usage in Neh 4:2 [3:34 HT]).<br>

This is virtually certain because of the reference to the time coming for them to be punished; this would scarcely fit literal bulls.

The syntax is elliptical because there is no main verb. The present translation has supplied the verb "come" as many other translations have done. The translation also expands the genitival expression "vengeance for his temple" to explain what all the commentaries agree is involved.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (50:28)  This verse appears to be a parenthetical exclamation of the prophet in the midst of his report of what the LORD said through him. He throws himself into the future and sees the fall of Babylon and hears the people reporting in Zion how God has destroyed Babylon to get revenge for the Babylonians destroying his temple. Jeremiah prophesied from 627 B.C. (see the study note on 1:2) until sometime after 586 B.C. after Jerusalem fell and he was taken to Egypt. The fall of Babylon occurred in 538 B.C. some fifty years later. However, Jeremiah had prophesied as early as the first year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign (605 B.C.; Jer 25:1) that many nations and great kings would come and subject Babylon, the instrument of God's wrath--his sword against the nations--to bondage (Jer 25:12-14).<br>

Once again there is the problem of the LORD speaking about himself in the third person (or the prophet dropping his identification with the LORD).

I will start a fire in his towns and it will consume all that surround him." The personification continues but now the stance is indirect (third person) rather than direct (second person). It is easier for the modern reader who is not accustomed to such sudden shifts if the second person is maintained. The personification of the city (or nation) as masculine is a little unusual; normally cities and nations are personified as feminine, as daughters or mothers.<br>

 <a name="fn2665" href="jer.htm#fnB2665"><sup>83</sup></a><b>sn</b> (50:34)  <i>Heb</i> "their redeemer." The Hebrew term "redeemer" referred in Israelite family law to the nearest male relative who was responsible for securing the freedom of a relative who had been sold into slavery. For further discussion of this term as well as its metaphorical use to refer to God as the one who frees Israel from bondage in Egypt and from exile in Assyria and Babylonia see the study note on 31:11.<br>
 <a name="fn2666" href="jer.htm#fnB2666"><sup>84</sup></a><b>tn</b> (50:34)  <i>Heb</i> "Yahweh of armies is his name." For the rendering of this title see the study note on 2:19.<br>
 <a name="fn2667" href="jer.htm#fnB2667"><sup>85</sup></a><b>tn</b> (50:34)  Or "he will certainly champion." The infinitive absolute before the finite verb here is probably functioning to intensify the verb rather than to express the certainty of the action (cf.

 <a name="fn2668" href="jer.htm#fnB2668"><sup>86</sup></a><b>tn</b> (50:34)  This appears to be another case where the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/u^m^l=</FONT> introduces a result rather than giving the purpose or goal.

 <a name="fn2669" href="jer.htm#fnB2669"><sup>87</sup></a><b>tn</b> (50:34)  <i>Heb</i> "he will bring rest to the earth and will cause unrest to." The terms "rest" and "unrest" have been doubly translated to give more of the idea underlying these two concepts.<br>
 <a name="fn2670" href="jer.htm#fnB2670"><sup>88</sup></a><b>tn</b> (50:34)  This translation again reflects the problem often encountered in these prophecies where the LORD appears to be speaking but refers to himself in the third person. It would be possible to translate here using the first person as CEV and NIrV do. However, to sustain that over the whole verse results in a considerably greater degree of paraphrase. The verse could be rendered "But I am strong and I will rescue them. I am the LORD who rules over all. I will champion their cause. And I will bring peace and rest to...."<br>
 <a name="fn2671" href="jer.htm#fnB2671"><sup>89</sup></a><b>tn</b> (50:35)  <i>Heb</i> "the Chaldeans." For explanation of the rendering see the study note on 21:4. There is no verb in this clause. Therefore it is difficult to determine whether this should be understood as a command or as a prediction. The presence of <i>vav</i> consecutive perfects after a similar construction in vv. 36b, d, 37c, 38a and the imperfects after "therefore" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/k@l*</FONT>) all suggest the predictive or future nuance. However, the <i>vav</i> consecutive perfect could be used to carry on the nuance of command (cf. GKC &#167;112.<i>q</i>) but not in the sense of purpose as NRSV, NJPS render them.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (50:35)  <i>Heb</i> "A sword against the Chaldeans." The "sword" here is metaphorical for destructive forces in the persons of the armies of the north (vv. 3, 9) which the LORD is marshaling against Babylon and which he has addressed by way of command several times (e.g., vv. 14, 21, 26-27, 29).

 <a name="fn2673" href="jer.htm#fnB2673"><sup>91</sup></a><b>tn</b> (50:36)  The meaning and the derivation of the word translated "false prophets" is uncertain. The same word appears in conjunction with the word for "diviners" in Isa 44:25 and probably also in Hos 11:6 in conjunction with the sword consuming them "because of their counsel." BDB 95 s.v. III <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dB^</FONT> b sees this as a substitution of "empty talk" for "empty talkers" (the figure of metonymy) and refer to them as false prophets. KBL 108 s.v. II <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dB^</FONT> emends the form in both places to read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yr]B*</FONT> (in place of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yD]B^</FONT>) and defines the word on the basis of Akkadian to mean "soothsayer" (KBL 146 s.v. V <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rB*</FONT>). <i>HAL</i> 105 s.v. V <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dB^</FONT> retains the pointing, derives it from an Amorite word found in the Mari letters, and defines it as "oracle priest." However, Keown, Scalise, Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i>,<i> </i>p. 368 call this identification into question because the word only occurs in one letter from Mari and its meaning is uncertain there. It is hazardous to emend the text in two places, perhaps even three, in light of no textual evidence in any of the passages and to define the word on the basis of an uncertain parallel. Hence the present translation opts here for the derivation and extended definition given in BDB.<br>
 <a name="fn2674" href="jer.htm#fnB2674"><sup>92</sup></a><b>tn</b> (50:36)  This translation follows the suggestion of BDB 383 s.v. I <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la^y&#180;</FONT> Niph 2. Compare the usage in Isa 19:13 and Jer 5:4.<br>
 <a name="fn2675" href="jer.htm#fnB2675"><sup>93</sup></a><b>tn</b> (50:36)  The verb here (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tt^j*</FONT>) could also be rendered "be destroyed" (cf. BDB 369 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tt^j*</FONT> Qal 1 and compare the usage in Jer 48:20, 39). However, the parallelism with "shown to be fools" argues for the more dominant usage of "be dismayed" or "be filled with terror." The verb is found in parallelism with both <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">voB</FONT> "be ashamed, dismayed" and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ar}y&#180;</FONT> "be afraid" and can refer to either emotion. Here it is more likely that they are filled with terror because of the approaching armies.<br>
 <a name="fn2676" href="jer.htm#fnB2676"><sup>94</sup></a><b>tn</b> (50:37)  Hebrew has "his" in both cases here whereas the rest of the possessive pronouns throughout vv. 35-37 are "her." There is no explanation for this switch unless the third masculine singular refers as a distributive singular to the soldiers mentioned in the preceding verse (cf. GKC &#167;145.<i>l</i>). This is probably the case here, but to refer to "their horses and their chariots" in the midst of all the "her..." might create more confusion than what it is worth to be that pedantic.<br>

The sentence had to be split up because it is too long and the continuation of the second half with its consequential statement would not fit together with the first half very well. Hence the subject and verb have been repeated. The Hebrew word translated "foreign troops" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">br\u#</FONT>) is the same word that is used in 25:20 to refer to the foreign peoples living in Egypt and in Exod 12:38 for the foreign people that accompanied Israel out of Egypt. Here the word is translated contextually to refer to foreign mercenaries, an identification that most of the commentaries and many of the modern translations accept (see, e.g., J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 355 and NRSV, NIV). The significance of the simile "they will become like women" has been spelled out for the sake of clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn2679" href="jer.htm#fnB2679"><sup>97</sup></a><b>tc</b> (50:38)  <i>Heb</i> "a drought against her waters and they will dry up." Several of the commentaries and modern translations accept the emendation proposed by <i>BHS</i> and read here "sword" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">br\j#</FONT> in place of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">br\j)</FONT>, the change of only one vowel) in keeping with the rest of the context. According to <i>BHS</i> this reading is supported by the Lucianic and Hexaplaric recensions of the LXX (the Greek version) and the Syriac version. In this case the drying up of the waters (of the canals) is attributed to neglect brought about by war conditions. However, it is just as likely that these versions are influenced by the repetition of the word "sword" as the Hebrew and the other versions are influenced by the concept of "drying up" of the waters to read "drought." Hence the present translation, along with the majority of modern translations, retains the Hebrew "drought."<br>
 <a name="fn2680" href="jer.htm#fnB2680"><sup>98</sup></a><b>tn</b> (50:38)  <i>Heb</i> "for it is a land of idols." The "for," however, goes back to the whole context not just to the preceding prediction (cf.

 <a name="fn2681" href="jer.htm#fnB2681"><sup>99</sup></a><b>tc</b> (50:38)  Or "Her people boast in." This translation is based on the reading of the majority of Hebrew MSS which read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wll*h)t=y]</FONT> (cf. usage in Jer 46:9 and see also 25:16; 51:7). Two Hebrew MSS and the versions read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WlL*h^t=y]</FONT> (cf. usage in Jer 4:2; 9:23, 24 and Ps 97:7 where a parallel expression is found with "idols"). The reading is again basically the difference in one Hebrew vowel. All of the modern commentaries consulted and all the modern translations except NEB, REB follow the Hebrew text here rather than the versions.<br>
 <a name="fn2682" href="jer.htm#fnB2682"><sup>100</sup></a><b>tn</b> (50:38)  <i>Heb</i> "by the terrors." However, as <i>HAL</i> 40 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*ya@</FONT> indicates these are "images that cause terror" (a substitution of the effect for the cause). The translation of this line follows the interpretation of the majority of modern translations and all the commentaries consulted. NIV, NCV, and God's Word reflect a different syntax, understanding the subject to be the idols just mentioned rather than "her people" which is supplied here for the sake of clarity (the Hebrew text merely says "they.") Following that lead, one could render "but those idols will go mad with terror." This makes excellent sense in the context which often refers to effects (vv. 36b, d, 37c, 38b) of the war that is coming. However, that interpretation does not fit as well with the following "therefore/so," which basically introduces a judgment or consequence after an accusation of sin.<br>

For the meaning of this last phrase compare the usage in Ps 100:5 and Isaiah 13:20.

The verbs are translated as future because the passage is prophetic and the verbs may be interpreted as prophetic perfects (the action viewed as if it were as good as done). In the parallel passage in 6:24 the verbs could be understood as present perfects because the passage could be viewed as in the present. Here it is future.<br>

The repetition of prophecies here and in the following verses emphasizes the talionic nature of God's punishment of Babylon; as they have done to others, so it will be done to them (cf. 25:14; 50:15).<br>
 <a name="fn2693" href="jer.htm#fnB2693"><sup>111</sup></a><b>tn</b> (50:45)  The words "of Babylonia" are not in the text but are implicit from the context. They have been supplied in the translation to clarify the referent.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (50:45)  The verbs in vv. 22-25 are all descriptive of the present, but all of this is really to take place in the future. Hebrew poetry has a way of rendering future actions as though they were already accomplished. The poetry of this section makes it difficult, however, to render the verbs as future as the present translation has regularly done.<br>
 <a name="fn2694" href="jer.htm#fnB2694"><sup>112</sup></a><b>tn</b> (50:46)  <i>Heb</i> "among the nations." With the exception of this phrase, the different verb in v. 46a, the absence of a suffix on the word for "land" in v. 45d, the third plural suffix instead of the third singular suffix on the verb for "chase...off of," this passage is identical with 49:19-21 with the replacement of Babylon or the land of the Chaldeans for Edom. For the translation notes explaining the details of the translation here see the translator's notes on 49:19-21.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (50:46)  This passage is virtually identical with Jer 49:19-21 with the replacement of Babylon, land of Babylonia for Edom. As God used Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians to destroy Edom, so he would use Cyrus and the Medes and Persians and their allies to destroy Babylon (cf. 25:13, 14). As Nebuchadnezzar was God's servant to whom all would be subject (25:9; 27:6), so Cyrus is called in Isaiah "his anointed one," i.e., his chosen king whom he will use to shatter other nations and set Israel free (Isa 45:1-4).<br>
 <a name="fn2695" href="jer.htm#fnB2695"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (51:1)  The <i>destructive wind</i> is a figurative reference to the "foreign people" who will "winnow" Babylon and drive out all the people (v. 2). This figure has already been used in 4:11-12 and in 49:36. See the study note on 4:11-12 and the translator's notes on 22:22 and 49:36.<br>
 <a name="fn2696" href="jer.htm#fnB2696"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:1)  Or "I will arouse the spirit of hostility of a destroying nation"; <i>Heb</i> "I will stir up against Babylon...a destroying wind [or, the spirit of a destroyer]." The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">j^Wr</FONT> can refer to either a wind (BDB 924 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">j^Wr</FONT> 2.a) or a spirit (BDB 925 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">j^Wr</FONT> 2.g). It can be construed as either a noun followed by an adjectival participle (so, "a destroying wind") or a noun followed by another noun in the "of" relationship (a construct or genitival relationship; so, "spirit of a destroyer"). The same noun with this same verb is translated "stir up the spirit of" in 1 Chr 5:26; 2 Chr 21:16; 36:22; Hag 1:14; and most importantly in Jer 51:11 where it refers to the king of the Medes. However, the majority of the exegetical tradition (all the commentaries consulted and all the translations except NASB and NIV) opt for the "destructive wind" primarily because of the figure of winnowing that is found in the next verse. The translation follows the main line exegetical tradition here for that same reason.<br>
 <a name="fn2697" href="jer.htm#fnB2697"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (51:1)  <i>Heb</i> "the people who live in Leb-qamai." "Leb-qamai" is a code name for "Chaldeans" formed on the principle of substituting the last letter of the alphabet for the first, the next to the last for the second, and so on. This same principle is used in referring to Babylon in 25:27 and 51:41 as "Sheshach." See the study note on 25:27 where further details are given. There is no consensus on why the code name is used because the terms Babylon and Chaldeans (= Babylonians) have appeared regularly in this prophecy or collection of prophecies.<br>
 <a name="fn2698" href="jer.htm#fnB2698"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:2)  Or "I will send foreign people against Babylonia." The translation follows the reading of the Greek recensions of Aquila and Symmachus and the Latin version (the Vulgate). That reading is accepted by the majority of modern commentaries and several of the modern versions (e.g., NRSV, REB, NAB, and God's Word). It fits better with the verb that follows it than the reading of the Hebrew text and the rest of the versions. The difference in the two readings is again only the difference in vocalization, the Hebrew text reading <i>zarim</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yr]z&#180;</FONT>) and the versions cited reading <i>zorim </i>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yr]z{</FONT>). If the Hebrew text is followed, there is a wordplay between the two words, "foreigners" and "winnow." The words "like a wind blowing away chaff" have been supplied in the translation to clarify for the reader what "winnow" means.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (51:2)  Winnowing involved throwing a mixture of grain and chaff (or straw) into the air and letting the wind blow away the lighter chaff, leaving the grain to fall on the ground. Since God considered all the Babylonians chaff, they would all be "blown away."<br>
 <a name="fn2699" href="jer.htm#fnB2699"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:2)  Or "They will strip her land bare like a wind blowing away chaff." The alternate translation would be necessary if one were to adopt the alternate reading of the first line (the reading of the Hebrew text). The explanation of "winnow" would then be necessary in the second line. The verb translated "strip...bare" means literally "to empty out" (see BDB 132 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qq^B*</FONT> Polel). It has been used in 19:7 in the Qal of "making void" Judah's plans in a wordplay on the word for "bottle." See the study note on 19:7 for further details.<br>
 <a name="fn2700" href="jer.htm#fnB2700"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:2)  This assumes that the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> is temporal (cf. BDB 473 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> 2.a). This is the interpretation adopted also by NRSV and Keown, Scalise, Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i>,<i> </i>p. 349. J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 345 and J. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 747, fn 3 interpret it as asseverative or emphatic, "Truly, indeed." Many of the modern translations merely ignore it. Reading it as temporal makes it unnecessary to emend the following verb as Bright and Thompson do (from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wyh*</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wyh=y]</FONT>).<br>

 <a name="fn2702" href="jer.htm#fnB2702"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tc</b> (51:3)  The text and consequent meaning of these first two lines are uncertain. Literally the Masoretic reads "against let him string let him string the one who strings his bow and against let him raise himself up in his coat of armor." This makes absolutely no sense and the ancient translations and Hebrew MSS did not agree in reading this same text. Many Hebrew MSS and all the versions as well as the Masoretes themselves (the text is left unpointed with a marginal note not to read it) delete the second "let him string." The LXX (or Greek version) left out the words "against" at the beginning of the first two lines. It reads "Let the archer bend his bow and let the one who has armor put it on." The Lucianic recension of the LXX and some Targum MSS supplied the missing object "it" and thus read "Let the archer ready his bow against it and let him array himself against it in his coat of mail." This makes good sense but does not answer the question of why the Hebrew text left off the suffix on the preposition twice in a row. Many Hebrew MSS and the Syriac, Targum, and Vulgate (the Latin version) change the pointing of "against" (<i>`el</i> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la#</FONT>]) to "not" (<i>`al</i> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la^</FONT>]) and thus read "Let the archer not string the bow and let him not array himself in his armor." However, many commentators feel that this does not fit the context because it would apparently be addressed to the Babylonians, not the enemy, which would create a sudden shift in addressee with the second half of the verse. However, if it is understood in the sense taken here it refers to the enemy not allowing the Babylonian archers to get ready for the battle, i.e., a surprise attack. This sense is suggested as an alternative in J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 346, fn u-u, and J. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 747, fn 5 and is the interpretation adopted in TEV and probably also in NIrV.<br>

 <a name="fn2705" href="jer.htm#fnB2705"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:4)  <i>Heb</i> "the land of the Chaldeans." See the study note on 21:4 for explanation.<br>
 <a name="fn2706" href="jer.htm#fnB2706"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:4)  The words "cities" is not in the text. The text merely says "in her streets" but the antecedent is "land" and must then refer to the streets of the cities in the land.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (51:5)  The verses from v. 5 to v. 19 all speak of the LORD in the third person. The prophet who is the spokesman for the LORD (50:1) thus is speaking. However, the message is still from God because this was all what he spoke "through the prophet Jeremiah." <br>
 <a name="fn2708" href="jer.htm#fnB2708"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:5)  <i>Heb</i> "Yahweh of armies." For an explanation of this rendering see the study note on 2:19.<br>
 <a name="fn2709" href="jer.htm#fnB2709"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:5)  Or "all, though their land was..." The majority of the modern translations understand the land here to refer to the land of Israel and Judah (the text reads "their land" and Israel and Judah are the nearest antecedents). In this case the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> is concessive (cf. BDB 473 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> 2.c[b]). Many of the modern commentaries understand the referent to be the land of the Chaldeans/Babylonians. However, most of them feel that the line is connected as a causal statement to 51:2-4 and see the line as either textually or logically out of place. However, it need not be viewed as logically out of place. It is parallel to the preceding and gives a second reason why they are to be destroyed. It also forms an excellent transition to the next lines where the exiles and other foreigners are urged to flee and not get caught up in the destruction which is coming "because of her sin." It might be helpful to note that both the adjective "widowed" and the suffix on "their God" are masculine singular, looking at Israel and Judah as one entity. The "their" then goes back not to Israel and Judah of the preceding lines but to the "them" in v. 4. This makes for a better connection with the following and understands the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> in its dominant usage not an extremely rare one (see the comment in BDB 473 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> 2.c[b]). This interpretation is also reflected in RSV.<br>
 <a name="fn2710" href="jer.htm#fnB2710"><sup>16</sup></a><b>sn</b> (51:5)  The <i>Holy One of Israel</i> is a common title for the LORD in the book of Isaiah. It is applied to the LORD only here and in 50:29 in the book of Jeremiah. It is a figure where an attribute of a person is put as a title of a person (compare "your majesty" for a king).<br>
 <a name="fn2711" href="jer.htm#fnB2711"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:6)  The words "you foreign people" are not in the text and many think the referent is the exiles of Judah.

 <b>sn</b> (51:7)  The figure of the cup of the LORD's wrath invoked in Jer 25:15-29 is invoked again here and Babylon is identified as the agent through which the wrath of the LORD is visited on the other nations. See the study note on 25:15 for explanation and further references.<br>
 <a name="fn2715" href="jer.htm#fnB2715"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:7)  <i>Heb</i> "upon the grounds of such conditions the nations have gone mad."<br>
 <a name="fn2716" href="jer.htm#fnB2716"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:8)  The verbs in this verse and the following are all in the Hebrew perfect tense, a tense that often refers to a past action or a past action with present results. However, as the translator's notes have indicated, the prophets use this tense to view the actions as if they were as good as done (the Hebrew prophetic perfect). The stance here is ideal, viewed as already accomplished.<br>
 <a name="fn2717" href="jer.htm#fnB2717"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:9)  The words "Foreigners living there will say" are not in the text but are implicit from the third line.

 <a name="fn2718" href="jer.htm#fnB2718"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:9)  <i>Heb</i> "Leave/abandon her." However, it is smoother in the English translation to make this verb equivalent to the cohortative that follows. <br>
 <a name="fn2719" href="jer.htm#fnB2719"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:9)  This is an admittedly very paraphrastic translation that tries to make the figurative nuance of the Hebrew original understandable for the average reader. The Hebrew text reads: "For her judgment [or, punishment (cf. BDB 1078 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">fP*v=m!</FONT> 1.f) = `execution of judgment'] touches the heavens, and is lifted up as far as the clouds." The figure of hyperbole or exaggeration is being used here to indicate the vastness of Babylon's punishment which is the reason to escape (vv. 6, 9c). For this figure see Deut 1:28 in comparison with Num 13:28 and see also Deut 9:1. In both of the passages in Deut it refers to an exaggeration about the height of the walls of fortified cities. The figure also may be a play on Gen 11:4 where the nations gather in Babylon to build a tower that reaches to the skies. The present translation has interpreted the perfects here as prophetic because it has not happened yet or they would not be encouraging one another to leave and escape. For the idea here compare 50:16.<br>

 <a name="fn2721" href="jer.htm#fnB2721"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:10)  There is some difference of opinion as to the best way to render the Hebrew expression here. Literally it means "brought forth our righteousnesses." BDB 842 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hq*d&#180;x=</FONT> 7.b interprets this of the "righteous acts" of the people of Judah and compares the usage in Isa 64:6; Ezek 3:20; 18:24; 33:13. However, Judah's acts of righteousness (or more simply, their righteousness) was scarcely revealed in their deliverance. Most of the translations and commentaries refer to "vindication" i.e., that the LORD has exonerated or proven Israel's claims to be true. However, that would require more explanation than the idea of "deliverance" which is a perfectly legitimate usage of the term (cf. BDB 842 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hq*d&#180;x=</FONT> 6.a and compare the usage in Isa 46:13; 51:6, 8; 56:1). The present translation interprets the plural form here as a plural of intensity or amplification (GKC &#167;124.<i>e</i>) and the suffix as a genitive of advantage (<i>IBHS</i> &#167;9.5.2e, p. 147). This interpretation is also reflected in REB and God's Word.<br>
 <a name="fn2722" href="jer.htm#fnB2722"><sup>28</sup></a><b>sn</b> (51:11)  The imperatives here and in v. 12 are directed to the soldiers in the armies of the kings from the north (here identified as the kings of Media [see also 50:3, 9; 51:27-28]). They have often been addressed in this prophecy as though they were a present force (see 50:14-16; 50:21 [and the study note there]; 50:26, 29; 51:3) though the passage as a whole is prophetic of the future. This gives some idea of the ideal stance that the prophets adopted when they spoke of the future as though already past (the use of the Hebrew prophetic perfect which has been referred to often in the translator's notes).<br>
 <a name="fn2723" href="jer.htm#fnB2723"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:11)  The meaning of this word is debated.

For a more readily accessible discussion for English readers see W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 2:422-23. The meaning "quiver" fits better with the verb "fill" than the meaning "shield" which is adopted in BDB 1020 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">fl#v#</FONT>. "Quiver" is the meaning adopted also in NRSV, REB, NAB, and NJPS.<br>

At the time this prophecy was probably written they were the dominating force in the northern region, the most likely enemy to Babylon. By the time Babylon fell in 538 B.C. the Medes had been conquered and incorporated in the Persian empire by Cyrus. However, several times in the Bible this entity is known under the combined entity of Media and Persia (Esth 1:3, 4, 18, 19; 10:2; Dan 5:28; 6:8, 12, 15; 8:20). Dan 5:31 credits the capture of Babylon to Darius the Mede, which may have been another name for Cyrus or the name by which Daniel refers to a Median general named Gobryas.<br>

 <a name="fn2732" href="jer.htm#fnB2732"><sup>38</sup></a><b>sn</b> (51:13)  <i>Babylon</i> was situated on the Euphrates River and was surrounded by canals (also called "rivers").<br>

The sentence has been restructured and paraphrased to provide clarity for the average reader. The meaning of the last phrase is debated. For a discussion of the two options see W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 2:423. Most modern commentaries and translations see an allusion to the figure in Isa 38:12 where the reference is to the end of life compared to a tapestry which is suddenly cut off from the loom. Hence, NRSV renders the last line as "the thread of your life is cut" and TEV renders "its thread of life is cut."

 <a name="fn2736" href="jer.htm#fnB2736"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:14)  <i>Heb</i> "I will fill you with men like locusts." The "you" refers to Babylon (Babylon is both the city and the land it ruled, Babylonia) which has been alluded to in the preceding verses under descriptive titles. The words "your land" have been used because of the way the preceding verse has been rendered, alluding to people rather than to the land or city. The allusion of "men" is, of course, to enemy soldiers and they are here compared to locusts both for their quantity and their destructiveness (see Joel 1:4). For the use of the particles <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;a! yK!</FONT> to introduce an oath see BDB 475 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;a! yK!</FONT> 2.c and compare usage in 2 Kgs 5:20; one would normally expect <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aO &lt;a!</FONT> (cf.

 <a name="fn2737" href="jer.htm#fnB2737"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:15)  The participle here is intended to be connected with "LORD who rules over all" in the preceding verse. The passage is functioning to underline the LORD's power to carry out what he has sworn in contrast to the impotence of their idols who will be put to shame and be dismayed (50:2).<br>
 <a name="fn2738" href="jer.htm#fnB2738"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:19)  <i>Heb</i> "For he is the former of all [things] and the tribe of his inheritance." This is the major exception to the verbatim repetition of 10:12-16 in 51:15-19. The word "Israel" appears before "the tribe of his inheritance" in 10:16. It is also found in a number of Hebrew MSS, in the Lucianic recension of the LXX (the Greek version), the Aramaic Targums, and the Latin Vulgate. Most translations and many commentaries assume it here. However, it is easier to explain why the word is added in a few of the versions and some Hebrew than to explain why it was left out. It is probable that the word is not original here because the addressees are different and the function of this hymnic piece is slightly different (see the study note on the next line for details). Here it makes good sense to understand that the LORD is being called the creator of the special tribe of people he claims as his own property (see the study note on the first line of 10:16).<br>
 <a name="fn2739" href="jer.htm#fnB2739"><sup>45</sup></a><b>sn</b> (51:19)  With the major exception discussed in the translator's note on the preceding line vv. 15-19 are a verbatim repetition of 10:12-16 with a few minor variations in spelling. There the passage was at the end of a section in which the LORD was addressing the Judeans and trying to convince them that the worship of idols was vain--the idols were impotent but he is all powerful. Here the passage follows a solemn oath by the LORD who rules over all and is apparently directed to the Babylonians, emphasizing the power of the LORD to carry out his oath.<br>
 <a name="fn2740" href="jer.htm#fnB2740"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:20)  Or "Media." The referent is not identified in the text; the text merely says "you are my war club." Commentators in general identify the referent as Babylon because Babylon has been referred to as a hammer in 50:23 and Babylon is referred to in v. 25 as a "destroying mountain" (compare v. 20d). However, S. R. Driver, <i>The Book of the Prophet Jeremiah</i>, p. 317, fn c maintains that v. 24 speaks against this. It does seem a little inconsistent to render the <i>vav</i> consecutive perfect at the beginning of v. 24 as future while rendering those in vv. 20b-23 as customary past. However, change in person from second masculine singular (vv. 20b-23) to the second masculine plural in "before your very eyes" and its position at the end of the verse after "which they did in Zion" argue that a change in address occurs there. Driver has to ignore the change in person and take "before your eyes" with the verb "repay" at the beginning to maintain the kind of consistency he seeks. The <i>vav</i> consecutive imperfect can be used for either the customary past (GKC &#167;112.<i>dd</i> with cross reference back to &#167;112.<i>e</i>) or the future (GKC &#167;112.<i>x</i>). Hence the present translation has followed the majority of commentaries (and translations like TEV, NCV, CEV, NIrV) in understanding the referent as Babylon and v. 24 being a transition to vv. 25-26 (cf., e.g., J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i>, pp. 356-57 and J. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i>, pp. 756-57). If the referent is understood as Media then the verbs in vv. 20-23 should all be translated as futures. See also the translator's note on v. 24.<br>

BDB 688 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/g&#180;s*</FONT> gives "prefect, ruler" as the basic definition for the second term but neither works very well in a modern translation because "prefect" would be unknown to most readers and "ruler" would suggest someone along the lines of a king, which these officials were not. The present translation has chosen "leaders" by default, assuming there is no other term that would be any more appropriate in light of the defects noted in "prefect" and "ruler."<br>
 <a name="fn2745" href="jer.htm#fnB2745"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:24)  Or "Media, you are my war club...I will use you to smash...leaders. So before your very eyes I will repay...for all the wicked things they did in Zion." For explanation see the translator's note on v. 20. The position of the phrase "before your eyes" at the end of the verse after "which they did in Zion" and the change in person from second masculine singular in vv. 20b-23 ("I used you to smite") to second masculine plural in "before your eyes" argue that a change in referent/addressee occurs in this verse. To maintain that the referent in vv. 20-23 is Media/Cyrus requires that this position and change in person be ignored; "before your eyes" then is attached to "I will repay." The present translation follows J. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 757 and F. B. Huey, <i>Jeremiah-Lamentations</i>, p. 423 in seeing the referent as the Judeans who had witnessed the destruction of Zion/Jerusalem. The word "Judean" has been supplied for the sake of identifying the referent for the modern reader.<br>

I will reach out my hand against you and roll you down from the cliffs and make you a mountain of burning." The interpretation adopted here follows the lines suggested by S. R. Driver, <i>The Book of the Prophet Jeremiah</i>, p. 318, fn c and reflected also in BDB 977 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hp*r}c=</FONT>. Babylon is addressed as a destructive mountain because it is being compared to a volcano. The LORD, however, will make it a "burned-out mountain," i.e., an extinct volcano which is barren and desolate. This interpretation seems to this translator to fit the details of the text more consistently than alternative ones which separate the concept of "destroying/destructive" from "mountain" and explain the figure of the mountain to refer to the dominating political position of Babylon and the reference to a "mountain of burning" to be a "burned [or, burned over] mountain." The use of similes in place of metaphors makes it easier for the modern reader to understand the figures and also more easily incorporates the dissonant figure of "rolling you down from the cliffs" which involves the figure of personification.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (51:25)  The figure here involves comparing Babylon to a destructive volcano which the LORD makes burned-out, i.e., he will destroy her power to destroy. The figure of personification is also involved because the LORD is said to roll her off the cliffs; that would not be applicable to a mountain.<br>
 <a name="fn2751" href="jer.htm#fnB2751"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:26)  This is a fairly literal translation of the original which reads "No one will take from you a stone for a cornerstone nor a stone for foundations." There is no unanimity of opinion in the commentaries, many feeling that the figure of the burned mountain continues and others feeling that the figure here shifts to a burned city whose stones are so burned that they are useless to be used in building. The latter is the interpretation adopted here (see, e.g., F. B. Huey, <i>Jeremiah-Lamentations</i>, p. 423, W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 2:426 and the translation in NCV).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (51:26)  The figure here shifts to that of a burned-up city whose stones cannot be used for building. Babylon will become a permanent heap of ruins.<br>

According to BDB 651 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">sn}</FONT> 1, the raising of a standard was a signal of a war--a summons to assemble and attack (see usage in Isa 5:26; 13:2; Jer 51:12). The "blowing of the ram's horn" was also a signal to rally behind a leader and join in an attack (see Judg 3:27; 6:34). For the meaning of "consecrate nations against her" see the study note on 6:4. The usage of this phrase goes back to the concept of holy war where soldiers had to be consecrated for battle by the offering of a sacrifice. The phrase has probably lost its ritual usage in later times and become idiomatic for making necessary preparations for war.<br>

The Medes were the dominant country in this region from around 590 B.C. until they were conquered and incorporated into the Persian empire by Cyrus in 550 B.C.<br>
 <a name="fn2755" href="jer.htm#fnB2755"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:27)  The translation of this line is uncertain because it includes a word which only occurs here and in Nah 3:17 where it is found in parallelism with a word that is only used once and whose meaning in turn is uncertain. It is probably related to the Akkadian word <i>tupsharru </i>which refers to a scribe (<i>Heb</i> "a tablet writer"). The exact function of this official is disputed. KBL 356 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rs*p=f!</FONT> relates it to a "recruiting officer," a sense which is reflected in NAB. The majority of modern translations render "commander" or "marshal" following the suggestion of BDB 381 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rs*p=f!</FONT>. Keown, Scalise, Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i>,<i> </i>p. 351 translate "recruiter(scribe)" but explain the function on p. 371 as that of recording the plunder captured in war.

 <a name="fn2756" href="jer.htm#fnB2756"><sup>62</sup></a><b>sn</b> (51:27)  This is probably a poetic or shorthand way of referring to the cavalry and chariotry where horse is put for "rider" and "driver."<br>
 <a name="fn2757" href="jer.htm#fnB2757"><sup>63</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:27)  <i>Heb</i> "Bring up horses like bristly locusts." The meaning of the Hebrew word "bristly" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rm*s*</FONT>) is uncertain because the word only occurs here. It is generally related to a verb meaning "to bristle" which occurs in Job 4:15 and Ps 119:20. Exactly what is meant by "bristly" in connection with "locust" is uncertain, though most relate it to a stage of the locust in which its wings are still encased in a rough, horny casing. J. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 759 adds that this is when the locust is very destructive. However, no other commentary mentions this. Therefore the present translation omits the word because it is of uncertain meaning and significance. For a fuller discussion of the way the word has been rendered see W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 2:427.<br>
 <a name="fn2758" href="jer.htm#fnB2758"><sup>64</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:28)  See the first translator's note on 51:27 and compare also 6:4 and the study note there.<br>

 <a name="fn2760" href="jer.htm#fnB2760"><sup>66</sup></a><b>tc</b> (51:28)  The Hebrew text has a confusing switch of possessive pronouns in this verse: "Consecrate the nations against her, the kings of the Medes, her governors and prefects, and all the land of his dominion." This has led to a number of different resolutions. The LXX (the Greek version) renders the word "kings" as singular and levels all the pronouns to "his," paraphrasing the final clause and combining it with "king of the Medes" to read "and of all the earth." The Latin Vulgate levels them all to the third masculine plural, and this is followed by the present translation as well as a number of other modern translations (NASB, NIV, NRSV, TEV, NCV). The ASV and NJPS understand the feminine to refer to Media, i.e., "her governors and all her prefects" and understand the masculine in the last line to be a distributive singular referring back to the lands each of the governors and prefects ruled over. This is probably correct but since governors and prefects refer to officials appointed over provinces and vassal states it amounts to much the same interpretation that the Latin Vulgate, the present translation, and other modern translations have given.<br>
 <a name="fn2761" href="jer.htm#fnB2761"><sup>67</sup></a><b>sn</b> (51:29)  The figure here is common in the poetic tradition of the LORD going forth to do battle against his foes and the earth's reaction to it is compared to a person trembling with fear and writhing in agony, agony like that of a woman in labor (cf. Judg 5:4; Nah 1:2-5; Hab 3:1-15 [especially v. 6]).<br>

The verb in v. 31a, however, is imperfect, viewing the action as future; the perfects that follow are all dependent on that future. Verse 33 looks forward to a time when Babylon will be harvested and trampled like grain on the threshing floor and the imperatives imply a time in the future. Hence the present translation has rendered all the verbs in vv. 29-30 as future.<br>

This is still a part of the report of the messengers. The meaning of the word translated "reed marshes" has seemed inappropriate to some commentators because it elsewhere refers to "pools." However, all the commentaries consulted agree that the word here refers to the reedy marshes that surrounded Babylon. (For a fuller discussion regarding the meaning of this word and attempts to connect it with a word meaning "fortress" see W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 2:427.)<br>
 <b>sn</b> (51:32)  Babylon was a city covering over a thousand acres. The city itself was surrounded by two walls, the inner one 21 feet (6.3 m) thick and the outer 11 feet (3.3 m) thick. To provide further security, walls were built to the south and east of the city and irrigation ditches and canals north and east of the city were flooded to prevent direct access to the city. The reference to "fords" here is to the river crossings of the Euphrates River which ran right through the city and the crossings at the ditches and canals. The reference to the "reed marshes" refers to the low lying areas around the city where reeds grew. The burning of the reed marshes would deprive any fugitives of places to hide and flush out any who had already escaped.<br>

Yet a little while and the time of the harvest will come for her." It is generally agreed that there are two figures here: one of leveling the threshing floor and stamping it into a smooth, hard surface and the other of the harvest where the grain is cut, taken to the threshing floor, and threshed by trampling the sheaves of grain to loosen the grain from the straw, and finally winnowed by throwing the mixture into the air (cf., e.g., J Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 760). The translation has sought to convey those ideas as clearly as possible without digressing too far from the literal.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (51:33)  There are two figures involved here: one of the threshing floor being leveled and stamped down hard and smooth and the other of the harvest. At harvest time the stalks of grain were cut down, gathered in sheaves, taken to the harvest floor where the grain was loosened from the husk by driving oxen and threshing sleds over them. The grain was then separated from the mixture of grain, straw and husks by repeatedly throwing it in the air and letting the wind blow away the lighter husks and ground-up straw. The figure of harvest is often used of judgment in the OT. See, e.g., Joel 3:13 (4:13 Hebrew text) and Hos 6:11 and compare also Mic 4:12-13 and Jer 51:2 where different steps in this process are also used figuratively in connection with judgment. Babylon will be leveled to the ground and its people cut down in judgment.<br>
 <a name="fn2772" href="jer.htm#fnB2772"><sup>78</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:34)  This verse is extremely difficult to translate because of the shifting imagery, the confusion over the meaning of one of the verbs, and the apparent inconsistency of the pronominal suffixes here with those in the following verse which everyone agrees is connected with it. The pronominal suffixes are first common plural but the versions all read them as first common singular which the Masoretes also do in the Qere. That reading has been followed here for consistency with the next verse which identifies the speaker as the person living in Zion and the personified city of Jerusalem. The Hebrew text reads: "Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon devoured me [cf. 50:7, 17] and threw me into confusion. He set me down an empty dish. He swallowed me like a monster from the deep [cf. BDB 1072 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/yN]T^</FONT> 3 and compare usage in Isa 27:1; Ezek 29:3; 32:2]. He filled his belly with my dainties. He rinsed me out [cf. BDB s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jWD</FONT> Hiph 2 and compare the usage in Isa 4:4]." The verb "throw into confusion" has proved troublesome because its normal meaning does not seem appropriate. Hence various proposals have been made to understand it in a different sense. The present translation has followed W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 2:428 in understanding the verb to mean "disperse" or "route" (see NAB). The last line has seemed out of place and has often been emended to read "he has spewed me out" (so NIV, NRSV, a reading that presupposes <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn]j*yD]h!</FONT> for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn]j*yd]h$</FONT>). The reading of the Masoretic Text is not inappropriate if it is combined with the imagery of an empty jar and hence is retained here (see F. B. Huey, <i>Jeremiah-Lamentations</i>, p. 425, fn 59, H. Freedman, <i>Jeremiah</i>, p. 344 and NJPS). The lines have been combined to keep the imagery together.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (51:34)  The speaker in this verse and the next is the personified city of Jerusalem. She laments her fate at the hands of the king of Babylon and calls down a curse on Babylon and the people who live in Babylonia. Here Nebuchadnezzar is depicted as a monster of the deep who has devoured Jerusalem, swallowed her down, and filled its belly with her riches, leaving her an empty dish, which has been rinsed clean.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (51:36)  The reference to <i>their sea</i> is not clear. Most interpreters understand it to be a figurative reference to the rivers and canals surrounding Babylon. But some feel it refers to the reservoir that the wife of Nebuchadnezzar, Queen Nictoris, had made.<br>

That appears to be the verb that the LXX (the Greek version) was reading when they translated <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">karwqwsi</FONT> which means "they will be stupefied."

 <a name="fn2781" href="jer.htm#fnB2781"><sup>87</sup></a><b>sn</b> (51:39)  The central figure here is the figure of the cup of the LORD's wrath (cf. 25:15-29, especially v. 26). Here the Babylonians have been made to drink so deeply of it that they fall into a drunken sleep from which they will never wake up (i.e., they die, death being compared to sleep [cf. Ps 13:3 (13:4 HT); 76:5 (76:6 HT); 90:5]). Compare the usage in Jer 51:57 for this same figure.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (51:40)  This statement is highly ironic in light of the fact that the Babylonians were compared to lions and lion cubs (v. 38). Here they are like lambs, rams, and male goats which are to be lead off to be slaughtered.<br>
 <a name="fn2784" href="jer.htm#fnB2784"><sup>90</sup></a><b>sn</b> (51:41)  <i>Heb</i> "Sheshach." For an explanation of the usage of this name for Babylon see the study note on Jer 25:26 and that on 51:1 for a similar phenomenon. Babylon is here called "the pride of the whole earth" because it was renowned for its size, its fortifications, and its beautiful buildings.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (51:41)  This is part of a taunt song (see Isa 14:4) and assumes prophetically that the city has already been captured. The verbs in vv. 41-43a are all in the Hebrew tense that the prophets often use to look at the future as "a done deal" (the so-called prophetic perfect). In v. 44 which is still a part of this picture the verbs are in the future. The Hebrew tense has been retained here and in vv. 42-43 but it should be remembered that the standpoint is prophetic and future.<br>
 <a name="fn2786" href="jer.htm#fnB2786"><sup>92</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:42)  For the meaning "multitude" here rather than "tumult" see BDB 242 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/omh*</FONT> 3.c, where reference is made that this refers to a great throng of people under the figure of an overwhelming mass of waves. The word is used of a multitude of soldiers, or a vast army in 1 Sam 14:16; 1 Kgs 20:13, 18 (cf. BDB 242 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/omh*</FONT> 3.a for further references).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (51:42)  This is a poetic and figurative reference to the enemies of Babylon, the foe from the north (see 50:3, 9, 51:27-28), which has attacked Babylon in wave after wave. This same figure is used in Isa 17:12. In Isa 8:7-8 the king of Assyria (and his troops) are compared to the Euphrates which rises up and floods over the whole land of Israel and Judah. This same figure, but with application to Babylon, is assumed in Jer 47:2-3. In Jer 46:7-8 the same figure is employed in a taunt of Egypt which had boasted that it would cover the earth like the flooding of the Nile.<br>

Here the present translation has followed the suggestion of <i>BHS</i> and a number of the modern commentaries in deleting the second occurrence of the word "land," in which case the words that follow are not a relative clause but independent statements. A number of modern translations appear to ignore the third feminine plural suffixes which refer back to the cities and refer the statements that follow to the land.<br>

Yea, the walls of Babylon have fallen." The verbs in the first two lines are <i>vav</i> consecutive perfects and the verb in the third line is an imperfect all looking at the future. That indicates that the perfect that follows and the perfects that precede are all prophetic perfects. The translation adopted seemed to be the best way to make the transition from the pasts which were adopted in conjunction with the taunting use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Eya@</FONT> in v. 41 to the futures in v. 44. For the usage of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;G~</FONT> to indicate a climax, "yea" or "indeed" see BDB 169 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;G~</FONT> 3. It seemed to be impossible to render the meaning of v. 44 in any comprehensible way, even in a paraphrase.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (51:44)  In the ancient Near East the victory of a nation over another nation was attributed to its gods. The reference is a poetic way of referring to the fact that God will be victorious over Babylon and its chief god, Bel/Marduk (see the study note on 50:2 for explanation). The reference to the disgorging of what Bel had swallowed is to captured people and plundered loot that had been taken to Babylon under the auspices of the victory of Bel over the foreign god (cf. Dan 5:2-4). The plundered treasures and captive people will be set free and nations will no longer have to pay homage to him because Babylon will be destroyed. <br>

 <a name="fn2791" href="jer.htm#fnB2791"><sup>97</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:47)  <i>Heb</i> "That being so, look, days are approaching." <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/k@l*</FONT> often introduces the effect of an action. That may be the case here, the turmoil outlined in v. 46 serving as the catalyst for the culminating divine judgment described in v. 47. Another possibility is that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/k@l* </FONT>here has an asseverative force ("certainly"), as in Isa 26:14 and perhaps Jer 5:2 (see the note there). In this case the word almost has the force of "for, since," because it presents a cause for an accompanying effect. See Judg 8:7 and the discussion of Isa 26:14 in BDB 487. <br>
