 <b>tn </b> (1:1) <i>Heb </i>"The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:1)  Isaiah's prophetic career probably began in the final year of Uzziah's reign (c. 740 B.C., see Isa 6:1) and extended into the later years of Hezekiah's reign, which ended in 686 B.C. <br>
 <a name="fn1" href="isa.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:2)  The personified <i>heavens</i> and <i>earth</i> are summoned to God's courtroom as witnesses against God's covenant people. Long before this Moses warned the people that the heavens and earth would be watching their actions (see Deut 4:26; 30:19; 31:28; 32:1).<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="isa.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:2) Or, "sons."<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="isa.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:3) <i>Heb </i>"and the donkey the feeding trough of its owner." The verb in the first line does double duty in the parallelism.<br>
 <a name="fn4" href="isa.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  The Hebrew text has no object, but the parallelism suggests that Israel fails to recognize the LORD as the one who provides for their needs.<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="isa.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:4)  Having summoned the witnesses and announced the LORD's accusation against Israel, Isaiah mourns the nation's impending doom. The third person references to the LORD in the second half of the verse suggest that the quotation from the LORD (cf. vv. 2-3) has concluded.<br>
 <a name="fn6" href="isa.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:4) <i>Heb </i>"Woe [to the] sinful nation." The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ywh</FONT>, "woe, ah," was used in funeral laments (see 1 Kgs 13:30; Jer 22:18; 34:5) and carries the connotation of death. In highly dramatic fashion the prophet acts out Israel's funeral in advance, emphasizing that their demise is inevitable if they do not repent soon.<br>
 <a name="fn7" href="isa.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:4) Or, "sons."<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="isa.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:4) <i>Heb </i>"the Holy One of Israel." This is one of Isaiah's favorite divine titles for God. It pictures the LORD as the sovereign king who rules over his covenant people and exercises moral authority over them. See the note at Isa 6:3.<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="isa.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:4) <i>Heb </i>"they are estranged backward." The LXX omits this statement, which presents syntactical problems and seems to be outside the synonymous parallelistic structure of the verse.<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="isa.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:5)  In vv. 5-9 Isaiah addresses the battered nation (5-8) and speaks as their representative (9). <br>
 <a name="fn11" href="isa.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:5) <i>Heb </i>"Why are you still beaten? [Why] do you continue rebellion?" The rhetorical questions express the prophet's disbelief over Israel's apparent masochism and obsession with sin. The interrogative construction in the first line does double duty in the parallelism. <br>
 <a name="fn12" href="isa.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:5) <i>Heb </i>"all the head is ill."<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="isa.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:5) <i>Heb </i>"and all the heart is faint." The "heart" here stands for bodily strength and energy, as suggested by the context and usage elsewhere (see Jer 8:18; Lam 1:22).<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="isa.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:6) <i>Heb </i>"there is not in it health."<br>
 <a name="fn15" href="isa.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:6) <i>Heb </i>"pressed out."<br>
 <a name="fn16" href="isa.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:6) <i>Heb </i>"softened."<br>
 <a name="fn17" href="isa.htm#fnB17"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:7) <i>Heb </i>"As for your land, before you foreigners are devouring it."<br>
 <a name="fn18" href="isa.htm#fnB18"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:7) <i>Heb </i>"and [there is] devastation like an overthrow by foreigners." The comparative preposition (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">k</FONT>) has here the rhetorical nuance, "in every way like." The point is that the land has all the earmarks of a destructive foreign invasion because that is what has indeed happened. One could paraphrase, "it is desolate as it can only be when foreigners destroy." On this use of the preposition in general, see GKC &#167;118.<i>x</i>. Many also prefer to emend "foreigners" here to "Sodom," though there is no external attestation for such a reading in the MSS or ancient versions. Such an emendation finds support from the following context (vv. 9-10) and usage of the preceding noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkphm</FONT>, "overthrow." In its five other uses, this noun is associated with the destruction of Sodom. If one accepts the emendation, then one might translate, "the devastation resembles the destruction of Sodom." <br>
 <a name="fn19" href="isa.htm#fnB19"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:8) <i>Heb </i>"daughter of Zion." The genitive is appositional, identifying precisely which daughter is in view. By picturing Zion as a daughter, the prophet emphasizes her helplessness and vulnerability before the enemy.<br>
 <a name="fn20" href="isa.htm#fnB20"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:8) <i>Heb </i>"like a city besieged." This third comparison identifies the reality, unlike the preceding two, which are purely metaphorical. In this case the comparative preposition, as in v. 7b, has the force, "in every way like," indicating that all the earmarks of a siege are visible because that is indeed what is taking place. The verb form in MT is Qal passive participle of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rxn</FONT>, "guard," but since this verb is not often used of a siege (see BDB 666), some prefer to repoint the form as a Niphal participle from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rwx</FONT>, "besiege." However, the latter is not attested elsewhere in the Niphal (see BDB 848).<br>
 <a name="fn21" href="isa.htm#fnB21"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  Traditionally, "the LORD of hosts." The title pictures God as the sovereign king who has at his disposal a multitude of attendants, messengers, and warriors to do his bidding. In some contexts, like this one, the military dimension of his rulership is highlighted. In this case, the title pictures him as one who leads armies into battle against his enemies.<br>
 <a name="fn22" href="isa.htm#fnB22"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:9)  The translation assumes that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">fumk</FONT>, "quickly" (literally, "like a little") goes with what follows, contrary to the MT accents, which take it with what precedes. In this case, one could translate the preceding line, "If the LORD who leads armies had not left us a few survivors."<br>
 <a name="fn23" href="isa.htm#fnB23"><sup>24</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:10)  Building on the simile of v. 9, the prophet sarcastically addresses the leaders and people of Jerusalem as if they were leaders and residents of ancient Sodom and Gomorrah. The sarcasm is appropriate, for if the judgment is comparable to Sodom's, that must mean that the sin which prompted the judgment is comparable as well. <br>
 <a name="fn24" href="isa.htm#fnB24"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:10) <i>Heb </i>"to the instruction of our God." In this context, which is highly accusatory and threatening, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrwt</FONT>, "law, instruction," does not refer to mere teaching, but to corrective teaching and rebuke.<br>
 <a name="fn25" href="isa.htm#fnB25"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:11) <i>Heb </i>"Why to me the multitude of your sacrifices?" The sarcastic rhetorical question suggests that their many sacrifices are of no importance to the LORD. <br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:11)  In this section the LORD refutes a potential objection that his sinful people might offer in their defense. He has charged them with rebellion (vv. 2-3), but they might respond that they have brought him many sacrifices. So he points out that he requires social justice first and foremost, not empty ritual.<br>
 <a name="fn26" href="isa.htm#fnB26"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ubc</FONT>, "be satisfied, full," is often used of eating and/or drinking one's fill. See BDB 959. Here sacrifices are viewed, in typical ancient Near Eastern fashion, as food for the deity. God here declares that he has eaten and drunk, as it were, his fill.<br>
 <a name="fn27" href="isa.htm#fnB27"><sup>28</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:11)  In the chiastic structure of the verse the verbs at the beginning and end highlight God's displeasure, while the heaping up of references to animals, fat, and blood in the middle lines hints at why God wants no more of their sacrifices. They have, as it were, piled the food on his table and he needs no more.<br>
 <a name="fn28" href="isa.htm#fnB28"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:12) <i>Heb </i>"When you come to appear before me, who requires this from your hand, trampling of my courtyards?" The rhetorical question sarcastically makes the point that God does not require this parade of livestock. The verb "trample" probably refers to the eager worshipers and their sacrificial animals walking around in the temple area. <br>
 <a name="fn29" href="isa.htm#fnB29"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:13) Or, "empty, worthless."<br>
 <a name="fn30" href="isa.htm#fnB30"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:13) <i>Heb </i>"sin and assembly." The point is that their attempts at worship are unacceptable to God because the people's everyday actions in the socio-economic realm prove they have no genuine devotion to God (see vv. 16-17). <br>
 <a name="fn31" href="isa.htm#fnB31"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:15) <i>Heb </i>"I close my eyes from you."<br>
 <a name="fn32" href="isa.htm#fnB32"><sup>33</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:15)  Not just the blood of sacrificial animals, but also the blood, as it were, of their innocent victims. By depriving the poor and destitute of proper legal recourse and adequate access to the economic system, the oppressors have, for all intents and purposes, "killed" their victims. <br>
 <a name="fn33" href="isa.htm#fnB33"><sup>34</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:16)  Having demonstrated the people's guilt, the LORD calls them to repentance, which will involve concrete action in the socio-economic realm, not mere emotion. <br>
 <a name="fn34" href="isa.htm#fnB34"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:17)  The precise meaning of this line is uncertain. The translation assumes an emendation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jomj*</FONT>, "oppressor [?]" to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">JWmj*</FONT>, "oppressed" (a passive participle from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jmj</FONT>, "oppress") and takes the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> in the sense of "make happy" (the delocutive Piel, meaning "call/pronounce happy," is metonymic here, referring to actually effecting happiness). The parallelism favors this interpretation, for the next two lines speak of positive actions on behalf of the destitute. The other option is to retain the MT pointing and translate, "set right the oppressor," but the nuance "set right" is not attested elsewhere for the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT>. <br>
 <a name="fn35" href="isa.htm#fnB35"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:17)  This word refers to a woman who has lost her husband, by death or divorce. The orphan and widow are often mentioned in the OT as epitomizing the helpless and impoverished who have been left without the necessities of life due to the loss of a family provider. <br>
 <a name="fn36" href="isa.htm#fnB36"><sup>37</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:18)  The LORD concludes his case against Israel by offering them the opportunity to be forgiven and by setting before them the alternatives of renewed blessing (as a reward for repentance) and final judgment (as punishment for persistence in sin).<br>
 <a name="fn37" href="isa.htm#fnB37"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:18)  Traditionally, "let us reason together," but the context suggests a judicial nuance. The LORD is giving the nation its options for the future.<br>
 <a name="fn38" href="isa.htm#fnB38"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:18)  The imperfects must be translated as modal (indicating capability or possibility) to bring out the conditional nature of the offer. This purification will only occur if the people repent and change their ways.<br>
 <a name="fn39" href="isa.htm#fnB39"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:18)  The imperfects must be translated as modal (indicating capability or possibility) to bring out the conditional nature of the offer. This purification will only occur if the people repent and change their ways.<br>
 <a name="fn40" href="isa.htm#fnB40"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:18) <i>Heb </i>"though your sins are like red, they will become white like snow; though they are red like scarlet, they will be like wool." The point is not that the sins will be covered up, though still retained. The metaphorical language must be allowed some flexibility and should not be pressed into a rigid literalistic mold. The people's sins will be removed and replaced by ethical purity. The sins that are now as obvious as the color red will be washed away and the ones who are sinful will be transformed. <br>
 <a name="fn41" href="isa.htm#fnB41"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:19) <i>Heb </i>"listen."<br>
 <a name="fn42" href="isa.htm#fnB42"><sup>43</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:20)  The wordplay in the Hebrew draws attention to the options. The people can obey, in which case they will "eat" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wlkat</FONT>, Qal active of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lka</FONT>) God's blessing, or they can disobey, in which case they will be devoured (<i>Heb</i> "eaten," <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wlkat</FONT>, Qal passive/Pual of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lka</FONT>) by God's judgment.<br>
 <a name="fn43" href="isa.htm#fnB43"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:20) <i>Heb </i>"for the mouth of the LORD has spoken." The introductory <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk</FONT> may be asseverative (as reflected in the translation) or causal/explanatory, explaining why the option chosen by the people will become reality (it is guaranteed by the divine word). <br>
 <a name="fn44" href="isa.htm#fnB44"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:21) <i>Heb </i>"How she has become a prostitute, the faithful city!" The exclamatory <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkya</FONT>, "how!" is used several times as the beginning of a lament (see Lam 1:1; 2;1; 4:1-2). <br>
 <a name="fn45" href="isa.htm#fnB45"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:21) <i>Heb </i>"filled with."<br>
 <a name="fn46" href="isa.htm#fnB46"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:21)  Or, "assassins." This refers to the oppressive rich and/or their henchmen.<br>
 <a name="fn47" href="isa.htm#fnB47"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:22)  The pronoun is feminine singular; personified Jerusalem (see v. 21) is addressed.<br>
 <a name="fn48" href="isa.htm#fnB48"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:22)  Or, "dross." The word refers to the refuse of melted metal.<br>
 <a name="fn49" href="isa.htm#fnB49"><sup>50</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:22)  The metaphors of silver becoming impure and beer being watered down picture the moral and ethical degeneration that had occurred in Jerusalem.<br>
 <a name="fn50" href="isa.htm#fnB50"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:23) Or, "stubborn."<br>
 <a name="fn51" href="isa.htm#fnB51"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:23) <i>Heb </i>"companions of."<br>
 <a name="fn52" href="isa.htm#fnB52"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:23) <i>Heb </i>"pursue."<br>
 <a name="fn53" href="isa.htm#fnB53"><sup>54</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:23)  See the note at v. 17.<br>
 <a name="fn54" href="isa.htm#fnB54"><sup>55</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:23)  The rich oppressors referred to in Isaiah and the other eighth century prophets were not rich capitalists in the modern sense of the word. They were members of the royal military and judicial bureaucracies in Israel and Judah. As these bureaucracies grew, they acquired more and more land and gradually commandeered the economy and legal system. At various administrative levels bribery and graft become commonplace. The common people outside the urban administrative centers were vulnerable to exploitation in such a system, especially those, like widows and orphans, who had lost their family provider through death. Through confiscatory taxation, conscription, excessive interest rates, and other oppressive governmental measures and policies, they were gradually disenfranchised and lost their landed property, and with it, their rights as citizens. The socio-economic equilibrium envisioned in the law of Moses was radically disturbed. To read further on this subject see J. A. Dearman, <i>Property Rights in the Eighth-Century Prophets</i>, and C. J. Wright, <i>God's People in God's Land: Family, Land, and Property in the Old Testament</i>.<br>
 <a name="fn55" href="isa.htm#fnB55"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:24) <i>Heb </i>"the master, the LORD of hosts." On the title "LORD of hosts," see the note at v. 9. <br>
 <a name="fn56" href="isa.htm#fnB56"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:24) <i>Heb </i>"the powerful [one] of Israel." <br>
 <a name="fn57" href="isa.htm#fnB57"><sup>58</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:24) <i>Heb </i>"console myself" (i.e., by getting revenge).<br>
 <a name="fn58" href="isa.htm#fnB58"><sup>59</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:24)  The LORD here identifies with the oppressed and comes as their defender and vindicator.<br>
 <a name="fn59" href="isa.htm#fnB59"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:25) <i>Heb </i>"turn my hand against you." The second person pronouns in vv. 25-26 are feminine singular. Personified Jerusalem is addressed. The idiom "turn the hand against" has the nuance of "strike with the hand, attack," in Ps 81:15 (14 ET); Ezek 38:12; Am 1:8; Zech 13:7. In Jer 6:9 it is used of gleaning grapes. <br>
 <a name="fn60" href="isa.htm#fnB60"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:25) <i>Heb </i>"I will purify your dross as [with] flux." "Flux" refers here to minerals added to the metals in a furnace to prevent oxides from forming. For this interpretation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rb</FONT>, see <i>HALOT</i> 750 (s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gys</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn61" href="isa.htm#fnB61"><sup>62</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:25)  The metaphor comes from metallurgy; slag is the substance left over after the metallic ore has been refined.<br>
 <a name="fn62" href="isa.htm#fnB62"><sup>63</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:26) <i>Heb </i>"I will restore your judges as in the beginning; and your counselors as in the beginning." In this context, where social injustice and legal corruption are denounced (see v. 23), the "judges" are probably government officials responsible for making legal decisions, while the "advisers" are probably officials who helped the king establish policies. Both offices are also mentioned in 3:2. <br>
 <a name="fn63" href="isa.htm#fnB63"><sup>64</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:27)  The third person reference to the LORD in v. 28 indicates that the prophet is again (see vv. 21-24a) speaking. Since v. 27 is connected to v. 28 by a conjunction, it is likely that the prophet's words begin with v. 27.<br>
 <a name="fn64" href="isa.htm#fnB64"><sup>65</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:27) <i>Heb </i>"Zion will be ransomed with justice." The point seems to be that the reestablishment of Zion as a center of justice will deliver the city from its past humiliation and restore it to a place of prominence (see 2:2-4).<br>
 <a name="fn65" href="isa.htm#fnB65"><sup>66</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:27)  The Hebrew text has, "her repentant ones with fairness" (or perhaps "righteousness"). The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">h*yb#v*</FONT>, as pointed in MT, is a masculine plural Qal participle from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwv</FONT>, "return." Used substantivally, it refers to the "returning (i.e., repentant) ones." However the parallel line (with its allusion to being freed by a ransom payment) suggests that the form be repointed to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Hy&#180;b=v!</FONT>, "her captivity," a reading that has support from the LXX. <br>
 <a name="fn66" href="isa.htm#fnB66"><sup>67</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:28) <i>Heb </i>"and [there will be] a shattering of rebels and sinners together."<br>
 <a name="fn67" href="isa.htm#fnB67"><sup>68</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:29)  The Hebrew text has the third person here, though a few Hebrew MSS read the second person, which is certainly more consistent with the following context. The third person form is the more difficult reading and probably original. The prophet continues his description of the sinners (v. 28), but then suddenly makes a transition to direct address in the middle of his sentence. For other examples of this kind of rhetorical switch in poetry, see GKC &#167;144.<i>p</i>.<br>
 <a name="fn68" href="isa.htm#fnB68"><sup>69</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:29)  The second person pronouns in vv. 29-30 are masculine plural, indicating that the rebellious sinners (v. 28) are addressed.<br>

 <a name="fn73" href="isa.htm#fnB73"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:2) <i>Heb </i>"in the end of the days." This phrase may refer generally to the future, or more technically to the final period of history. See BDB 31.<br>

 <a name="fn75" href="isa.htm#fnB75"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:2) <i>Heb </i>"as the chief of the mountains, and will be lifted up above the hills." The image of Mount Zion being elevated above other mountains and hills pictures the prominence it will attain in the future.<br>
 <a name="fn76" href="isa.htm#fnB76"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:3)  The prefixed verb form with simple <i>vav</i> introduces a purpose/result clause after the preceding prefixed verb form (probably to be taken as a cohortative).<br>
 <a name="fn77" href="isa.htm#fnB77"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:3) <i>Heb </i>"his ways." In this context God's "ways" are the standards of moral conduct he decrees that people should live by.<br>

 <a name="fn83" href="isa.htm#fnB83"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:5) <i>Heb </i>"let's walk in the light of the LORD." In this context, which speaks of the LORD's instruction and commands, the "light of the LORD" refers to his moral standards by which he seeks to guide his people. One could paraphrase, "let's obey the LORD's commands."<br>
 <a name="fn84" href="isa.htm#fnB84"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6)  The words "O LORD" are supplied in the translation for clarification. Isaiah addresses the LORD in prayer.<br>

 <a name="fn86" href="isa.htm#fnB86"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tc </b> (2:6) <i>Heb </i>"they are full from the east." It appears that a word is missing. Based on the parallelism (note "omen readers"), many suggest that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ymswq</FONT>, "diviners," or <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ssqm</FONT>, "divination," has been accidentally omitted. Homoioteleuton could account for the omission of an original <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ymswq</FONT> (note how this word and the following <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;dqm</FONT>, "from the east," both end in <i>mem</i>); an original <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ssqm</FONT> could have fallen out by homoioarcton (note how this word and the following <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;dqm</FONT> both begin with <i>mem</i>). <br>

However, these prefixed verbal forms with <i>vav</i> consecutive appear to carry on the description that precedes and are better taken with the accusation.

The "idols" could be the subject; they will "go" into the caves and holes when the idolaters throw them there in their haste to escape God's judgment (see vv. 20-21). The picture of the idols, which represent the foreign deities worshiped by the people, fleeing from the LORD would be highly polemical and fit the overall mood of the chapter.

The prophet speaks in vv. 1-3 (note the third person reference to the LORD in v. 1), but here the LORD himself announces that he will intervene in judgment. It is unclear where the LORD's words end and the prophet's pick up again. The prophet is apparently speaking again by v. 8, where the LORD is referred to in the third person.

In this case point is the same as in v. 4; the leadership void left by the judgment will be filled by those incompetent to lead the community--children and women.

However, in Isa 4:2 there are no such contextual indicators. To the contrary, in the parallel structure of the verse <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwhy jmx</FONT> corresponds to "produce of the land," a phrase that refers elsewhere exclusively to literal agricultural produce (see Num 13:20, 26; Deut 1:25).

 <b>sn</b> (5:14)  Death is portrayed in both the OT (Prov 1:12; Hab 2:5) and Canaanite myth as voraciously swallowing up its prey. In the myths we read of Death having "a lip to the earth, a lip to the heavens . . . and a tongue to the stars." (J. C. L. Gibson, <i>Canaanite Myths and Legends</i>, 69, text 5 ii 2-3.) Death describes his own appetite as follows: "But my appetite is the appetite of lions in the waste...If it is in very truth my desire to consume `clay' [a reference to his human victims], then in truth by the handfuls I must eat it, whether my seven portions [indicating fullness and completeness] are already in the bowl or whether Nahar [the god of the river responsible for ferrying victims from the land of the living to the land of the dead] has to mix the cup."

The antecedent of the four feminine singular pronominal suffixes used in v. 14b is unclear. The likely referent is personified Zion/Jerusalem (see 3:25-26; 4:4-5). <br>

In this context God's holiness is his sovereign royal authority, which implies a commitment to justice (see the note at 1:4). When he dishes out to the evildoers what they deserve, his sovereignty will be acknowledged.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (5:16)  The appearance of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">fpvm</FONT>, "justice," and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hqdx</FONT>, "fairness" here is rhetorically significant, when one recalls v. 7. There God denounces his people for failing to produce a society where "justice" and "fairness" are valued and maintained. God will judge his people for their failure, taking "justice" and "fairness" into his own hands.<br>

One option would be to translate, "and [amid] the ruins resident aliens will eat fatlings." However, the parallelism is tighter if the second line refers to animals grazing. The translation above assumes an emendation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrg</FONT>, "resident aliens," to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ydg</FONT>, "young goats/sheep" (confusion of <i>daleth</i> and <i>resh</i> is quite common), and understands "fatlings" and "young sheep" (taken as a compound subject or as in apposition) as the subject of the verb. <br>
 <b>sn </b> (5:17) The image completes the picture begun in v. 14 and adds to the irony. When judgment comes, Sheol will eat up the sinners who frequent the feasts; then the banqueting halls will lie in ruins and only sheep will eat there.<br>

Though several textual details are unclear, the basic idea is apparent. The sinners are so attached to their sinful ways (compared here to a heavy load) that they strain to drag them along behind them. If <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">awv</FONT>, "emptiness," is retained, it makes a further comment on their lifestyle, denouncing it as one that is devoid of what is right and destined to lead to nothing but destruction. However, "emptiness" does not form a very tight parallel with "cart" in the next line. The translation above assumes an emendation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">awv</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hc</FONT>, "sheep," and of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlgu</FONT>, "cart," to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lgu</FONT>, "calf." In this case, the verse pictures the sinners pulling sin along behind them as one pulls an animal with a halter. For a discussion of this view, see Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i>, 163, note 1. <br>

The reference to his "work" alludes back to v. 12, which refers to his `work" of judgment. With these words the people challenged the prophet's warning of approaching judgment. They were in essence saying that they saw no evidence that God was about to work in such a way. <br>

 <b>sn</b> (5:21)  Verses 18-21 contain three "woe-saying" that are purely accusatory and have no formal announcement of judgment attached (as in the "woe-sayings" recorded in vv. 8-17). While this lack of symmetry is odd, it has a clear rhetorical purpose. Having established a pattern in vv. 8-17, the prophet deviates from it in vv. 18-21 to grab his audience's attention. By placing the "woes" in rapid succession and heaping up the accusatory elements, he highlights the people's guilt and introduces an element of tension and anticipation. One is reasonably certain that judgment will come, and when it does, it will be devastating. This anticipated devastation is described in frightening detail after the sixth and final woe (see vv. 22-30). <br>
 <a name="fn242" href="isa.htm#fnB242"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:22)  The language used here is quite sarcastic and paves the way for the shocking description of the enemy army in vv. 25-30.

In the latter case one could read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qwjrm ywgl</FONT>, "for a nation from a distance" (see Deut 28:49; Joel 3:8). Another possibility is to emend the text from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qwjrm &lt;ywgl</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qjrmm ywgl</FONT>, "for a nation from a distant place," a phrase which occurs in Jer 5:15.

Elsewhere in the OT the word "seraph" refers to poisonous snakes (Num 21:6; Deut 8:15; Isa 14:29; 30:6). Perhaps they were called "burning ones" because of their appearance or the effect of their venomous bites, which would cause a victim to burn up with fever. It is possible that the seraphs seen by Isaiah were at least partially serpentine in appearance. Though it might seem strange for a snake-like creature to have wings, two of the texts where "seraphs" are snakes describe them as "flying" (Isa 14:29; 30:6), perhaps referring to their darting movements. See the note at 14:29.<br>

 <a name="fn267" href="isa.htm#fnB267"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn </b> (6:3) <i>Heb </i>"Holy, holy, holy [is] the LORD of hosts." Some have seen a reference to the Trinity in the seraphs' threefold declaration, "holy, holy, holy." This proposal has no linguistic or contextual basis and should be dismissed as allegorical. Hebrew sometimes uses repetition for emphasis. (See Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Biblical Hebrew Syntax</i>, 233; and GKC 431-32.) By repeating the word "holy," the seraphs emphasize the degree of the LORD's holiness. For another example of threefold repetition for emphasis, see Ezek 21:27 (Heb. v. 32). (Perhaps Jer 22:29 provides another example.) <br>
 <b>sn</b> (6:3)  The basic sense of the word "holy" is "set apart from that which is commonplace, special, unique." In this context the LORD's holiness is first and foremost his transcendent sovereignty as the ruler of the world. He is "set apart" from the world over which he rules. Note the emphasis on the elevated position of his throne in v. 1 and his designation as "the king" in v. 5. At the same time his holiness encompasses his moral authority, which derives from his royal position. As king he has the right to dictate to his subjects how they are to live; indeed his very own character sets the standard for proper behavior. He is "set apart" from his subjects in a moral sense as well. He sets the standard; they fall short of it. Note that in v. 5 Isaiah laments that he is morally unworthy to be in the king's presence. <br>

 <a name="fn275" href="isa.htm#fnB275"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (6:10)  Do we take this commission at face value? Does the LORD really want to prevent his people from understanding, repenting, and being healed? Verse 9, which ostensibly records the content of Isaiah's message, is clearly ironic. As far as we know, Isaiah did not literally proclaim these exact words. The Hebrew imperatival forms are employed rhetorically and anticipate the response Isaiah will receive. When all is said and done, Isaiah might as well preface and conclude every message with these ironic words, which, though imperatival in form, might be paraphrased as follows: "You continually hear, but don't understand; you continually see, but don't perceive." Isaiah might as well command them to be spiritually insensitive, because, as the preceding and following chapters make clear, the people are bent on that anyway. (This ironic command is comparable to saying to a particularly recalcitrant individual, "Go ahead, be stubborn!") Verse 10b is also clearly sarcastic. On the surface it seems to indicate Isaiah's hardening ministry will prevent genuine repentance. But, as the surrounding chapters clearly reveal, the people were hardly ready or willing to repent. Therefore, Isaiah's preaching was not needed to prevent repentance! Verse 10b reflects the people's attitude and might be paraphrased accordingly: "Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their mind, repent, and be restored, and they certainly wouldn't want that, would they?" Of course, this sarcastic statement may also reveal that the LORD himself is now bent on judgment, not reconciliation. Just as Pharaoh's rejection of Yahweh's ultimatum ignited judgment and foreclosed, at least temporarily, any opportunity for repentance, so the LORD may have come to the point where he has decreed to bring judgment before opening the door for repentance once more. The sarcastic statement in verse 10b would be an emphatic way of making this clear. (Perhaps we could expand our paraphrase: "Otherwise they might...repent, and be restored, and they certainly wouldn't want that, would they? Besides, it's too late for that!") Within this sarcastic framework, verse 10a must also be seen as ironic. As in verse 9 the imperatival forms should be taken as rhetorical and as anticipating the people's response. One might paraphrase: "Your preaching will desensitize the minds of these people, make their hearing dull, and blind their eyes." From the outset the LORD might as well command Isaiah to harden the people, because his preaching will end up having that effect. Despite the use of irony, we should still view this as a genuine, albeit indirect, act of divine hardening. After all, God did not have to send Isaiah. By sending him, he drives the sinful people further from him, for Isaiah's preaching, which focuses on the LORD's covenantal demands and impending judgment upon covenantal rebellion, forces the people to confront their sin and then continues to desensitize them as they respond negatively to the message. As in the case of Pharaoh, Yahweh's hardening is not arbitrarily imposed on a righteous or even morally neutral object. Rather his hardening is an element of his righteous judgment on recalcitrant sinners. Ironically, Israel's rejection of prophetic preaching in turn expedites disciplinary punishment, and brings the battered people to a point where they might be ready for reconciliation. The prophesied judgment (cf. 6:11-13) was fulfilled by 701 B.C. when the Assyrians devastated the land (a situation presupposed by Isa 1:2-20; see especially vv. 4-9). At that time the divine hardening had run its course and Isaiah is able to issue an ultimatum (1:19-20), one which Hezekiah apparently took to heart, resulting in the sparing of Jerusalem (see Isa 36-39 and cf. Jer 26:18-19 with Mic 3:12).This interpretation, which holds in balance both Israel's moral responsibility and the LORD's sovereign work among his people, is consistent with other pertinent texts both within and outside the Book of Isaiah. Isa 3:9 declares that the people of Judah "have brought disaster upon themselves," but Isa 29:9-10 indicates that the LORD was involved to some degree in desensitizing the people. Zech 7:11-12 looks back to the pre-exilic era (cf. v. 7) and observes that the earlier generations stubbornly hardened their hearts, but Ps 81:11-12, recalling this same period, states that the LORD "gave them over to their stubborn hearts."<br>

But elsewhere <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tbxm</FONT> refers to a memorial pillar (2 Sam 18:18) and the word resembles <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbxm</FONT>, "sacred pillar." <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;b</FONT>, "in them," may be a corruption of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmb</FONT>, "high place." (1QIs<sup><sub>a</sub></sup> has <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmb</FONT>.) <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT>, "which," becomes a problem in this case, but one might emend the form to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrvakw</FONT>, "or like an Asherah pole" and translate, "like one of the large sacred trees or an Asherah pole." Though the text is difficult, the references to sacred trees and a sacred pillar suggest that the destruction of a high place is in view, an apt metaphor for the judgment of idolatrous Judah. <br>
 <a name="fn280" href="isa.htm#fnB280"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn </b> (6:13) <i>Heb </i>"a holy offspring [is] its sacred pillar." If <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tbxm</FONT> is taken as "stump," one can see in this statement a brief glimpse of hope. The tree (the nation) is chopped down, but the stump (a righteous remnant) remains from which God can restore the nation. However, if <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tbxm</FONT> is taken as "sacred pillar" (see the previous note), it is much more difficult to take the final statement in a positive sense. In this case "holy offspring" alludes to God's ideal for his covenant people, the offspring of the patriarchs. Ironically that "holy" nation is more like a "sacred pillar" and it will be thrown down like a sacred pillar from a high place and its land destroyed like the sacred trees located at such shrines. Understood in this way, the ironic statement is entirely negative in tone, just like the rest of the preceding announcement of judgment. It also reminds the people of their failure; they did not oppose pagan religion, instead they embraced it. Now they will be destroyed in the same way they should have destroyed paganism. <br>

 <b>sn</b> (7:8)  This statement is problematic for several reasons. It seems to intrude stylistically, interrupting the symmetry of the immediately preceding and following lines. Furthermore, such a long range prophecy lacks punch in the midst of the immediate crisis. After all, even if Israel were destroyed sometime within the next 65 years, a lot could still happen during that time, including the conquest of Judah and the demise of the Davidic family. Finally the significance of the time frame is uncertain. Israel became an Assyrian province within the next 15 years and ceased to exist as a nation. For these reasons many regard the statement as a later insertion, but why a later editor would include the reference to "65 years" remains a mystery. Some try to relate the prophecy to the events alluded to in Ezra 4:2, 10, which refers to how the Assyrian kings Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal settled foreigners in former Israelite territory, perhaps around 670 B.C. However, even if the statement is referring to these events, it lacks rhetorical punch in its immediate context and has the earmarks of a later commentary that has been merged with the text in the process of transmission.<br>
 <a name="fn295" href="isa.htm#fnB295"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn </b> (7:9) <i>Heb </i>"if you do not believe, you will not endure." The verb forms are second plural; the LORD here addresses the entire Davidic family and court. (Verse 4 was addressed to the king.) There is a wordplay in the Hebrew text, designed to draw attention to the alternatives set before the king (cf. 1:20). "Believe" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wnymat</FONT>) is a Hiphil form of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ma</FONT>; "endure" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wnmat</FONT>) is a Niphal form of this same verb.<br>

 <a name="fn302" href="isa.htm#fnB302"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:14)  The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twa</FONT>, "sign," can refer to a miraculous event (see v. 11), but it does not carry this sense inherently. Elsewhere in Isaiah the word usually refers to a natural occurrence or an object/person vested with special significance (see 8:18; 19:20; 20:3; 37:30; 55:13; 66:19). Only in 38:7-8, 22 does it refer to a miraculous deed that involves suspending or overriding natural laws. The sign outlined in vv. 14-17 involves God's providential control over events and their timing, but not necessarily miraculous intervention. <br>
 <a name="fn303" href="isa.htm#fnB303"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn </b> (7:14) <i>Heb </i>"the young woman." The Hebrew article has been rendered as a demonstrative pronoun ("this") in the translation to bring out its force. It is very likely that Isaiah pointed to a woman who was present at the scene of the prophet's interview with Ahaz. Isaiah's address to the "house of David" and his use of second plural forms suggests other people were present, and his use of the second feminine singular verb form ("you will name") later in the verse is best explained if addressed to a woman who is present. <br>
 <a name="fn304" href="isa.htm#fnB304"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:14)  Traditionally, "virgin." Because this verse from Isaiah is quoted in Matt 1:23 in connection with Jesus' birth, the Isaiah passage has been regarded since the earliest Christian times as a prophecy of Christ's virgin birth. Much debate has taken place over the best way to translate this Hebrew term, although ultimately one's view of the doctrine of the virgin birth of Christ is unaffected. Though the Hebrew word used here, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*l=u^</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u^lm*h</FONT>), can sometimes refer to a woman who is a virgin (Gen 24:43), it does not carry this meaning inherently. The word is simply the feminine form of the corresponding masculine noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;l#u#</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u#l#&lt;</FONT>, "young man"; cf. 1 Sam.17:56; 20:22). The Aramaic and Ugaritic cognate terms are both used of women who are not virgins. The word seems to pertain to age, not sexual experience, and would normally be translated "young woman." The LXX translator(s) who later translated the Book of Isaiah into Greek sometime between the second and first century B.C., however, rendered the Hebrew term by the more specific Greek word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">parqevno"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">parqenos</FONT>), which does mean "virgin" in a technical sense. This is the Greek term that also appears in the citation of Isa 7:14 in Matt 1:23. Therefore, regardless of the meaning of the term in the OT context, in the NT Matthew's usage of the Greek term <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">parqevno"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">parqenos</FONT>) clearly indicates that from his perspective a virgin birth has taken place.<br>
 <a name="fn305" href="isa.htm#fnB305"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:14)  Elsewhere the adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrh</FONT>, when used predicatively, refers to a past pregnancy (from the narrator's perspective, 1 Sam 4:19), to a present condition (Gen 16:11; 38:24; 2 Sam 11:5), and to a conception that is about to occur in the near future (Judg 13:5, 7). (There is some uncertainty about the interpretation of Judg 13:5, 7, however. See the notes to those verses.) In Isa 7:14 one could translate, "the young woman is pregnant." In this case the woman is probably a member of the royal family. Another option, the one chosen in the translation above, takes the adjective in an imminent future sense, "the young woman is about to conceive." In this case the woman could be a member of the royal family, or, more likely, the prophetess with whom Isaiah has sexual relations shortly after this (see 8:3). <br>
 <a name="fn306" href="isa.htm#fnB306"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn </b> (7:14) <i>Heb </i>"and you will call his name." The words "young lady" are supplied in the translation to clarify the identity of the addressee. The verb is normally taken as an archaic third feminine singular form here, and translated, "she will call." However the form (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tar&#180;q*</FONT>) is more naturally understood as second feminine singular, in which case the words would be addressed to the young woman mentioned just before this. In the three other occurrences of the third feminine singular perfect of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">arq</FONT> I, "to call," the form used is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ha*r+q*</FONT> (see Gen 29:35; 30:26; 1 Chr 4:9). (A third feminine singular perfect <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tar&#180;q*</FONT> does appear in Deut 31:29 and Jer 44:23, but the verb here is the homonym <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">arq</FONT> II, "to meet, encounter.") The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tar&#180;q*</FONT> (from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">arq</FONT> I, "to call") appears in three other passages (Gen 16:11; Isa 60:18; Jer 3:4 [Qere]) and in each case is second feminine singular.<br>

Most often the construction indicates purpose/result. This sense is preferable here. The following context indicates that sour milk and honey will epitomize the devastation that God's judgment will bring upon the land. Cultivated crops will be gone and the people will be forced to live off the milk produced by their goats and the honey they find in the thickets.

However, the message turns sour in verses 17b-25. God will be with his people in judgment, as well as salvation. The curds and honey will be signs of deprivation, not prosperity, the relief announced in verse 16 will be shortlived, and the new era will be characterized by unprecedented humiliation, not a return to glory. Because of Ahaz's refusal to trust the LORD, potential blessing would be transformed into a curse, just as Isaiah turns an apparent prophecy of salvation into a message of judgment. Because the words "the king of Assyria" are rather awkwardly tacked on to the end of the sentence, some regard them as a later addition. However, the very awkwardness facilitates the prophet's rhetorical strategy here, as he suddenly turns what sounds like a positive message into a judgment speech. Actually, "the king of Assyria," stands in apposition to the earlier object "days," and specifies who the main character of these coming "days" will be.<br>

The metaphors are well chosen, for the Assyrians (symbolized by the bees) were much more powerful and dangerous than the Egyptians (symbolized by the flies). Nevertheless both would put pressure on Judah, for Egypt wanted Judah as a buffer state against Assyrian aggression, while Assyrian wanted it as a base for operations against Egypt. Following the reference to sour milk and honey, the metaphor is especially apt, for flies are attracted to dairy products and bees can be found in the vicinity of honey. <br>

 <b>sn</b> (7:25)  At this point one is able to summarize the content of the "sign" (vv. 14-15) as follows: A young woman known to be present when Isaiah delivered this message to Ahaz (perhaps a member of the royal family or the prophetess mentioned in 8:3) would soon give birth to a boy whom the mother would name Immanuel, "God is with us." Eventually Immanuel would be forced to eat sour milk and honey, which would enable him to make correct moral decisions. How would this situation come about and how would it constitute a sign? Before this situation developed, the Israelites and Syrians would be defeated. But then the LORD would usher in a period of time unlike any since the division of the kingdom almost 200 years before. The Assyrians would overrun the land, destroy the crops, and force the people to subsist on goats' milk and honey. At that time, as the people saw Immanuel eating his sour milk and honey, the Davidic family would be forced to acknowledge that God was indeed with them. He was present with them in the Syrian-Israelite crisis, fully capable of rescuing them; but he was also present with them in judgment, disciplining them for their lack of trust. The moral of the story is quite clear: Failure to appropriate God's promises by faith can turn potential blessing into disciplinary judgment.<br>

In this case <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rhm</FONT> is understood as an infinitive functioning as a verb, the subject of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vj</FONT> is taken as indefinite, and the two nouns are understood as adverbial accusatives.

Another option is to point the prefixed conjunction as a <i>vav</i> consecutive and translate, "So I summoned as witnesses." In this case Isaiah is recalling his response to the LORD's commission.

 <a name="fn343" href="isa.htm#fnB343"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:8)  The appearance of the name Immanuel ("God is with us") is ironic at this point, for God is present with his people in judgment. Immanuel is addressed here as if he has already been born and will see the judgment occur. This makes excellent sense if his birth has just been recorded. There are several reasons for considering Immanuel and Maher-shalal-hash-baz one and the same. 8:3 is a birth account which could easily be understood as recording the fulfillment of the birth prophecy of 7:14. The presence of a formal record/witnesses (8:1-2) suggests a sign function for the child (cf. 7:14). As in 7:14-16, the removal of Judah's enemies would take place before the child reached a specified age (cf. 8:4). Both 7:17-25 and 8:7-8 speak of an Assyrian invasion of Judah which would follow the defeat of Israel/Syria. The major objection to this view is the fact that different names appear, but such a phenomenon is not without parallel in the OT (cf. Gen 35:18). The name Immanuel may emphasize the basic fact of God's presence, while the name Maher focuses on the specific nature of God's involvement. In 7:14 the mother is viewed as naming the child, while in 8:3 Isaiah is instructed to give the child's name, but one might again point to Gen. 35:18 for a precedent. The sign child's age appears to be different in 8:4 than in 7:15-16, but 7:15-16 pertains to the judgment on Judah, as well as the defeat of Israel/Syria (cf. vv. 17-25), while 8:4 deals only with the downfall of Israel/Syria. Some argue that the suffixed form "your land" in 8:8 points to a royal referent (a child of Ahaz or the Messiah), but usage elsewhere shows that the phrase does not need to be so restricted. While the suffix can refer to the king of a land (cf. Num 20:17; 21:22; Deut 2:27; Judg 11:17, 19; 2 Sam 24:13; 1 Kgs 11:22; Isa 14:20), it can also refer to one who is a native of a particular land (cf. Gen 12:1; 32:9; Jon 1:8). (See also the use of "his land" in Isa 13:14 [where the suffix refers to a native of a land] and 37:7 [where it refers to a king].)<br>
 <a name="fn344" href="isa.htm#fnB344"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:9)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wur</FONT> is a Qal imperative, masculine plural from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">uur</FONT>, "break." Elsewhere both transitive (Job 34:24; Ps 2:9; Jer 15:12) and intransitive (Prov 25:19; Jer 11:16) senses are attested for the Qal of this verb. Because no object appears here, the form is likely intransitive, "be broken." In this case the imperative is rhetorical (like "be shattered" later in the verse) and equivalent to a prediction, "you will be broken." On the rhetorical use of the imperative in general, see <i>W-O</i>, 572; GKC &#167;110.<i>c</i>.<br>
 <a name="fn345" href="isa.htm#fnB345"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:9)  The imperatival form (<i>Heb</i> "be shattered") is rhetorical and expresses the speakers' firm conviction of the outcome of the nations' attack. See the note on "be broken."<br>
 <a name="fn346" href="isa.htm#fnB346"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:9)  The initial imperative ("get ready for battle") acknowledges the reality of the nations' hostility; the concluding imperative (<i>Heb</i> "be shattered") is rhetorical and expresses the speakers' firm conviction of the outcome of the nations' attack. (See the note on "be broken.") One could paraphrase, "Okay, go ahead and prepare for battle since that's what you want to do, but your actions will backfire and you'll be shattered." This rhetorical use of the imperatives is comparable to saying to a child who is bent on climbing a high tree, "Okay, go ahead, climb the tree and break your arm!" What this really means is: "Okay, go ahead and climb the tree since that's what you really want to do, but your actions will backfire and you'll break your arm." The repetition of the statement in the final two lines of the verse gives the challenge the flavor of a taunt (ancient Israelite "trash talking," as it were). <br>
 <a name="fn347" href="isa.htm#fnB347"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:10) <i>Heb </i>"speak a word, but it will not stand."<br>
 <a name="fn348" href="isa.htm#fnB348"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:10)  In these vv. 9-10 the tone shifts abruptly from judgment to hope. Hostile nations like Assyria may attack God's people, but eventually they will be destroyed, for God is with his people, sometimes to punish, but ultimately to vindicate. In addition to being a reminder of God's presence in the immediate crisis faced by Ahaz and Judah, Immanuel (whose name is echoed in this concluding statement) was a guarantee of the nation's future greatness in fulfillment of God's covenantal promises. Eventually God would deliver his people from the hostile nations (vv. 9-10) through another child, an ideal Davidic ruler who would embody God's presence in a special way (see 9:6-7). Jesus the Messiah is the fulfillment of the Davidic ideal prophesied by Isaiah, the one whom Immanuel foreshadowed. Through the miracle of the incarnation he is literally "God with us." Matthew realized this and applied Isaiah's ancient prophecy of Immanuel's birth to Jesus (Matt. 1:22-23). The first Immanuel was a reminder to the people of God's presence and a guarantee of a greater child to come who would manifest God's presence in an even greater way. The second Immanuel is "God with us" in a heightened and infinitely superior sense. He "fulfills" Isaiah's Immanuel prophecy by bringing the typology intended by God to realization and by filling out or completing the pattern designed by God. Of course, in the ultimate fulfillment of the type, the incarnate Immanuel's mother must be a virgin, so Matthew uses a Greek term, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">parqevno"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">parqenos</FONT>), which carries that technical meaning (in contrast to the Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*l=u^</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u^lm*h</FONT>), which has the more general meaning "young woman"). Matthew draws similar analogies between NT and OT events in 2:15, 18. The linking of these passages by analogy is termed "fulfillment." In 2:15 God calls Jesus, his perfect Son, out of Egypt, just as he did his son Israel in the days of Moses, an historical event referred to in Hos 11:1. In so doing he makes it clear that Jesus is the ideal Israel prophesied by Isaiah (see Isa 49:3), sent to restore wayward Israel (see Isa 49:5, cf. Matt 1:21). In 2:18 Herod's slaughter of the infants is another illustration of the oppressive treatment of God's people by foreign tyrants. Herod's actions are analogous to those of the Assyrians, who deported the Israelites, causing the personified land to lament as inconsolably as a mother robbed of her little ones (Jer 31:15).<br>

The feminine singular pronominal suffix "her" must refer to the land (cf. vv. 22a, 23b). So one could translate, "Indeed there will be no gloom for the land which was anxious." In this case the statement introduces the positive message to follow. Some assume an emendation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">al</FONT>, "no," to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wl</FONT>, "to him," and of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hl</FONT>, "to her," to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wl</FONT>, "to him," yielding this literal reading, "indeed there is gloom for him, for the one to whom there was anxiety for him." In this case the statement concludes the preceding description of judgment.<br>

 <a name="fn376" href="isa.htm#fnB376"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:23)  The statement probably alludes to the Assyrian conquest of Israel in ca. 734-733 B.C., when Tiglath-pileser III annexed much of Israel's territory and reduced Samaria to a puppet state. <br>
 <a name="fn377" href="isa.htm#fnB377"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:23) <i>Heb </i>Just as in earlier times he humiliated..., [in] the latter times he has brought honor." The main verbs in vv. 1b-4 are Hebrew perfects. The prophet takes his rhetorical stance in the future age of restoration and describes future events as if they have already occurred. To capture the dramatic effect of the original text, the translation uses the English present or present perfect. <br>
 <a name="fn378" href="isa.htm#fnB378"><sup>16</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:23)  These three geographical designations may refer to provinces established by the Assyrians in 734-733 B.C. The "way of the sea" is the province of Dor, along the Mediterranean coast, the "region beyond the Jordan" is the province of Gilead in Transjordan, and "Galilee of the nations" (a title that alludes to how the territory had been overrun by foreigners) is the province of Megiddo located west of the Sea of Galilee. See Y. Aharoni, <i>The Land of the Bible</i>, 374.<br>
 <a name="fn379" href="isa.htm#fnB379"><sup>17</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:1)  The darkness symbolizes judgment and its effects (see 8:22); the light represents deliverance and its effects, brought about by the emergence of a conquering Davidic king (see vv. 3-6).<br>

 <a name="fn381" href="isa.htm#fnB381"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:3)  The LORD is addressed in vv. 3-4.<br>
 <a name="fn382" href="isa.htm#fnB382"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tc </b> (9:3) The Hebrew consonantal text reads, "You multiply the nation, you do not make great the joy." <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">al</FONT>, "not," is obviously incorrect; the marginal reading has <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wl</FONT>, "to him." In this case, one should translate, "You multiply the nation, you increase his (i.e., their) joy." However, the parallelism is tighter if one emends <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wl ywgh</FONT>, "the nation, to him," to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlygh</FONT>, "the joy" (a noun attested in Isa 65:18), which corresponds to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hjmch</FONT>, "the joy," later in the verse.<br>
 <a name="fn383" href="isa.htm#fnB383"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:3) <i>Heb </i>"as they are happy." The word "warriors" is supplied in the translation to clarify the word picture. This last simile comes close to reality, for vv. 4-5 indicate that the people have won a great military victory over their oppressors.<br>
 <a name="fn384" href="isa.htm#fnB384"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:4) <i>Heb </i>"for the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the scepter of the oppressor against him." The singular pronouns are collective, referring to the people. The oppressed nation is compared to an ox weighed down by a heavy yoke and an animal that is prodded and beaten. <br>
 <a name="fn385" href="isa.htm#fnB385"><sup>23</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:4)  This alludes to Gideon's victory over Midian (Judg 7-8), when the LORD delivered Israel from an oppressive foreign invader.<br>

 <a name="fn389" href="isa.htm#fnB389"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:6)  Or, "and dominion was on his shoulders and he called his name." The prefixed verbs with <i>vav</i> consecutive are used with the same rhetorical sense as the perfects in v. 6a. See the preceding note. There is great debate over the syntactical structure of the verse. No subject is indicated for the verb "he called." If all the titles that follow are ones given to the king, then the subject of the verb must be indefinite, "one calls." However, some have suggested that one to three of the titles that follow refer to God, not the king. For example, the traditional punctuation of the Hebrew text suggests the translation, "and the Extraordinary Strategist, the Mighty God calls his name, `Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.'" <br>
 <a name="fn390" href="isa.htm#fnB390"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:6)  Some have seen two titles here ("Wonderful" and "Counselor"). However, the pattern of the following three titles (each contains two elements) and the use of the roots <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">alp</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Juy</FONT> together in Isa 25:1 (cf. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ma hnwma qwjrm twxu alp tycu yk</FONT>) and 28:29 (cf. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hxu aylph</FONT>) suggest otherwise. The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Juwy</FONT> could be taken as appositional (genitive or otherwise) of species ("a wonder, i.e., a wonder as a counselor") or as a substantival participle for which <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">alp</FONT> provides the direct object ("one who counsels wonders"). <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Juwy</FONT> is used as a royal title elsewhere (cf. Mic 4:9). Here it probably refers to the king's ability to devise military strategy, as suggested by the context (cf. vv. 3-4 and the following title <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rwbg la</FONT>). In Isa. 11:2 (also a description of this king) <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hxu</FONT> is linked with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrwbg</FONT> (the latter being typically used of military might, cf. BDB 150). Note also <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmjlml hrwbgw hxu</FONT> in Isa 36:5. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">alp</FONT> is typically used of God (cf. however Lam 1:9). Does this suggest the deity of the messianic ruler? The NT certainly teaches he is God, but did Isaiah necessarily have this in mind over 700 years before his birth? Since Isa 11:2 points out that this king will receive the spirit of the LORD, which will enable him to counsel, it is possible to argue that the king's counsel is "extraordinary" because it finds its source in the divine spirit. Thus this title does not necessarily suggest that the ruler is deity.<br>
 <a name="fn391" href="isa.htm#fnB391"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:6)  <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rwbg</FONT> is probably an attributive adjective ("mighty God"), though one might translate "God is a warrior" or "God is mighty." Since this title is apparently used later (10:21, but cf. Hos. 3:5) for God, some have understood it as pointing to the king's deity. Others argue that the title portrays the king as God's representative on the battlefield, whom God empowers in a supernatural way (see Hayes and Irvine, <i>Isaiah</i>, 181-82). The latter sense seems more likely in the original context of the prophecy. Having read the NT, we might in retrospect interpret this title as indicating the coming king's deity, but it is unlikely that Isaiah or his audience would have understood the title in such a bold way. Ps 45:6 addresses the Davidic king as "God" because he ruled and fought as God's representative on earth. Ancient Near Eastern art and literature picture gods training kings for battle, bestowing special weapons, and intervening in battle. According to Egyptian propaganda, the Hittites described Ramses II as follows: "No man is he who is among us, It is Seth great-of-strength, Baal in person; Not deeds of man are these his doings, They are of one who is unique." (See M. Lichtheim, <i>Ancient Egyptian Literature</i>, 2:67) Isa. 9:6 probably envisions a similar kind of response when friends and foes alike look at the Davidic king in full battle regalia. When the king's enemies oppose him on the battlefield, they are, as it were, fighting against God himself.<br>
 <a name="fn392" href="isa.htm#fnB392"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:6)  This title must not be taken in an anachronistic Trinitarian sense. (To do so would be theologically problematic, for the "Son" is the messianic king and is distinct in his person from God the "Father.") Rather, in its original context the title pictures the king as the protector of his people. For a similar use of "father" see Isa 22:21 and Job 29:16. This figurative, idiomatic use of "father" is not limited to the Bible. In a Phoenician inscription (ca. 850-800 B.C.) the ruler Kilamuwa declares: "To some I was a father, to others I was a mother." In another inscription (ca. 800 B.C.) the ruler Azitawadda boasts that the god Baal made him "a father and a mother" to his people. (See J. Pritchard, <i>ANET</i>, 499-500.) The use of "everlasting" might suggest the deity of the king, but Isaiah and his audience may have understood the term as royal hyperbole emphasizing the king's long reign or enduring dynasty (for examples of such hyperbolic language used of the Davidic king, see 1 Kgs 1:31; Pss 21:4-6; 61:6-7; 72:5, 17). The New Testament indicates that the hyperbolic language (as in the case of the title "Mighty God") is literally realized in the ultimate fulfillment of the prophecy, for Jesus will rule eternally.<br>
 <a name="fn393" href="isa.htm#fnB393"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:6)  This title pictures the king as one who establishes a safe socio-economic environment for his people. It hardly depicts him as a meek individual, for he establishes peace through military strength (as the preceding context and the first two royal titles indicate). His people experience safety and prosperity because their invincible king destroys their enemies. See Pss 72 and 144 for parallels to these themes. <br>
 <a name="fn394" href="isa.htm#fnB394"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tc </b> (9:7) The Hebrew text has <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbr&lt;l</FONT>, which is a corrupt reading. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;l</FONT> is dittographic; note the preceding word, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;wlv</FONT>.

 <a name="fn401" href="isa.htm#fnB401"><sup>39</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:8)  The following speech (9:8-10:4) assumes that God has already sent judgment (see v. 9), but it also announces that further judgment is around the corner (10:1-4). The speech seems to describe a series of past judgments on the northern kingdom which is ready to intensify further in the devastation announced in 10:1-4. It may have been written prior to the Assyrian conquest of the northern kingdom in 734-733 B.C., or sometime between that invasion and the downfall of Samaria in 722 B.C. The structure of the speech displays four panels, each of which ends with the refrain, "Through all this, his anger did not subside; his hand remained outstretched" (9:12b; 17b; 21b; 10:4b): Panel I: (A) Description of past judgment (9:8); (B) Description of the people's attitude toward past judgment (9:9-10); (C) Description of past judgment (9:11-12a); (D) Refrain (9:12b); Panel II: (A) Description of the people's attitude toward past judgment (9:13); (B) Description of past judgment (9:14-17a); (C) Refrain (9:17b); Panel III: (A) Description of past judgment (9:18-21a); (B) Refrain (9:21b); Panel IV: (A) Woe oracle announcing future judgment (10:1-4a); (B) Refrain (10:4b). <br>

Both verbs (perfects) are taken as indicating simple past; the <i>vav</i> on the second verb is understood as a simple <i>vav</i> conjunctive. Another option is to understand the verse as describing a future judgment (see 10:1-4). In this case the first verb is a perfect of certitude; the <i>vav</i> on the second verb is a <i>vav</i> consecutive. <br>
 <a name="fn405" href="isa.htm#fnB405"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:9)  The translation assumes that vv. 9-10 describe the people's response to a past judgment (v. 8). The perfect is understood as indicating simple past and the <i>vav</i> is taken as conjunctive. Another option is to take the <i>vav</i> on the perfect as consecutive and translate, "all the people will know." <br>

 <a name="fn409" href="isa.htm#fnB409"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:11)  The translation assumes that the prefixed verb with <i>vav</i> consecutive continues the narrative of past judgment. <br>
 <a name="fn410" href="isa.htm#fnB410"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tc</b> (9:11)  The Hebrew text reads literally, "adversaries of Rezin against him [i.e., them]." The next verse describes how the Syrians (over whom Rezin ruled, see 7:1, 8) and the Philistines encroached on Israel's territory. Since the Syrians and Israelites were allies by 735 B.C. (see 7:1), the hostilities described probably occurred earlier, while Israel was still pro-Assyrian. In this case one might understand the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/yxr yrx</FONT>, "adversaries of Rezin," as meaning, "adversaries sent from Rezin." However, another option, the one chosen in the translation above, is to emend the phrase to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wyrx</FONT>, "his [i.e., their] adversaries." This creates tighter parallelism with the next line (note "his [i.e., their] enemies"). The phrase in the Hebrew text may be explained as virtually dittographic.<br>
 <a name="fn411" href="isa.htm#fnB411"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:11)  The prefixed verbal form is understood as a preterite, used, as is often the case in poetry, without <i>vav</i> consecutive.

 <a name="fn413" href="isa.htm#fnB413"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn </b> (9:12) <i>Heb </i>"in all this his anger is not turned, and still his hand is outstretched." One could translate in the past tense here (and in 9:17b and 21b), but the appearance of the refrain in 10:4b, where it follows a woe oracle prophesying a future judgment, suggests it is a dramatic portrait of the judge which did not change throughout this period of past judgment and will remain unchanged in the future. The English present tense is chosen to best reflect this dramatic mood. (See also 5:25b, where the refrain appears following a dramatic description of coming judgment.)<br>
 <a name="fn414" href="isa.htm#fnB414"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:13)  This verse describes the people's response to the judgment described in vv. 11-12. The perfects are understood as indicating simple past.<br>

(Similar titles appear in Deut 10:17 and Neh 9:32 ["the great, mighty, and awesome God"] and in Jer 32:18 ["the great and mighty God"]. Both titles refer to God.) Though Hos 3:5 pictures Israel someday seeking "David their king," and provides some support for a messianic interpretation of Isa 10:21, the Davidic king is not mentioned in the immediate context of Isa 10:21 (see Isa 11, however). The preceding verse mentions Israel relying on the LORD, so it is likely that the title refers to God here.<br>

In its original context the name was meant to encourage Ahaz (see the note at 7:3), but here it has taken on new dimensions. In light of Ahaz's failure and the judgment it brings down on the land, the name Shear-jashub now foreshadows the destiny of the nation. According to vv. 21-22, there is good news and bad news. The good news is that a remnant of God's people will return; the bad news is that only a remnant will be preserved and come back. Like the name Immanuel, this name foreshadows both judgment (see the notes at 7:25 and 8:8) and ultimate restoration (see the note at 8:10).<br>

 <a name="fn485" href="isa.htm#fnB485"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn </b> (10:24) <i>Heb </i>"therefore." The message that follows is one of encouragement, for it focuses on the eventual destruction of the Assyrians. Consequently "therefore" relates back to vv. 5-21, not to vv. 22-23, which must be viewed as a brief parenthesis in an otherwise positive speech. <br>
 <a name="fn486" href="isa.htm#fnB486"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn </b> (10:24) <i>Heb </i>"in the way [or, "manner"] of Egypt."<br>
 <a name="fn487" href="isa.htm#fnB487"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tc</b> (10:25)  The Hebrew text has simply "fury," but the pronominal element can be assumed on the basis of what immediately follows (see "my anger" in the clause). It is possible that the suffixed <i>yod</i> has been accidentally dropped by virtual haplography. Note that a <i>vav</i> is prefixed to the form that immediately follows; <i>yod</i> and <i>vav</i> are very similar in later script phases.<br>

 <a name="fn490" href="isa.htm#fnB490"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tc</b> (10:26)  The Hebrew text reads literally, "and his staff [will be] against the sea, and he will lift it in the way [or, "manner"] of Egypt." If the text is retained, "the sea" symbolizes Assyria's hostility, the metaphor being introduced because of the reference to Egypt. The translation above assumes an emendation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yh lu</FONT>, "against the sea," to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;hylu</FONT>, "against them." The proposed shift from the third singular pronoun (note "beat him" earlier in the verse) to the plural is not problematic, for the singular is collective. Note that a third plural pronoun is used at the end of v. 25 ("their destruction"). The final phrase, "in the way/manner of Egypt," probably refers to the way in which God used the staff of Moses to bring judgment down on Egypt. <br>
 <a name="fn491" href="isa.htm#fnB491"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn </b> (10:27) Or, "in that day."<br>

 <a name="fn493" href="isa.htm#fnB493"><sup>58</sup></a><b>tc</b> (10:27)  The meaning of this line is uncertain. The Hebrew text reads literally, "and the yoke will be destroyed (or perhaps, "pulled down") because of fatness." Perhaps this is a bizarre picture of an ox growing so fat that it breaks the yoke around its neck or can no longer fit into its yoke. Fatness would symbolize the LORD's restored blessings; the removal of the yoke would symbolize the cessation of Assyrian oppression. Because of the difficulty of the metaphor, many prefer to emend the text at this point. Some emend <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lbjw</FONT>, "and it will be destroyed" (a perfect with <i>vav</i>), to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lbjy</FONT>, "[it] will be destroyed (an imperfect), and take the verb with what precedes, "and their yoke will be destroyed from your neck." Proponents of this view then emend <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu</FONT>, "yoke," to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlu</FONT>, "he came up," and understand this verb as introducing the following description of the Assyrian invasion (vv. 28-32). <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/mv ynpm</FONT>, "because of fatness,' is then emended to read, "from before Rimmon," "from before Samaria," or "from before Jeshimon." <br>
 <a name="fn494" href="isa.htm#fnB494"><sup>59</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:28)  Verses 28-31 display a staccato style; the statements are short and disconnected (no conjunctions appear in the Hebrew text). The translation to follow strives for a choppy style that reflects the mood of the speech. <br>

 <b>sn</b> (10:28)  Verses 28-32 describe an invasion of Judah from the north. There is no scholarly consensus on when this particular invasion took place, if at all. Hayes and Irvine (<i>Isaiah</i>, 209-10) suggest the text describes the Israelite-Syrian invasion of Judah (ca. 735 B.C.), but this proposal disregards the preceding context, which prophesies the destruction of Assyria. Some suggest that this invasion occurred in conjunction with Sargon's western campaign of 713-711 B.C., but there is no historical evidence of such an invasion at that time. Many others identify the invasion as Sennacherib's in 701 B.C., but historical records indicate Sennacherib approached Jerusalem from the southwest. Oswalt (<i>Isaiah</i>, 274-75) prefers to see the description as rhetorical and as not corresponding to any particular historical event, but Hayes and Irvine argue that the precise geographical details militate against such a proposal. Perhaps it is best to label the account as rhetorical-prophetic. The prophecy of the invasion was not necessarily intended to be a literal itinerary of the Assyrians' movements; rather its primary purpose was to create a foreboding mood. Geographical references contribute to this purpose, but they merely reflect how one would expect an Assyrian invasion to proceed, not necessarily how the actual invasion would progress. Despite its rhetorical nature, the prophecy does point to the invasion of 701 B.C., as the announcement of the invaders' downfall in vv. 33-34 makes clear; it was essentially fulfilled at that time. For further discussion of the problem, see R. Clements, <i>Isaiah</i>, 117-19. On the geographical details of the account, see Y. Aharoni, <i>The Land of the Bible</i>, 393.<br>

 <a name="fn497" href="isa.htm#fnB497"><sup>62</sup></a><b>tc</b> (10:30)  The Hebrew text reads, "Poor [is] Anathoth." The parallelism is tighter if <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hY&#180;n]u&amp;</FONT>, "poor," is emended to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">h*yn]u&amp;</FONT>, "answer her."

On the phrase "Daughter Zion," see the note at 1:8.<br>
 <a name="fn499" href="isa.htm#fnB499"><sup>64</sup></a><b>tc</b> (10:33)  The Hebrew text reads, "with terrifying power," or "with a crash." <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hxrum</FONT>, "terrifying power," or "crash," occurs only here.

 <b>sn</b> (10:33)  As in vv. 12 (see the note there) and 18, the Assyrians are compared to a tree/forest in vv. 33-34. <br>
 <a name="fn500" href="isa.htm#fnB500"><sup>65</sup></a><b>tn </b> (10:33) <i>Heb </i>"the exalted of the height." This could refer to the highest branches or the tallest trees. <br>
 <a name="fn501" href="isa.htm#fnB501"><sup>66</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:34)  The Hebrew text has, "and Lebanon, by/as [?] a mighty one, will fall." The translation above takes the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">b</FONT> prefixed to "mighty one" as indicating identity, "Lebanon, as a mighty one, will fall." In this case "mighty one" describes Lebanon. (In Ezek 17:23 and Zech 11:2 the adjective is used of Lebanon's cedars.) Another option is to take the preposition as indicating agency and interpret "mighty one" as a divine title (see Isa 33:21). One could then translate, "and Lebanon will fall by [the agency of] the Mighty One."<br>
 <a name="fn502" href="isa.htm#fnB502"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (11:1)  The text mentions David's father Jesse, instead of the great king himself. Perhaps this is done for rhetorical reasons to suggest that a new David, not just another disappointing Davidic descendant, will arise. Other prophets call the coming ideal Davidic king "David" or picture him as the second coming of David, as it were. See Jer 30:9; Ezek 34:23-24; 37:24-25; Hos 3:5; and Mic 5:2 (as well as the note there). <br>
 <a name="fn503" href="isa.htm#fnB503"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tc</b> (11:1)  The Hebrew text has <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrpy</FONT>, "will bear fruit" (from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrp</FONT>), but the ancient versions, as well as the parallelism suggest that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jrpy</FONT>, "will sprout" (from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jrp</FONT>) is the better reading here. See Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i>, 276, note 2.<br>

 <a name="fn506" href="isa.htm#fnB506"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn </b> (11:2) <i>Heb </i>"a spirit of counsel [or, "strategy"] and strength." The construction is a hendiadys; the point is that he will have the strength/ability to execute the plans/strategies he devises. This ability will enable him to suppress oppressors and implement just policies (v. 4). <br>
 <a name="fn507" href="isa.htm#fnB507"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn </b> (11:2) <i>Heb </i>"a spirit of knowledge and fear of the LORD." "Knowledge" is used here in its covenantal sense and refers to a recognition of God's authority and a willingness to submit to it. See Jer 22:16. "Fear" here refers to a healthy respect for God's authority which produces obedience. Taken together the two terms emphasize the single quality of loyalty to the LORD. This loyalty guarantees that he will make just legal decisions and implement just policies (vv. 4-5).<br>
 <a name="fn508" href="isa.htm#fnB508"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:3)  The Hebrew text reads literally, "and his smelling is in the fear of the LORD." In Amos 5:21 the Hiphil of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jwr</FONT>, "smell," carries the nuance of "smell with delight, get pleasure from." There the LORD declares that he does not "smell with delight" (i.e., get pleasure from) Israel's religious assemblies, which probably stand by metonymy for the incense offered during these festivals. In Isa 11:3 there is no sacrificial context to suggest such a use, but it is possible that "the fear of the LORD" is likened to incense. This coming king will get the same kind of delight from obeying (fearing) the LORD, as a deity does in the incense offered by worshipers. Some regard such an explanation as strained in this context, and prefer to omit this line from the text as a virtual dittograph of the preceding statement. <br>
 <a name="fn509" href="isa.htm#fnB509"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn </b> (11:3) <i>Heb </i>"by what appears to his eyes."<br>

It is uncertain if the passage is picturing universal dominion or focusing on the king's rule over his covenant people. The reference to God's "holy mountain" in v. 9 and the description of renewed Israelite conquests in v. 14 suggest the latter, though v. 10 seems to refer to a universal kingdom (see 2:2-4).<br>
 <a name="fn514" href="isa.htm#fnB514"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tc</b> (11:4)  The Hebrew text reads literally, "and he will strike the earth with the scepter of his mouth." In this context <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jra</FONT>, "earth," as an object of judgment seems too broad in scope.

Even though the heading and subsequent context (see v. 17) indicate Babylon's judgment is in view, the chapter has a cosmic flavor that suggests that the coming judgment is universal in scope. Perhaps Babylon's downfall occurs in conjunction with a wider judgment, or the cosmic style is poetic hyperbole used to emphasize the magnitude and importance of the coming event.<br>

The comparative preposition (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">k</FONT>) has here the rhetorical nuance, "in every way like." The point is that the destruction unleashed will have all the earmarks of divine judgment. One could paraphrase, "it comes as only destructive divine judgment can." On this use of the preposition in general, see GKC &#167;118.<i>x</i>.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (13:6)  The divine name used here is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yD~v^</FONT>, "Shaddai." Shaddai/El Shaddai is the sovereign king/judge of the world who grants life/blesses and kills/judges. In Genesis he blesses the patriarchs with fertility and promises numerous descendants. Outside Genesis he both blesses/protects and takes away life/happiness. The patriarchs knew God primarily as El Shaddai (Exod 6:3). While the origin and meaning of this name is uncertain (see discussion below) its significance is clear. The name is used in contexts where God appears as the source of fertility and life. In Gen 17:1-8 he appears to Abram, introduces himself as El Shaddai, and announces his intention to make the patriarch fruitful. In the role of El Shaddai God repeats these words (now elevated to the status of a decree) to Jacob (35:11). Earlier Isaac had pronounced a blessing upon Jacob in which he asked El Shaddai to make Jacob fruitful (28:3). Jacob later prays that his sons will be treated with mercy when they return to Egypt with Benjamin (43:14). The fertility theme is not as apparent here, though one must remember that Jacob viewed Benjamin as the sole remaining son of the favored and once-barren Rachel (cf. 29:31; 30:22-24; 35:16-18). It is quite natural that he would appeal to El Shaddai to preserve Benjamin's life, for it was El Shaddai's miraculous power which made it possible for Rachel to give him sons in the first place. In 48:3 Jacob, prior to blessing Joseph's sons, tells him how El Shaddai appeared to him at Bethel (cf. chapter 28) and promised to make him fruitful. When blessing Joseph on his deathbed Jacob refers to Shaddai (we should probably read "El Shaddai," along with a few Hebrew MSS, the Samaritan Pentateuch, LXX, and Syriac) as the one who provides abundant blessings, including "blessings of the breast and womb" (49:25). (The direct association of the name with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;y]d~v*</FONT>, "breasts," suggests the name might mean "the one of the breast" [i.e., the one who gives fertility], but the juxtaposition is probably better explained as wordplay. Note the wordplay involving the name and the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dd~v*</FONT>, "destroy," here in Isa 13:6 and in Joel 1:15.) Outside Genesis the name Shaddai (minus El, "God") is normally used when God is viewed as the sovereign king who blesses/protects or curses/brings judgment. The name appears in the introduction to two of Balaam's oracles (Num 24:4, 16) of blessing upon Israel. Naomi employs the name when accusing the LORD of treating her bitterly by taking the lives of her husband and sons (Ru 1:20-21). In Ps 68:14; Isa 13:6; and Joel 1:15 Shaddai judges his enemies through warfare, while Ps 91:1 depicts him as the protector of his people. (In Ezek 1:24 and 10:5 the sound of the cherubs' wings is compared to Shaddai's powerful voice. The reference may be to the mighty divine warrior's battle cry which accompanies his angry judgment.) Last but not least, the name occurs 31 times in the Book of Job. Job and his "friends" assume that Shaddai is the sovereign king of the world (11:7; 37:23a) who is the source of life (33:4b) and is responsible for maintaining justice (8:3; 34:10-12; 37:23b). He provides abundant blessings, including children (22:17-18; 29:4-6), but can also discipline, punish, and destroy (5:17; 6:4; 21:20; 23:16). It is not surprising to see the name so often in this book, where the theme of God's justice is primary and even called into question (24:1; 27:2).The most likely proposal is that the name means "God, the one of the mountain" (an Akkadian cognate means "mountain," to which Heb. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dv^</FONT> (<i>sad</i>), "breast," is probably related). For a discussion of proposed derivations see T. N. D. Mettinger, <i>In Search of God</i> , 70-71. The name may originally depict God as the sovereign judge who, in Canaanite style, rules from a sacred mountain. Isa 14:13 and Ezek 28:14, 16 associate such a mountain with God, while Ps 48:2 refers to Zion as "Zaphon," the Canaanite Olympus from which the high god El ruled. (In Isa 14 the Canaanite god El may be in view. Note that Isaiah pictures pagan kings as taunting the king of Babylon, suggesting that pagan mythology may provide the background for the language and imagery.)<br>

 <a name="fn616" href="isa.htm#fnB616"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (13:22)  When was the prophecy of Babylon's fall fulfilled? Some (see, for example, S. Erlandsson, <i>The Burden of Babylon</i>) argue that the prophecy was fulfilled in 689 B.C. when the Assyrians under Sennacherib sacked and desecrated the city (this event is alluded to in 23:13). This may have been an initial phase in the fulfillment of the prophecy, but the reference to the involvement of the Medes (v. 17) and the suggestion that Babylon's demise will bring about the restoration of Israel (14:1-2) indicate that the fall of Babylon to the Medes and Persians in 538 B.C. is the primary focus of the prophecy. (After all, the LORD did reveal to Isaiah that the Chaldeans [not the Assyrians] would someday conquer Jerusalem and take the people into exile [see 39:5-7].) However, the vivid picture of destruction in vv. 15-22 raises a problem. The Medes and Persians did not destroy the city; in fact Cyrus's takeover of Babylon, though preceded by a military campaign, was relatively peaceful and even welcomed by some Babylonian religious officials. How then does one explain the prophecy's description of the city's violent fall? As noted above, the events of 689 B.C. and 538 B.C. may have been merged in the prophecy. However, it is more likely that the language is stylized and exaggerated for rhetorical effect. See Isa 34:11-15; Jer 50:39-40 (describing Babylon's fall in 538 B.C.); 51:36-37 (describing Babylon's fall in 538 B.C.); Zeph. 2:13-15; the extra-biblical Sefire treaty curses; and Ashurbanipal's description of the destruction of Elam in his royal annals. In other words, the events of 538 B.C. essentially, though not necessarily literally, fulfill the prophecy.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (14:12)  What is the background for the imagery in vv. 12-15? This whole section (vv. 4b-21) is directed to the king of Babylon, who is clearly depicted as a human ruler. Other kings of the earth address him in vv. 9ff., he is called "the man" in v. 16, and, according to vv. 19-20, he possesses a physical body. Nevertheless the language of vv. 12-15 has led some to see a dual referent in the taunt song. These verses, which appear to be spoken by other pagan kings to a pagan king (cf. vv. 9-11), contain several titles and motifs that resemble those of Canaanite mythology, including references to Helel son of Shachar, the stars of El, the mountain of assembly, the recesses of Zaphon, and the divine title Most High. Apparently these verses allude to a mythological story about a minor god (Helel son of Shachar) who tried to take over Zaphon, the mountain of the gods. His attempted coup failed and he was hurled down to the underworld. The king of Babylon is taunted for having similar unrealized delusions of grandeur. Some Christians have seen an allusion to the fall of Satan here, but this seems contextually unwarranted (see J. Martin, <i>BKCOT</i>, 1061). <br>

The "raisin cakes" could have cultic significance (see Hos 3:1), but the next verse focuses on agricultural disaster, so here the raisin cakes are mentioned as an example of the fine foods that are no longer available (see 2 Sam 6:19; Song 2:5) because the vines have been destroyed by the invader (see v. 8). Some prefer to take <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yvyva</FONT>, "raisin cakes of," as "men of" (see <i>HALOT</i> 95; cf. NIV). The verb form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wght</FONT>, "you moan," is probably the result of dittography (note that the preceding word ends in <i>tav</i>) and should be emended to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wgh</FONT> (a perfect, third plural form), "they moan."<br>

The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yum</FONT>, "intestines," is used here of the seat of the emotions. English idiom requires the word "heart." The point of the comparison to a harp is not entirely clear. Perhaps his sighs of mourning resemble a harp in sound, or his constant sighing is like the repetitive strumming of a harp.<br>

For this reason some want to emend the text here, reading: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">du ydu hyru twbzu</FONT>, "her cities are permanently abandoned." However, Aroer near the Arnon was taken by Israel and later conquered by the Syrians. (See Josh 12:2; 13:9, 16; Judg 11:26; 2 Kgs 10:33). This oracle pertains to Israel as well as Syria (note v. 3), so it is possible that this is a reference to Israelite and/or Syrian losses in Transjordan.<br>

The substantival adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rz</FONT> functions here as an appositional genitive. It could refer to a cultic plant of some type, associated with a pagan rite.

To translate the lines in the order they appear in the Hebrew text is misleading to the English reader, who is likely unfamiliar with, or at least insensitive to, chiastic parallelism. Consequently, the translation above arranges the lines as follows: line 1 (Hebrew) = line 1 (in translation); line 2 (Hebrew) = line 4 (in translation); line 3 (Hebrew) = line 3 (in translation); line 4 (Hebrew) = line 2 (in translation).<br>

The shift from the first to third person is peculiar and abrupt, but certainly not unprecedented in Hebrew poetry. See GKC &#167;144.<i>p</i>.

 <a name="fn918" href="isa.htm#fnB918"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tc</b> (23:1)  The Hebrew text reads literally, "for it is destroyed, from a house, from entering." The translation assumes that the <i>mem</i> on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tyb</FONT> was originally an enclitic <i>mem</i> suffixed to the preceding verb. This assumption allows one to take <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tyb</FONT> as the subject of the preceding verb. It is used in a metaphorical sense for the port city of Tyre. The preposition prefixed to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">awb</FONT> indicates negative consequence, "so that no one can enter." See BDB 583 (7.b). <br>

The pronoun "you" is masculine plural, like the imperatives in v. 6, so it is likely addressed to the Egyptians and residents of the coast. "Boisterous one" is a feminine singular form, probably referring to the personified city of Tyre.<br>

The form is a Hiphil participle from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rfu</FONT>, a denominative verb derived from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrfu</FONT>, "crown, wreath." The participle may mean "one who wears a crown," or "one who distributes crowns." In either case, Tyre's prominence in the international political arena is in view.<br>

The translation assumes an emendation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jzm</FONT>, "waistband," to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">zjm</FONT>, "harbor, market place" (see Ps 107:30). The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rbu</FONT>, "cross over" is probably used here of traveling over the water (as in v. 6). The command is addressed to personified Tarshish, who here represents her merchants. 1QIs<sup><sub>a</sub></sup> has <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ydbu</FONT>, "work, cultivate," instead of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wrbu</FONT>, "cross over." In this case one might translate, "Cultivate your land, like they do the Nile region" (cf. NIV). The point would be that the people of Tarshish should turn to agriculture because they will no longer be able to get what they need through the market place in Tyre.<br>

In this context, where judgment comes upon both the pagan nations and God's covenant community, the phrase "permanent treaty" is intentionally ambiguous. For the nations this treaty is the Noahic mandate of Gen 9:1-7 with its specific stipulations and central regulation (Gen 9:7). By shedding blood, the warlike nations violated this treaty, which promotes population growth and prohibits murder. For Israel, which was also guilty of bloodshed (see Isa 1:15, 21; 4:4), this "permanent treaty" would refer more specifically to the Mosaic Law and its regulations prohibiting murder (Exod 20:13; Num 35:6-34), which are an extension of the Noahic mandate. <br>

 <a name="fn975" href="isa.htm#fnB975"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:10)  Traditionally, "the city of chaos." Isaiah uses the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wht</FONT> rather frequently of things (like idols) that are empty and worthless (see BDB 1062), so the word might characterize the city as rebellious or morally worthless. However, in this context, which focuses on the effects of divine judgment, it probably refers to the ruined or worthless condition in which the city is left (note the use of the word in Isa 34:11). For a discussion of the identity of this city, see R. Chisholm, "The `Everlasting Covenant' and the `City of Chaos': Intentional Ambiguity and Irony in Isaiah 24," <i>CTR</i> 6 (1993): 237-53. In the context of universal judgment depicted in Isa 24, this city represents all the nations and cities of the world which, like Babylon of old and the powers/cities mentioned in chapters 13-23, rebel against God's authority. Behind the stereotypical language one can detect various specific manifestations of this symbolic and paradigmatic city, including Babylon, Moab, and Jerusalem, all of which are alluded or referred to in chapters 24-27. <br>

In the first line ("I'm wasting away...") four consecutive words end with <i>hireq</i> <i>yod</i>; in the second line all forms are derived from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dgb</FONT>.

In this context, with "song" as object, it means to "quiet" (see <i>HALOT</i> 853-54). Some prefer to emend the form to the second person singular, so that it will agree with the second person verb earlier in the verse. BDB 776 understands the form as Qal, with "song" as subject, in which case one might translate, "the song of tyrants will be silent."

The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rxy</FONT> refers to what one devises in the mind; <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">iwms</FONT> probably functions here like an attributive adjective and carries the nuance "firm." So the phrase literally means, "a firm purpose," but as the object of the verb "keep, guard," it must stand by metonymy for the one(s) who possess a firm purpose. In this context the "righteous nation" (v. 2) is probably in view and the "firm purpose" refers to their unwavering faith in God's vindication (see 25:9). In this context <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;wlv</FONT>, "peace," which is repeated for emphasis, likely refers to national security, not emotional or psychological composure (see vv. 1-2).

Verses 10-11a seem to lament the presence of evil and v. 11b anticipates the arrival of judgment, so it is possible that vv. 7-15 are a prelude to the lament and announcement that conclude the chapter. <br>

 <a name="fn1070" href="isa.htm#fnB1070"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:16)  The meaning of this verse is unclear. It appears to read literally, "O LORD, in distress they visit you, they pour out [?] an incantation, your discipline to them." <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dqp</FONT> may here carry the sense of "seek with interest" (cf. Ezek 23:21 and BDB 823) or "seek in vain" (cf.

Because of the appearance of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rx</FONT>, "distress," in the preceding line, it is tempting to emend the form to a noun and derive it from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qwx</FONT>, "be in distress." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vjl</FONT> elsewhere refers to an incantation (Isa 3:3; Jer 8:17; Eccl 10:11) or amulet (Isa 3:20). Perhaps here it refers to ritualistic prayers or to magical incantations used to ward off evil. <br>

Israel's distress and suffering, likened here to the pains of childbirth, seemed to be for no purpose. A woman in labor endures pain with the hope that a child will be born; in Israel's case no such positive outcome was apparent. The nation was like a woman who strains to bring forth a child, but can't push the baby through to daylight. All her effort produces nothing. <br>
 <a name="fn1072" href="isa.htm#fnB1072"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn </b> (26:18) <i>Heb </i>"and the inhabitants of the world do not fall." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lpn</FONT> apparently means here, "be born," though the Qal form of the verb is not used with this nuance anywhere else in the OT. (The Hiphil appears to be used in the sense of "give birth" in v. 19, however.) The implication of verse 18b seems to be that Israel hoped its suffering would somehow end in deliverance and an increase in population. The phrase "inhabitants of the world" seems to refer to the human race in general, but the next verse, which focuses on Israel's dead, suggests the referent may be more limited. <br>

 <a name="fn1075" href="isa.htm#fnB1075"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:19)  The Hebrew text reads literally, "for the dew of lights [is] your dew." The pronominal suffix on "dew" is masculine singular, like the suffixes on "your dead" and "your corpses" in the first half of the verse. The statement, then, is addressed to collective Israel, the speaker in verse 18. The plural form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">trwa</FONT> is probably a plural of respect or magnitude, meaning "bright light" (i.e., morning's light). Dew is a symbol of fertility and life. Here Israel's "dew," as it were, will soak the dust of the ground and cause the corpses of the dead to spring up to new life, like plants sprouting up from well-watered soil. <br>

 <a name="fn1083" href="isa.htm#fnB1083"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (27:1)  The description of Leviathan should be compared with the following excerpts from Ugaritic mythological texts: (1) "Was not the dragon (Ugaritic <i>tnn</i>, cognate with Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ynt</FONT>, translated "sea monster" here) vanquished and captured? I did destroy the wriggling (Ugaritic <i>&#180;qltn</i>, cognate to Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/wtlqu</FONT>, translated "squirming" here) serpent, the tyrant with seven heads (cf. Ps 74:14)." (See <i>CTA</i> 3 iii 38-39 in Gibson, <i>CML</i>, 50.) (2) "for all that you smote Leviathan the slippery [Ugaritic <i>brh</i>, cognate to Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jrb</FONT>, translated "fast-moving" here] serpent, [and] made an end of the wriggling serpent, the tyrant with seven heads" (See <i>CTA</i> 5 i 1-3 in Gibson, <i>CML</i>, 68.) In the myths Leviathan is a sea creature that symbolizes the destructive water of the sea and in turn the forces of chaos that threaten the established order. Isaiah here applies imagery from Canaanite mythology to Yahweh's eschatological victory over his enemies. Elsewhere in the OT, the battle with the sea motif is applied to Yahweh's victories over the forces of chaos at creation and in history (cf. Pss 74:13-14; 77:16-20; 89:9-10; Isa 51:9-10). Yahweh's subjugation of the chaos waters is related to His kingship (cf. Pss 29:3, 10; 93:3-4). Apocalyptic literature employs the imagery as well. The beasts of Dan 7 emerge from the sea, while Rev 13 speaks of a seven-headed beast coming from the sea.<br>

The meaning of the text is unclear, but this may be a rhetorical question, suggesting that Israel has not experienced divine judgment to the same degree as her oppressors. In this case "the one striking down" refers to Israel's oppressors, while the pronoun "him" refers to Israel. The subject of the final verb ("does he strike down") would then be God, while the pronoun "him" would again refer to Israel.<br>
 <a name="fn1097" href="isa.htm#fnB1097"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (27:7)  The Hebrew text reads literally, "Or like the killing of his killed ones is he killed?" If one accepts the interpretation of the parallel line outlined in the previous note, then this line too would contain a rhetorical question suggesting that Israel has not experienced destruction to the same degree as its enemies. In this case "his killed ones" refers to the one who struck Israel down, and Israel would be the subject of the final verb ("is he killed").<br>
 <a name="fn1098" href="isa.htm#fnB1098"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (27:8)  The Hebrew text reads literally, "in [?], in sending her away, you oppose her." The meaning of this line is uncertain. The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hasasb</FONT> is taken as an infinitive from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">asas</FONT> with a prepositional prefix and a third feminine singular suffix. (The MT does not have a <i>mappiq</i> in the final <i>he</i>, however.) According to <i>HALOT</i> 738, the verb is a Palpel form from an otherwise unattested root cognate with an Arabic verb meaning, "to gather beasts with a call." Perhaps it means "to call, summon," here, but this is a very tentative proposal. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hjlvb</FONT>, "in sending her away," appears to be a Piel infinitive with a prepositional prefix and a third feminine singular suffix. Since the Piel of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jlv</FONT> can sometimes mean "divorce," and the following verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">byr</FONT>, "oppose," can be used in legal contexts, it is possible that divorce proceedings are alluded to here. This may explain why Israel is referred to as feminine in this verse, in contrast to the masculine forms used in vv. 6-7 and 9.<br>
 <a name="fn1099" href="isa.htm#fnB1099"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (27:8)  The Hebrew text has no object expressed, but one can understand a third feminine singular pronominal object and place a <i>mappiq</i> in the final <i>he</i> of the form to indicate the suffix.<br>

The meaning of the statement is not entirely clear, though "removing his sin" certainly parallels "Jacob's sin will be removed" in the preceding line. If original, "all the fruit" may refer to the result of the decision to remove sin, but the phrase may be a corruption of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rpkl</FONT>, "to atone for," which in turn might be a gloss on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rsh</FONT>, "removing." <br>

 <a name="fn1104" href="isa.htm#fnB1104"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (27:9)  As interpreted and translated above, this verse says that Israel must totally repudiate its pagan religious practices in order to experience God's forgiveness and restoration. Another option is to understand "in this way" and "this" in v. 9a as referring back to the judgment described in v. 8. In this case <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rpk</FONT>, "atone for," is used in a sarcastic sense; Jacob's sin is "atoned for" and removed through severe judgment. Following this line of interpretation, one might paraphrase the verse as follows: "So in this way (through judgment) Jacob's sin will be "atoned for," and this is they way his sin will be removed, when he (i.e., God) makes all the altar stones like crushed limestone...." This interpretation is more consistent with the tone of judgment in vv. 8 and 10-11. <br>

The translation assumes that the the LORD is the subject of the verbs "teaching" and "explaining," and that the prophet is asking the questions. See v. 12. According to some vv. 9-10 record the people's sarcastic response to the LORD's message through Isaiah. <br>
 <a name="fn1139" href="isa.htm#fnB1139"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn </b> (28:9) <i>Heb </i>"from the breasts." The words "their mother's" are supplied in the translation for clarification. The translation assumes that this is the prophet's answer to the questions asked in the first half of the verse. The LORD is trying to instruct people who are "infants" morally and ethically.<br>
 <a name="fn1140" href="isa.htm#fnB1140"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:10)  The meaning of this verse has been debated. The text has literally, "indeed [or, "for"] tsahv latsahv, tsahv latsahv, kahv lakhav, kahv lakhav; a little there, a little there." The translation assumes that the repetitive syllables are gibberish that resembles baby-talk (cf v. 9b) and mimics what the people will hear when foreign invaders conquer the land (v. 11). In this case <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ryuz</FONT>, "a little," refers to the short syllabic structure of the babbling. Some take <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wx^</FONT> ("tsahv") as a derivative of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwx</FONT>, "command," and translate the first part of the statement as "command after command, command after command." Proponents of this position also take <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wq^</FONT> ("kahv") as a noun meaning "measuring line" (see v. 17), understood here in the abstract sense of "standard" or "rule." <br>
 <a name="fn1141" href="isa.htm#fnB1141"><sup>23</sup></a><b>sn</b> (28:11)  This verse alludes to the coming Assyrian invasion, when the people will hear a foreign language that sounds like gibberish to them. The LORD is the subject of the verb "will speak," as v. 12 makes clear. He once spoke in meaningful terms, but in the coming judgment he will speak to them, as it were, through the mouth of foreign oppressors. The apparent gibberish they hear will be an outward reminder that God has decreed their defeat. <br>

In this case the "LORD's word" is not the foreigner's strange sounding words (as in v. 10), but the LORD's repeated appeals to them (like the one quoted in v. 12). As time goes on, the LORD's appeals through the prophets will have no impact on the people; they will regard prophetic preaching as gibberish. <br>
 <a name="fn1145" href="isa.htm#fnB1145"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn </b> (28:13) <i>Heb </i>"as a result they will go and stumble backward." Perhaps an infant falling as it attempts to learn to walk is the background image here (cf. v. 9b). The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/uml</FONT> could be taken as indicating purpose ("in order that"), rather than simple result. In this case the people's insensitivity to the message is caused by the LORD as a means of expediting their downfall.<br>
 <a name="fn1146" href="isa.htm#fnB1146"><sup>28</sup></a><b>sn</b> (28:13)  When divine warnings and appeals become gibberish to the spiritually insensitive, they have no guidance and are doomed to destruction.<br>

In v. 18 the related term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twzj</FONT>, "vision," is used. The parallelism in both verses (note "treaty") seems to demand a meaning "agreement" for both nouns. Perhaps <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hzj</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twzj</FONT> are used in a metonymic sense in vv. 15 and 18. Another option is to propose a homonymic root.

 <a name="fn1151" href="isa.htm#fnB1151"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tc</b> (28:16)  The Hebrew text has a third person verb form, which does not agree with the first person suffix that precedes.

The stone appears to represent someone or something that gives Zion stability. Perhaps the ideal Davidic ruler is in view (see 32:1). Another option is that the image of beginning a building project by laying a precious cornerstone suggests that God is about to transform Zion through judgment and begin a new covenant community that will experience his protection (see 4:3-6; 31:5; 33:20-24; 35:10). <br>

The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrwc</FONT> is sometimes translated "[in] its place," but the word is unattested elsewhere. It is probably due to dittography of the immediately following <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hruc</FONT>, "barley." The meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/msn</FONT> is also uncertain.

Evidence of this can be seen in the way farmers utilize divinely imparted wisdom to grow and harvest crops. God's dealings with his people will exhibit this same kind of wisdom and order. Judgment will be accomplished according to a divinely ordered timetable and, while severe enough, will not be excessive. Judgment must come, just as planting inevitably follows plowing. God will, as it were, thresh his people, but he will not crush them to the point where they will be of no use to him.<br>

 <a name="fn1177" href="isa.htm#fnB1177"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn </b> (29:1) <i>Heb </i>"the town where David camped."

 <a name="fn1178" href="isa.htm#fnB1178"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn </b> (29:1) <i>Heb </i>"Add year to year, let your festivals occur in cycles."

The translation assumes an emendation to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">whmth</FONT>, a Hitpael imperative from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmt</FONT>, "be amazed." In this case, the text, like Hab 1:5, combines the Hitpael and Qal imperatival forms of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmt</FONT>. A literal translation might be, "Shock yourselves and be shocked!"

In Isa 30:27 the point is that he reveals that aspect of his character which his name suggests--he comes as Yahweh ("he is present"), the ever present helper of his people who annihilates their enemies and delivers them. The name "Yahweh" originated in a context where God assured a fearful Moses that he would be with him as he confronted Pharaoh and delivered Israel from slavery in Egypt. See Exod 3. <br>

Some understand the term as referring to a cloud (elevated above the earth's surface), in which case one might translate, "and in heavy clouds." Others relate the noun to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">acm</FONT>, "burden," and interpret it as a reference to judgment. In this case one might translate, "and with severe judgment."

In Isa 34:16 and Ps 33:6 the LORD's "breath" is associated with his command.<br>

The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">js^P#</FONT>, "Passover," is derived from the verb. The use of the verb in Isa 31:5 is probably an intentional echo of the Exodus event.

 <a name="fn1357" href="isa.htm#fnB1357"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:11)  The imperatival forms in v. 11 are problematic. The first (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wdrj</FONT>, "tremble") is masculine plural in form, though spoken to a feminine plural addressee (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twnnav</FONT>, "complacent ones"). The four imperatival forms that follow (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hzgr</FONT>, "shake with fear;" <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hfvp</FONT>, "strip off your clothes;" <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hru</FONT>, "expose yourselves;" and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrwgj</FONT>, "put on") all appear to be lengthened (so-called "emphatic") masculine singular forms, even though they too appear to be spoken to a feminine plural addressee. GKC &#167;48.<i>i</i> suggests emending <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wdrj</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hdrj</FONT> and understanding all five imperatives as feminine plural "aramaized" forms. <br>
 <a name="fn1358" href="isa.htm#fnB1358"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tc</b> (32:12)  The Hebrew text has "over mourning breasts." The reference to "breasts" would make sense in light of v. 11, which refers to the practice of women baring their breasts as a sign of sorrow (see Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i>, 585). However, one expects the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu</FONT> to introduce the source or reason for mourning (see vv. 12b-13a) and the participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ydps</FONT>, "mourning," seems odd modifying "breasts." The translation above assumes a twofold emendation: (1) <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;y]d~v*</FONT>, "breasts," is emended to [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;</FONT>]<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yd~c*</FONT>, "field" (a term that also appears in Isa 56:9). The final <i>mem</i> would be enclitic in this case, not a plural indicator. (The Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hdc</FONT>, "field," forms its plural with an <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">to</FONT>- ending.) (2) The plural participle, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ydps</FONT> is emended to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hd&#180;p)s=</FONT>, a lengthened imperatival form, meaning "mourn."<br>
 <a name="fn1359" href="isa.htm#fnB1359"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:13)  "Mourn" is supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons. In the Hebrew text vv. 12-13 are one long sentence.<br>

The words "this desolation will continue" are supplied in the translation for clarification and stylistic purposes. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hru</FONT>, used here in the Niphal, normally means "lay bare, expose." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jwr</FONT>, "spirit," is often understood here as a reference to the divine spirit (cf. 44:3), but it appears here without an article, pronominal suffix, or a genitive (such as "of the LORD").

 <a name="fn1372" href="isa.htm#fnB1372"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:19)  The Hebrew text reads literally, "and [?] when the forest descends." The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">drbw</FONT> is often understood as an otherwise unattested denominative verb meaning "to hail" (<i>HALOT</i> 154). In this case one might translate, "and it hails when the forest is destroyed." Perhaps the text alludes to a powerful wind and hail storm that knocks down limbs and trees. Some prefer to emend the form to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dryw</FONT>, "and it descends," which provides better, though not perfect, symmetry with the parallel line. Perhaps <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">drbw</FONT> should be dismissed as dittographic. In this case the statement ("when the forest descends") lacks a finite verb and seems incomplete, but perhaps it is subordinate to v. 20.<br>

The normal meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dsj</FONT>, "faithfulness, loyalty, devotion," fits very well in the argument.

 <a name="fn1828" href="isa.htm#fnB1828"><sup>27</sup></a><b>sn</b> (43:24)  In vv. 22-24 the LORD appears to be condemning his people for failure to bring the proper sacrifices. However, this is problematic. If this refers to the nation's behavior while in exile, such cultic service was impossible and could hardly be expected by the LORD. If this refers to the nation's conduct before the exile, it contradicts other passages that depict Israel as bringing excessive sacrifices (see, e.g., Isa 1:11-14; Jer 6:20; Amos 4:4-5, 5:21-23). Rather than being a condemnation of Israel's failure to bring sacrifices, these verses are better taken as a highly rhetorical comment on the worthlessness of Israel's religious ritual. They may have brought sacrifices, but not to the LORD, for he did not accept them or even want them. See C. R. North, <i>The Second Isaiah</i>, 127, and R. Whybray, <i>Isaiah 40-66</i>, 91.<br>

 <a name="fn2064" href="isa.htm#fnB2064"><sup>5</sup></a><b>sn</b> (49:2)  The figurative language emphasizes the servant's importance as the LORD's effective instrument. The servant's mouth, which stands metonymically for his words, is compared to a sharp sword because he will be an effective spokesman on God's behalf (see 50:4). The LORD holds his hand on the servant, ready to draw and use him at the appropriate time. The servant is like a sharpened arrow reserved in a quiver for just the right moment.<br>
 <a name="fn2065" href="isa.htm#fnB2065"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (49:3)  This verse identifies the servant as <i>Israel</i>.

This servant is an ideal "Israel" who, like Moses of old, mediates a covenant for the nation (see v. 8), leads them out of bondage (v. 9a), and carries out God's original plan for Israel by positively impacting the pagan nations (see v. 6b). By living according to God's law, Israel was to be a model of God's standards of justice to the surrounding nations (Deut 4:6-8). The sinful nation failed, but the servant, the ideal "Israel," will succeed by establishing justice throughout the earth. <br>

This sea creature symbolizes the forces of chaos that seek to destroy the created order. In the Bible "the Proud One" opposes God's creative work, but is defeated (see Job 26:12; Ps 89:10 ET). Here the title refers to Pharaoh's Egyptian army that opposed Israel at the Red Sea (see v. 10, and note also Isa 30:7 and Ps 87:4, where the title is used of Egypt).<br>

The exiles are addressed in the immediately preceding verses (note the critical tone of vv. 12-13 and the reference to the exiles in v. 14). However, it seems unlikely that they are addressed in v. 16, for the addressee appears to be commissioned to tell Zion, who here represents the restored exiles, "you are my people." The addressee is distinct from the exiles. The language of v. 16a is reminiscent of 49:2 and 50:4, where the LORD's special servant says he is God's spokesman and effective instrument. Perhaps the LORD, having spoken to the exiles in vv. 1-15, now responds to this servant, who spoke just prior to this in 50:4-11.<br>

 <a name="fn2187" href="isa.htm#fnB2187"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:16)  The infinitives in v. 16b are most naturally understood as indicating the purpose of the divine actions described in v. 16a. The relationship of the third infinitive to the commission is clear enough--the LORD has made the addressee (his special servant?) his spokesman so that the latter might speak encouraging words to those in Zion. But how do the first two infinitives relate? The text seems to indicate that the LORD has commissioned the addressee so that the latter might create the universe! Perhaps creation imagery is employed metaphorically here to refer to the transformation that Jerusalem will experience (see 65:17-18). <br>

Though the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hz&#180;n&#180;</FONT> does occur in the Hiphil with the meaning "sprinkle," the usual interpretation is problematic. In all other instances where the object or person sprinkled is indicated, the verb is combined with a preposition. This is not the case in Isaiah 52:15, unless one takes the following <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wyl*u*</FONT>, "on him," with the preceding line. But then one would have to emend the verb to a plural, make the nations the subject of the verb "sprinkle," and take the servant as the object. Consequently some interpreters doubt the cultic idea of "sprinkling" is present here. Some emend the text; others propose a homonymic root meaning "spring, leap," which in the Hiphil could mean "cause to leap, startle" and would fit the parallelism of the verse nicely. <br>

 <a name="fn2224" href="isa.htm#fnB2224"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (53:1)  The first half of v. 1 is traditionally translated, "Who has believed our report?" or "Who has believed our message?" as if the group speaking is lamenting that no one will believe what they have to say. But that doesn't seem to be the point in this context. Here the group speaking does not cast itself in the role of a preacher or evangelist. No, they are repentant sinners, who finally see the light. The phrase "our report" can mean (1) the report which we deliver, or (2) the report which was delivered to us. The latter fits better here, where the report is most naturally taken as the announcement that has just been made in 52:13-15.<br>

The "arm of the LORD" is a metaphor of military power; it pictures the LORD as a warrior who bares his arm, takes up his weapon, and crushes his enemies (cf. 51:9-10; 63:5-6).

 <a name="fn2240" href="isa.htm#fnB2240"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (53:6)  Elsewhere the Hiphil of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ugp</FONT> means "to intercede verbally" (Jer 15:11; 36:25) or "to intervene militarily" (Isa 59:16), but neither nuance fits here. Apparently here the Hiphil is the causative of the normal Qal meaning, "encounter, meet, touch." The Qal sometimes refers to a hostile encounter or attack; when used in this way the object is normally introduced by the preposition -<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B=</FONT> (see Josh 2:16; Judg 8:21; 15:12, etc.). Here the causative Hiphil has a double object--the LORD makes "sin" attack "him" (note that the object attacked is introduced by the preposition -<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B=</FONT>. In their sin the group was like sheep who had wandered from God's path. They were vulnerable to attack; the guilt of their sin was ready to attack and destroy them. But then the servant stepped in and took the full force of the attack. <br>

 <a name="fn2242" href="isa.htm#fnB2242"><sup>21</sup></a><b>sn</b> (53:7)  This verse emphasizes the servant's silent submission. The comparison to a sheep does not necessarily suggest a sacrificial metaphor. Sheep were slaughtered for food as well as for sacrificial rituals, and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jbf</FONT> need not refer to sacrificial slaughter (see Gen 43:16; Prov 7:22; 9:2; Jer 50:27; note also the use of the related verb in Exod 21:37; Deut 28:31; 1 Sam 25:11). <br>
 <a name="fn2243" href="isa.htm#fnB2243"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (53:8)  The precise meaning of this line is uncertain. The translation above assumes that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m</FONT> here has an instrumental sense, "by, through," and understands <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">fpvmw rxu</FONT>, "coercion and legal decision," as a hendiadys meaning "coercive legal decision." Other interpretive options include: (1) "without [for this sense of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m</FONT>, see BDB 578] hindrance and proper judicial process," i.e., "unfairly and with no one to defend him," (2) "from [in the sense of "after," see BDB 581] arrest and judgment."<br>
 <a name="fn2244" href="isa.htm#fnB2244"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (53:8)  The text reads literally, "and his generation, who considers?" Some understand "his generation" as a reference to descendants. In this case the question would suggest that he will have none. However, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta</FONT> may be taken here as specifying a new subject (see BDB 85). If "his generation" refers to the servant's contemporary generation, one mya then translate, "As for his contemporary generation, who took note?" The point would be that few were concerned about the harsh treatment he received.<br>
 <a name="fn2245" href="isa.htm#fnB2245"><sup>24</sup></a><b>sn </b> (53:8) The "land of the living" is an idiom for the sphere where people live, in contrast to the underworld realm of the dead. See, for example, Ezek 32:23-27. <br>
 <a name="fn2246" href="isa.htm#fnB2246"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (53:8)  The Hebrew text reads, "my people." This is problematic in a context where the first person plural predominates, and where God does not appear to speak again until v. 11b. Therefore, it is preferable to read with 1QIs<sup><sub>a</sub></sup> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wmu</FONT>, "his people." In this case, the group speaking in these verses is identified as the servant's people (compare <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wnuvp</FONT>, "our rebellious deeds," in v. 5 with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wmu uvp</FONT>, "the rebellion of his people," in v. 8). <br>
 <a name="fn2247" href="isa.htm#fnB2247"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn </b> (53:9) <i>Heb </i>"one assigned his grave with criminals." The subject of the singular is impersonal; English typically uses "they" in such constructions.<br>
 <a name="fn2248" href="isa.htm#fnB2248"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (53:9)  This line reads literally, "and with the rich in his death." <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wytmb</FONT> combines a preposition, a plural form of the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twm</FONT>, and a third masculine singular suffix. The plural of the noun is problematic and the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wy</FONT> may be the result of virtual dittography. The form should probably be emended to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wtmb</FONT> (singular noun). The relationship between this line and the preceding one is uncertain. The parallelism appears to be synonymous (note "his grave" and "in his death"), but "criminals" and "the rich" hardly make a compatible pair in this context, for they would not be buried in the same kind of tomb. Some emend <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ryvu</FONT>, "rich," to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ur ycu</FONT>, "doers of evil," but the absence of the <i>ayin</i> is not readily explained in this graphic environment. Others suggest an emendation to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yryuc</FONT>, "he-goats, demons," but the meaning in this case is not entirely transparent and the proposal assumes that the form suffered from both transposition and the inexplicable loss of a final <i>mem</i>. Still others relate <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ryvu</FONT> to an alleged Arabic cognate meaning "mob." See <i>HALOT</i> 896. Perhaps the parallelism is antithetical, rather than synonymous. In this case, the point is made that the servant's burial in a rich man's tomb, in contrast to a criminal's burial, was appropriate, for he had done nothing wrong.<br>
 <a name="fn2249" href="isa.htm#fnB2249"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (53:9)  If the second line is antithetical, then <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu</FONT> is probably causal here, explaining why the servant was buried in a rich man's tomb, rather than that of criminal. If the first two lines are synonymous, then <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu</FONT>, is probably concessive, "even though...." <br>
 <a name="fn2250" href="isa.htm#fnB2250"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (53:10)  The meaning of this line is uncertain. It reads literally, "if you/she makes, a reparation offering, his life." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yct</FONT> could be second masculine singular,in which case it would have to be addressed to the servant or to God. However, the servant is only addressed once in this servant song (see 52:14a), and God either speaks or is spoken about in this servant song; he is never addressed. Furthermore, the idea of God himself making a reparation offering is odd. If the verb is taken as third feminine singular, then the feminine noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vpn</FONT> at the end of the line is the likely subject. In this case one can take the suffixed form of the noun as equivalent to a pronoun and translate, "if he [literally, "his life"] makes a reparation offering." <br>
 <b>sn</b> (53:10)  What constitutes the servant's reparation offering? Some might think his suffering, but the preceding context views this as past, while the verb here is imperfect in form. The offering appears to be something the servant does after his suffering has been completed. Perhaps the background of the language can be found in the levitical code, where a healed leper would offer a reparation offering as part of the ritual to achieve ceremonial cleanliness (see Lev 14). The servant was pictured earlier in the song as being severely ill. This illness (a metaphor for the effects of the people's sin) separated him from God. However, here we discover the separation is not final; once reparation is made, so to speak, he will again experience the LORD's favor.<br>
 <a name="fn2251" href="isa.htm#fnB2251"><sup>30</sup></a><b>sn</b> (53:10)  The idiomatic and stereotypical language emphasizes the servant's restoration to divine favor. Having numerous descendants and living a long life are standard signs of divine blessing. See Job 42:13-16. <br>
 <a name="fn2252" href="isa.htm#fnB2252"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn </b> (53:11) <i>Heb </i>"he will be satisfied by his knowledge," i.e., "when he knows." The preposition is understood as temporal and the suffix as a subjective genitive. Some take <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wtudyb</FONT>, "by his knowledge," with what follows and translate, "by knowledge of him," understanding the preposition as instrumental and the suffix as objective.<br>
 <a name="fn2253" href="isa.htm#fnB2253"><sup>32</sup></a><b>sn</b> (53:11)  The song ends as it began (cf. 52:13-15), with the LORD announcing the servant's vindication and exaltation.<br>
 <a name="fn2254" href="isa.htm#fnB2254"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn </b> (53:11) <i>Heb </i>"he will acquit, a righteous one, my servant, many." <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qydx</FONT> may refer to the servant, but more likely it is dittographic (note the preceding verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qydxy</FONT>). The precise meaning of the verb (the Hiphil of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qdx</FONT>) is debated. Elsewhere the Hiphil is used at least six times in the sense of "make righteous" in a legal sense, i.e., "pronounce innocent, acquit" (see Exod 23:7; Deut 25:1; 1 Kgs 8:32 = 2 Chr 6:23; Prov 17:15; Isa 5:23). It can also mean "render justice" (as a royal function, see 2 Sam 15:4; Ps 82:3), "concede" (Job 27:5), "vindicate" (Isa 50:8), and "lead to righteousness" (by teaching and example, Dan 12:3). The preceding context and the next line suggest a legal sense here. Because of his willingness to carry the people's sins, the servant is able to "acquit" them. <br>
 <b>sn</b> (53:11)  Some object to this legal interpretation of the language, arguing that it would be unjust for the righteous to suffer for the wicked and for the wicked to be declared innocent. However, such a surprising development is consistent with the ironic nature of this song. It does seem unfair for the innocent to die for the guilty. But what is God to do when all have sinned and wandered off like stray sheep (cf. v. 6)? Covenant law demands punishment, but punishment in this case would mean annihilation of what God has created. God's justice, as demanded by the law, must be satisfied. To satisfy his justice, he does something seemingly unjust. He punishes his sinless servant, the only one who has not strayed off! In the progress of biblical revelation, we discover that the sinless servant is really God in the flesh, who offers himself because he is committed to the world he has created. If his justice can only be satisfied if he himself endures the punishment, then so be it. What appears to be an act of injustice is really love satisfying the demands of justice!<br>
 <a name="fn2255" href="isa.htm#fnB2255"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (53:11)  The circumstantial clause (note the <i>vav</i> + object + subject + verb pattern) is understood as causal here. The prefixed verb form is either a preterite or an imperfect used in a customary manner.<br>

The syntactical relationship of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ydsj</FONT>, "expressions of loyalty," to the preceding line is unclear. If the term is appositional to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tyrb</FONT>, "covenant," then the LORD here transfers the promises of the Davidic covenant to the entire nation. Another option is to take <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ydsj</FONT> as an adverbial accusative and to translate, "according to the reliable covenantal promises." In this case the new covenantal arrangement proposed here is viewed as an extension or perhaps fulfillment of the Davidic promises. A third option, the one reflected in the above translation, is to take the last line as comparative. In this case the new covenant being proposed is analogous to the Davidic covenant. Verses 4-5, which compare David's international prominence to what Israel will experience, favors this view. In all three of these interpretations, "David" is an objective genitive; he is the recipient of covenantal promises. A fourth option would be to take David as a subjective genitive and understand the line as giving the basis for the preceding promise: "Then I will make an unconditional covenantal promise to you, because of David's faithful acts of covenantal loyalty."<br>

The second half of the verse observes that such apathy results in more widespread oppression. Since the next verse pictures the godly being taken to a place of rest, some interpret the second half of v. 1 in a more positive vein.

 <b>sn</b> (63:17)  How direct this hardening is, one cannot be sure. The speaker may envision direct involvement on the LORD's part. The LORD has brought the exile as judgment for the nation's sin and now he continues to keep them at arm's length by blinding them spiritually. The second half of 64:7 (ET) might support this, though the precise reading of the final verb is uncertain. On the other hand, the idiom of lament is sometimes ironic and hyperbolically deterministic. For example, Naomi lamented that Shaddai was directly opposing her and bringing her calamity (Ruth 1:20-21), while the author of Ps 88 directly attributes his horrible suffering and loneliness to God (see especially vv. 6-8, 16-18). Both individuals make little, if any, room for intermediate causes or the principle of sin and death which ravages the human race. In the same way, the speaker in Isa 63:17 (who evidences great spiritual sensitivity and is anything but "hardened") may be referring to the hardships of exile, which discouraged and even embittered the people, causing many of them to retreat from their Yahwistic faith. In this case, the "hardening" in view is more indirect and can be lifted by the LORD's intervention. Whether the hardening here is indirect or direct, it is important to recognize that the speaker sees it as one of the effects of rebellion against the LORD (note especially 64:5-6).<br>

(Note the last two lines of the verse, which suggests they are guilty of abominable practices.) On the one hand, they act pious and offer sacrifices; but at the same time they commit violent crimes against men, defile their sacrifices, and worship other gods. <br>
 <a name="fn2710" href="isa.htm#fnB2710"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn </b> (66:3) <i>Heb </i>"one who sacrifices a lamb, one who breaks a dog's neck." Some understand a comparison, but see the previous note.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (66:3)  The significance of breaking a dog's neck is uncertain, though the structure of the statement when compared to the preceding and following lines suggests the action is viewed in a negative light. According to Exod 13:13 and 34:20, one was to "redeem" a firstborn donkey by offering a lamb; if one did not "redeem" the firstborn donkey in this way, then its neck must be broken. According to Deut 21:1-9 a heifer's neck was to be broken as part of the atonement ritual to purify the land from the guilt of bloodshed. It is not certain if these passages relate in any way to the action described in Isa 66:3. <br>
