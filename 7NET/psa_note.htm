 <b>sn</b> ()  <i>Psalm 1</i>. In this wisdom psalm the author advises his audience to reject the lifestyle of the wicked and to be loyal to God. The psalmist contrasts the destiny of the wicked with that of the righteous, emphasizing that the wicked are eventually destroyed while the godly prosper under the Lord's protective care.<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="psa.htm#fnB1"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  The Hebrew noun is an abstract plural. The word often refers metonymically to the happiness that God-given security and prosperity produce (see v. 3; Pss 2:12; 34:9; 41:1; 65:4; 84:12; 89:15; 106:3; 112:1; 127:5; 128:1; 144:15).<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="psa.htm#fnB2"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Heb</i> "[Oh] the happiness [of] the man." Hebrew wisdom literature often assumes and reflects the male-oriented perspective of ancient Israelite society. The principle of the psalm is certainly applicable to all people, regardless of their gender or age. To facilitate modern application, we translate the gender and age specific "man" with the more neutral "one." (Generic "he" is employed in vv. 2-3.) Since the godly man described in the psalm is representative of followers of God (note the plural form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yqydx</FONT>, "righteous, godly," in vv. 5-6), one could translate the collective singular with the plural "those" both here and in vv. 2-3, where singular pronouns and verbal forms are utilized in the Hebrew text (cf. NRSV). However, here the singular form may emphasize that godly individuals are usually outnumbered by the wicked. Retaining the singular allows the translation to retain this emphasis.<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="psa.htm#fnB3"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Heb</i> "walk in." The three perfect verbal forms in v. 1 refer in this context to characteristic behavior. The sequence "walk-stand-sit" envisions a progression from relatively casual association with the wicked to complete identification with them.<br>
 <a name="fn4" href="psa.htm#fnB4"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  The Hebrew noun translated "advice" most often refers to the "counsel" or "advice" one receives from others. To "walk in the advice of the wicked" means to allow their evil advice to impact and determine one's behavior.<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="psa.htm#fnB5"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  In the psalms the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yuvr</FONT> ("wicked") describes people who are proud, practical atheists (Ps 10:2, 4, 11) who hate God's commands, commit sinful deeds, speak lies and slander (Ps 50:16-20), and cheat others (Ps. 37:21).<br>
 <a name="fn6" href="psa.htm#fnB6"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  "Pathway" here refers to the lifestyle of sinners. To "stand in the pathway of/with sinners" means to closely associate with them in their sinful behavior.<br>
 <a name="fn7" href="psa.htm#fnB7"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  Here the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bvwm</FONT>, although often translated "seat" (cf. NEB, NIV), appears to refer to the whole assembly of evildoers. The word also carries the semantic nuance "assembly" in Ps 107:32, where it is in synonymous parallelism with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lhq</FONT>, "assembly."<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="psa.htm#fnB8"><sup>8</sup></a> <b>tn</b> (1:1)  The Hebrew word refers to arrogant individuals (Prov 21:24) who love conflict (Prov 22:10) and vociferously reject wisdom and correction (Prov 1:22; 9:7-8; 13:1; 15:12). To "sit in the assembly" of such people means to completely identify with them in their proud, sinful plans and behavior.<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="psa.htm#fnB9"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  Here the Hebrew expression <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;a-yk</FONT> ("instead") introduces a contrast between the sinful behavior depicted in v. 1 and the godly lifestyle described in v. 2.<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="psa.htm#fnB10"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  <i>Heb</i> "his delight [is] in the law of the LORD." In light of the following line, which focuses on studying the Lord's law, one might translate, "he finds pleasure in studying the LORD's commands." However, even if one translates the line this way, it is important to recognize that mere study and intellectual awareness are not ultimately what bring divine favor. Study of the law is metonymic here for the correct attitudes and behavior that should result from an awareness of and commitment to God's moral will; thus "obeying" has been used in the translation rather than "studying."<br>
 <a name="fn11" href="psa.htm#fnB11"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  The Hebrew imperfect verbal form draws attention to the characteristic behavior described here and lends support to the hyperbolic adverbial phrase "day and night." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hgh</FONT> actually means "to recite quietly; to meditate" and refers metonymically to intense study and reflection.<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="psa.htm#fnB12"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  Or "his law."<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="psa.htm#fnB13"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  The Hebrew perfect verbal form with <i>vav</i> consecutive here carries the same characteristic force as the imperfect in the preceding verse. According to the psalmist, the one who studies and obeys God's commands typically prospers.<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="psa.htm#fnB14"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  <i>Heb</i> "channels of water."<br>
 <a name="fn15" href="psa.htm#fnB15"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  <i>Heb</i> "which."<br>
 <a name="fn16" href="psa.htm#fnB16"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  The Hebrew imperfect verbal forms in v. 3 draw attention to the typical nature of the actions/states they describe.<br>
 <a name="fn17" href="psa.htm#fnB17"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  <i>Heb</i> "in its season."<br>
 <a name="fn18" href="psa.htm#fnB18"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  Or "fade"; "wither."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:3)  The author compares the godly individual to a tree that has a rich water supply (<i>planted by flowing streams</i>), develops a strong root system, and is filled with <i>leaves</i> and <i>fruit</i>. The simile suggests that the godly have a continual source of life which in turns produces stability and uninterrupted prosperity.<br>
 <a name="fn19" href="psa.htm#fnB19"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  <i>Heb</i> "and all which he does prospers"; or "and all which he does he causes to prosper." (The simile of the tree does not extend to this line.) It is not certain if the Hiphil verbal form (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jylxy</FONT>) is intransitive-exhibitive ("prospers") or causative ("causes to prosper") here. If the verb is intransitive, then <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lk</FONT> ("all, everything") is the subject. If the verb is causative, then the godly individual or the Lord himself is the subject and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lk</FONT> is the object.  The wording is reminiscent of Josh 1:8, where the Lord tells Joshua: "This law scroll must not leave your lips! You must memorize it day and night so you can carefully obey all that is written in it. Then you will prosper (literally, "cause your way to prosper") and be successful."<br>
 <a name="fn20" href="psa.htm#fnB20"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  Here the Hebrew expression <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;a-yk</FONT> ("instead," cf. v. 2) introduces a contrast between the prosperity of the godly depicted in v. 3 and the destiny of the wicked described in v. 4.<br>
 <a name="fn21" href="psa.htm#fnB21"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  <i>Heb</i> "[they are] like the chaff which [the] wind blows about." The Hebrew imperfect verbal form draws attention to the typical nature of the action described.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:4)  <i>Wind-driven chaff</i>. In contrast to the well-rooted and productive tree described in v. 3, the wicked are like a dried up plant that has no root system and is blown away by the wind. The simile describes the destiny of the wicked (see vv. 5-6).<br>
 <a name="fn22" href="psa.htm#fnB22"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  Or "Therefore."<br>
 <a name="fn23" href="psa.htm#fnB23"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Heb</i> "arise in," but the verb is used metonymically here in the sense of "stand"; "endure," as in 1 Sam 13:14 and Job 8:15.  The negated Hebrew imperfect verbal form is here taken as indicating incapability or lack of potential, though one could understand the verb form as indicating what is typical ("do not withstand") or what will happen ("will not withstand").<br>
 <a name="fn24" href="psa.htm#fnB24"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Heb</i> "the judgment." The article indicates a judgment that is definite in the mind of the speaker. In the immediate context this probably does not refer to the "final judgment" described in later biblical revelation, but to a temporal/historical judgment which the author anticipates. Periodically during the OT period, God would come in judgment, removing the wicked from the scene, while preserving a godly remnant (see Gen 6-9; Ps 37; Hab 3).<br>
 <a name="fn25" href="psa.htm#fnB25"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Heb</i> "and sinners in the assembly (or, "circle") of [the] godly." The negative particle and verb from the preceding line are assumed by ellipsis here ("will not arise/stand").<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:5)  The <i>assembly</i>  <i>of the godly</i> is insulated from divine judgment (Ps 37:12-17, 28-29).<br>
 <a name="fn26" href="psa.htm#fnB26"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  The translation understands <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk</FONT> as asseverative. Another option is to translate "for," understanding v. 6 as a theological explanation for vv. 3-5, which contrast the respective destinies of the godly and the wicked.<br>
 <a name="fn27" href="psa.htm#fnB27"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  <i>Heb</i> "the LORD knows the way of the godly." To "know a way" means, in its most basic sense, "to recognize/acknowledge a pathway, route, or prescribed way of life" (see Josh 3:4; Job 21:14; Ps 67:2; Isa 42:16; Jer 5:4-5). Here it probably refers to the Lord recognizing the behavior of the godly and, by metonymy, rewarding their godliness with security and prosperity (hence the translation, "the LORD rewards the behavior of the godly"). Another option is to take the verb in the sense of "mark out" (cf. Job 23:10), which metonymically could mean "watch over, protect." In this case the "way of the godly" is not their behavior, but their course of life or destiny; a translation reflecting this would be "the LORD protects the lives of the godly" or "the LORD watches over the destiny of the godly" (cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV). The Hebrew active participle ("knows") has here a characteristic durative force.<br>
 <a name="fn28" href="psa.htm#fnB28"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  <i>Heb</i> "but the way of the wicked perishes." The "way of the wicked" may refer to their course of life (Ps 146:9; Prov 4:19; Jer 12:1) or their sinful behavior (Prov 12:26; 15:9). The Hebrew imperfect verbal form probably describes here what typically happens, though one could take the form as indicating what will happen ("will perish").<br>
 <a name="fn29" href="psa.htm#fnB29"><sup>29</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:6)  <i>Psalm 2</i>. In this royal psalm the author asserts the special status of the divinely chosen Davidic king and warns the nations and their rulers to submit to the authority of God and his chosen vice-regent.<br>
 <a name="fn30" href="psa.htm#fnB30"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:1)  The question is rhetorical. Rather than seeking information, the psalmist expresses his outrage that the nations would have the audacity to rebel against God and his chosen king.<br>
 <a name="fn31" href="psa.htm#fnB31"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:1)  The Hebrew verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vgr</FONT> occurs only here. In Dan 6:6, 11, 15 the Aramaic cognate verb describes several officials acting as a group. A Hebrew nominal derivative is used in Ps 55:14 of a crowd of people in the temple.<br>
 <a name="fn32" href="psa.htm#fnB32"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:1)  The interrogative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hml</FONT> ("why?") is understood by ellipsis in the second line.<br>
 <a name="fn33" href="psa.htm#fnB33"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:1)  Or "peoples."<br>
 <a name="fn34" href="psa.htm#fnB34"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:1)  The Hebrew imperfect form describes the rebellion as underway. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hgh</FONT>, which means "to recite quietly, meditate," here has the metonymic nuance "devise, plan, plot" (see Ps 38:12; Prov 24:2).<br>
 <a name="fn35" href="psa.htm#fnB35"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:1)  <i>Heb</i> "devising emptiness." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qyr</FONT> ("emptiness") may characterize their behavior as "worthless, morally bankrupt" but more likely refers to the outcome of their plots (i.e., failure). As the rest of the psalm emphasizes, their rebellion will fail.<br>
 <a name="fn36" href="psa.htm#fnB36"><sup>7</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:2)  The expression<i> kings of the earth</i> refers somewhat hyperbolically to the kings who had been conquered by and were subject to the Davidic king.<br>
 <a name="fn37" href="psa.htm#fnB37"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:2)  Or "take their stand." The Hebrew imperfect verbal form describes their action as underway.<br>
 <a name="fn38" href="psa.htm#fnB38"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:2)  Or "conspire together." The verbal form is a Niphal from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dsy</FONT>. BDB 413-14 derives the verb from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dsy</FONT> ("to establish, found"), but <i>HALOT</i> 417 proposes a homonym meaning "get together, conspire" (an alternate form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dws</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn39" href="psa.htm#fnB39"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:2)  <i>Heb</i> "and against his anointed one." The Davidic king is the referent (see vv. 6-7).<br>
 <a name="fn40" href="psa.htm#fnB40"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:3)  The words "they say" are supplied in the translation for clarification. The quotation represents the words of the rebellious kings.<br>
 <a name="fn41" href="psa.htm#fnB41"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:3)  <i>Heb</i> "their (i.e., the LORD's and the king's) shackles." The kings compare the rule of the Lord and his vice-regent to being imprisoned.<br>
 <a name="fn42" href="psa.htm#fnB42"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:3)  <i>Heb</i> "throw off from us."<br>
 <a name="fn43" href="psa.htm#fnB43"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  <i>Heb</i> "sitting." The Hebrew verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bvy</FONT> is here used metonymically of "sitting enthroned" (see Pss 9:7; 29:10; 55:19; 102:12; 123:1).<br>
 <a name="fn44" href="psa.htm#fnB44"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  As the next line indicates, this refers to derisive laughter. The Hebrew imperfect verbal forms in vv. 4-5 describe the action from the perspective of an eyewitness who is watching the divine response as it unfolds before his eyes.<br>
 <a name="fn45" href="psa.htm#fnB45"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  Or "scoffs at"; "derides"; "mocks."<br>
 <a name="fn46" href="psa.htm#fnB46"><sup>17</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:5)  <i>And terrifies them in his rage.</i> This line focuses on the effect that God's angry response (see previous line) has on the rebellious kings.<br>
 <a name="fn47" href="psa.htm#fnB47"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6)  The words "he says" are supplied in the translation for clarification. The speaker is the Lord.<br>
 <a name="fn48" href="psa.htm#fnB48"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6)  The first person pronoun appears before the first person verbal form for emphasis, reflected in the translation by "myself."<br>
 <a name="fn49" href="psa.htm#fnB49"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6)  Or perhaps "consecrated" (see <i>HALOT</i> 703).<br>
 <a name="fn50" href="psa.htm#fnB50"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:7)  The words "the king says" are supplied in the translation for clarification. The speaker is the Lord's chosen king.<br>
 <a name="fn51" href="psa.htm#fnB51"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:7)  Or "I will relate the decree. The LORD said to me" (in accordance with the Masoretic accentuation).<br>
 <a name="fn52" href="psa.htm#fnB52"><sup>23</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:7)  <i>`You are my son!'</i> The Davidic king was viewed as God's "son" (see 2 Sam 7:14; Ps 89:26-27). The idiom reflects ancient Near Eastern adoption language associated with covenants of grant, by which a lord would reward a faithful subject by elevating him to special status, referred to as "sonship." Like a son, the faithful subject received an "inheritance," viewed as an unconditional, eternal gift. Such gifts usually took the form of land and/or an enduring dynasty. See M. Weinfeld, "The Covenant of Grant in the Old Testament and in the Ancient Near East," <i>JAOS</i> 90 (1970): 184-203, for general discussion and some striking extra-biblical parallels.<br>
 <a name="fn53" href="psa.htm#fnB53"><sup>24</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:8)  <i>I will give you the nations.</i> The LORD promises the Davidic king universal dominion.<br>
 <a name="fn54" href="psa.htm#fnB54"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tc</b> (2:9)  The LXX reads "you will shepherd them." This reading, quoted in the Greek text of the NT in Rev 2:27; 12:5; 19:15, assumes a different vocalization of the consonantal Hebrew text and understands the verb as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hur</FONT> ("to shepherd") rather than <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">uur</FONT> ("to break"). But the presence of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jpn</FONT> ("to smash") in the next line strongly favors the MT vocalization.<br>
 <a name="fn55" href="psa.htm#fnB55"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:9)  The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">fb#v@</FONT> can refer to a "staff" or "rod," but here it probably refers to the Davidic king's royal scepter, symbolizing his sovereignty.<br>
 <a name="fn56" href="psa.htm#fnB56"><sup>27</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:9)  <i>Like a potter</i>'<i>s jar</i>. Before the Davidic king's awesome power, the rebellious nations are like fragile pottery.<br>
 <a name="fn57" href="psa.htm#fnB57"><sup>28</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:10)  The speaker here is either the psalmist or the Davidic king, who now addresses the rebellious <i>kings</i>.<br>
 <a name="fn58" href="psa.htm#fnB58"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:10)  The Niphal has here a tolerative nuance; the kings are urged to submit themselves to the advice being offered.<br>
 <a name="fn59" href="psa.htm#fnB59"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:11)  The Hebrew verb translated "serve" refers here to submitting to the Lord's sovereignty as expressed through the rule of the Davidic king. Such "service" would involve maintaining allegiance to the Davidic king by paying tribute on a regular basis.<br>
 <a name="fn60" href="psa.htm#fnB60"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:11)  Traditionally, "rejoice with trembling" (KJV). The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lyg</FONT> normally means "rejoice," but this meaning does not fit well here in conjunction with "in trembling." Some try to understand "trembling" (and the parallel <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hary</FONT>, "fear") in the sense of "reverential awe" and then take the verbs "serve" and "rejoice" in the sense of "worship" (cf. NASB). But <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hdur</FONT> ("trembling") and its related terms consistently refer to utter terror and fear (see Exod 15:15; Job 4:14; Pss 48:6; 55:5; 104:32; Isa 33:14; Dan 10:11) or at least great emotional distress (Ezra 10:9). It seems more likely here that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lyg</FONT> carries its polarized meaning "mourn, lament," as in Hos 10:5. "Mourn, lament" would then be metonymic in this context for "repent" (referring to one's rebellious ways). On the meaning of the verb in Hos 10:5, see F. I. Andersen and D. N. Freedman, <i>Hosea</i>, 556-57.<br>
 <a name="fn61" href="psa.htm#fnB61"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:12)  Traditionally, "kiss the son" (KJV). But <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rb^</FONT> is the Aramaic word for "son," not the Hebrew. For this reason many regard the reading as suspect. Some propose emendations of vv. 11b-12a. One of the more popular proposals is to read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wylgrl wqvn hdurb</FONT>, "in trembling kiss his feet." It makes better sense to understand <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rb^</FONT> as an adjective meaning "pure" (see Pss 24:4; 73:1 and BDB 141) functioning here in an adverbial sense. If read this way, then the syntactical structure of exhortation (imperative followed by adverbial modifier) corresponds to the two preceding lines (see v. 11). The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qvn</FONT> ("kiss") refers metonymically to showing homage (see 1 Sam 10:1; Hos 13:2). The exhortation in v. 12a advocates a genuine expression of allegiance and warns against insincerity. When swearing allegiance, vassal kings would sometimes do so insincerely, with the intent of rebelling when the time was right. The so-called "Vassal Treaties of Esarhaddon" also warn against such an attitude. In this treaty the vassal is told: "If you, as you stand on the soil where this oath [is sworn], swear the oath with your words and lips [only], do not swear with your entire heart, do not transmit it to your sons who will live after this treaty, if you take this <i>curse</i> upon yourselves but do not plan to keep the treaty of Esarhaddon...may your sons and grandsons because of this fear in the future" (see J. B. Pritchard, ed., <i>The Ancient Near East</i>, 2:62).<br>
 <a name="fn62" href="psa.htm#fnB62"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:12)  Throughout the translation of this verse the third person masculine pronouns refer to the LORD (cf. v. 11).<br>
 <a name="fn63" href="psa.htm#fnB63"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:12)  The implied subject of the verb is the LORD, mentioned in v. 11. Elsewhere the subject of this verb is consistently the LORD, suggesting it may be a technical term for divine anger. Anger is here used metoymically for judgment, as the following statement makes clear. A Moabite cognate occurs in the Mesha inscription, where it is used of the Moabite god Chemosh's anger at his people (see J. B. Pritchard, ed., <i>The Ancient Near East</i>, 1:209).<br>
 <a name="fn64" href="psa.htm#fnB64"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:12)  <i>Heb</i> "and you will perish [in the] way." The Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ird</FONT> ("way") here refers to their rebellious behavior (not to a pathway, as often understood). It functions syntactically as an adverbial accusative in relation to the verb "perish."<br>
 <a name="fn65" href="psa.htm#fnB65"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:12)  Or "burns." The LORD's anger is compared here to fire, the most destructive force known in ancient Israel.<br>
 <a name="fn66" href="psa.htm#fnB66"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:12)  The Hebrew noun translated "happy" is an abstract plural. The word often refers metonymically to the happiness that God-given security and prosperity produce (see Pss 1:1; 34:9; 41:1; 65:4; 84:12; 89:15; 106:3; 112:1; 127:5; 128:1; 144:15).<br>
 <a name="fn67" href="psa.htm#fnB67"><sup>38</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:12)  <i>Who take shelter in him</i>. "Taking shelter" in the Lord is an idiom for seeking his protection. Seeking his protection presupposes and even demonstrates the subject's loyalty to the Lord. In the psalms those who "take shelter" in the Lord are contrasted with the wicked and equated with those who love, fear, and serve the Lord (Pss 5:11-12; 31:17-20; 34:21-22).<br>
 <a name="fn68" href="psa.htm#fnB68"><sup>39</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:12)  <i>Psalm 3</i>. The psalmist acknowledges that he is confronted by many enemies (vv. 1-2). But, alluding to a divine oracle he has received (vv. 4-5), he affirms his confidence in God's ability to protect him (vv. 3, 6) and requests that God make his promise a reality (vv. 7-8).<br>
 <a name="fn69" href="psa.htm#fnB69"><sup>40</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:12)  According to Jewish tradition, David offered this prayer when he was forced to flee from Jerusalem during his son Absalom's attempted coup (see 2 Sam 15:13-17).<br>
 <a name="fn70" href="psa.htm#fnB70"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:1)  The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm</FONT> ("how") is used here as an adverbial exclamation (see BDB 553).<br>
 <a name="fn71" href="psa.htm#fnB71"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:1)  <i>Heb</i> "many rise up against me."<br>
 <a name="fn72" href="psa.htm#fnB72"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:2)  Heb "there is no deliverance for him in God."<br>

 <a name="fn75" href="psa.htm#fnB75"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:3)  <i>Heb</i> "my glory," or "my honor." The psalmist affirms that the LORD is his source of honor, i.e., the one who gives him honor in the sight of others. According to BDB (459), the phrase refers to God as the one to whom the psalmist gives honor. But the the immediate context focuses on what God does for the psalmist, not vice-versa.<br>
 <a name="fn76" href="psa.htm#fnB76"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:3)  <i>Heb</i> "[the one who] lifts my head." The weary psalmist's "head is down," but he is confident the LORD "will lift his head" by giving him renewed physical strength and emotional vigor (see Ps 110:7). Since the figure of "lifting the head" could be understood in various ways by the modern reader, the less ambiguous "give me renewed strength" has been used in the translation.<br>
 <a name="fn77" href="psa.htm#fnB77"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:4)  The prefixed verbal form could be an imperfect, yielding the translation "I cry out," but the verb form in the next line (a <i>vav</i> consecutive with the preterite) suggests this is a brief narrative of what has already happened. Consequently the verb form in v. 4a is better understood as a preterite, "I cried out." (For another example of the preterite of this same verb form, see Ps 30:8.) Sometime after the crisis arose, the psalmist prayed to the Lord and received an assuring answer. Now he confidently awaits the fulfillment of the divine promise.<br>
 <a name="fn78" href="psa.htm#fnB78"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:4)  <i>His holy hill</i>. That is, Zion (see Pss 2:6; 48:1-2). The psalmist recognizes that the LORD dwells in his sanctuary on Mount Zion.<br>
 <a name="fn79" href="psa.htm#fnB79"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:5)  The three verbal forms that appear in succession here (perfect + <i>vav</i> consecutive with preterite + perfect) are most naturally taken as narrational. When the psalmist received an assuring word from the LORD, he was able to sleep calmly. Because the LORD was protecting him, he awoke safely from his sleep.<br>
 <a name="fn80" href="psa.htm#fnB80"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:5)  Or "supports"; "sustains." In this explanatory causal clause the imperfect verbal form probably has a habitual or present progressive nuance, for the psalmist is confident of God's continual protection (see v. 3). Another option is to take the verb as a preterite, "for the LORD protected me." In this case, the psalmist focuses specifically on the protection God provided while he slept.<br>
 <a name="fn81" href="psa.htm#fnB81"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:6)  The imperfect verbal form here expresses the psalmist's continuing attitude as he faces the crisis at hand.<br>

 <a name="fn84" href="psa.htm#fnB84"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:7)  In v. 2 the psalmist describes his enemies as those who "confront" him (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ymq</FONT>, literally, "rise up against him"). Now, using the same verbal root (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;wq</FONT>) he asks the LORD to rise up (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmwq</FONT>) in his defense.<br>
 <a name="fn85" href="psa.htm#fnB85"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:7)  Elsewhere in the psalms the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk</FONT>, when collocated with a perfect verbal form and subordinated to a preceding imperative directed to God, almost always has an explanatory or causal force ("for, because") and introduces a motivating argument for why God should respond positively to the request (see Pss 5:10; 6:2; 12:1; 16:1; 41:4; 55:9; 56:1; 57:1; 60:2; 69:1; 74:20; 119:94; 123:3; 142:6; 143:8). (On three occasions the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk</FONT> is recitative after a verb of perception ["see/know that," see Pss 4:3; 25:19; 119:159]). If <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk</FONT> is taken as explanatory here, then the psalmist is arguing that God should deliver him now because that is what God characteristically does. However, such a motivating argument is not used in the passages cited above. The motivating argument usually focuses on the nature of the psalmist's dilemma or the fact that he trusts in the Lord. For this reason it is unlikely that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk</FONT> has its normal force here. Most scholars understand the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk</FONT> as having an asseverative (emphasizing) function here ("indeed, yes"; NEB leaves the particle untranslated).<br>
 <a name="fn86" href="psa.htm#fnB86"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:7)  If the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk</FONT> is taken as explanatory, then the perfect verbal forms in v. 7b would describe God's characteristic behavior. However, as pointed out in the preceding note on the word "yes," the particle probably has an asseverative force here. If so, the perfects may be taken as indicating rhetorically the psalmist's certitude and confidence that God will intervene. The psalmist is so confident of God's positive response to his prayer, he can describe God's assault on his enemies as if it had already happened. Such confidence is consistent with the mood of the psalm, as expressed before (vv. 3-6) and after this (v. 8). Another option is to take the perfects as precative, expressing a wish or request ("Strike all my enemies on the jaw, break the teeth of the wicked"). See <i>IBHS</i> 494-95. However, not all grammarians are convinced that the perfect is used as a precative in biblical Hebrew.<br>
 <a name="fn87" href="psa.htm#fnB87"><sup>18</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:7)  The expression <i>break the teeth</i> may envision violent hand-to hand combat, though it is possible that the enemies are pictured here as a dangerous animal (see Job 29:17).<br>
 <a name="fn88" href="psa.htm#fnB88"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:7)  In the psalms the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yuvr</FONT> ("wicked") describes people who are proud, practical atheists (Ps 10:2, 4, 11) who hate God's commands, commit sinful deeds, speak lies and slander (Ps 50:16-20), and cheat others (Ps. 37:21). They oppose God and his people.<br>
 <a name="fn89" href="psa.htm#fnB89"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:8)  <i>Heb</i> "to the LORD [is] deliverance."<br>
 <a name="fn90" href="psa.htm#fnB90"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:8)  <i>Heb</i> "upon your people [is] your blessing." In this context God's "blessing" includes deliverance/protection, vindication, and sustained life (see Pss 21:3, 6; 24:5).<br>
 <a name="fn91" href="psa.htm#fnB91"><sup>22</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:8)  <i>Psalm 4</i>. The psalmist asks God to hear his prayer, expresses his confidence that the Lord will intervene, and urges his enemies to change their ways and place their trust in God.

 <a name="fn92" href="psa.htm#fnB92"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:1)  <i>Heb</i> "God of my vindication."<br>

The function of the Hebrew perfect verbal form here is uncertain. The translation above assumes that the psalmist is expressing his certitude and confidence that God will intervene. The psalmist is so confident of God's positive response to his prayer, he can describe God's deliverance as if it had already happened. Such confidence is consistent with the mood of the psalm (vv. 3, 8). Another option is to take the perfects as precative, expressing a wish or request ("lead me"). See <i>IBHS</i> 494-95.

 <a name="fn100" href="psa.htm#fnB100"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:2)  Heb "a lie." Some see the metonymic language of v. 2b ("emptiness, lie") as referring to idols or false gods. However, there is no solid immediate contextual evidence for such an interpretation. It is more likely that the psalmist addresses those who threaten him (see v. 1) and refers in a general way to their sinful lifestyle. (See <i>TDOT</i>, 7:121.) The two terms allude to the fact that sinful behavior is ultimately fruitless and self-destructive.  <br>

 <a name="fn102" href="psa.htm#fnB102"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:3)  <i>Heb</i> "that the LORD sets apart a faithful one for himself." The psalmist states a general principle, though the singular form and the parallel line indicate he has himself in mind as the representative faithful follower. A <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dysj</FONT>, "faithful follower," is one who does what is right in God's eyes and remains faithful to God (see Pss 12:1; 18:25; 31:23; 37:28; 86:2; 97:10).<br>

The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wmd</FONT> is understood as a form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;md</FONT>, "wail, lament" (see KB, 226) in sorrow and repentance. Another option is to take the verb from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;md</FONT>, "be quiet" (see BDB, 198), in which case one might translate, "Do some quiet soul-searching as you lie in bed."  <br>

The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hsn</FONT> is apparently an alternate form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">acn</FONT>, "lift up." See GKC, 217, para 76b. The idiom "light of your face" probably refers to a smile (see Eccl 8:1), which in turn suggests favor and blessing (see Num 6:25; Pss 31:16; 44:3; 67:1; 80:3, 7, 19; 89:15; Dan 9:17).<br>

Sheol was envisioned as a dark region within the earth, the entrance to which was the grave with its steep slopes (cf. Ps 88:4-6). The enemies' victims are pictured here as slipping down a steep slope (the enemies' tongues) and falling into an open grave (their throat) that terminates in destruction in the inner recesses of Sheol (their stomach). The enemies' <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">brq</FONT> ("inward part") refers here to their thoughts and motives, which are destructive in their intent (see BDB 899). The throat is where these destructive thoughts are transformed into words, and their tongue is what they use to speak the deceitful words that lead their innocent victims to their demise.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (5:9)  As the psalmist walks down the path in which God leads him, he asks the LORD to guide his steps and remove danger from the path (v. 8), because he knows his enemies have "dug a grave" for him and are ready to use their deceitful words to "swallow him up" like the realm of death (i.e., Sheol) and bring him to ruin.<br>

 <a name="fn158" href="psa.htm#fnB158"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:12)  <i>Heb</i> "surround." In 1 Sam 23:26 the verb describes how Saul and his men hemmed David in as they chased him.<br>
 <a name="fn159" href="psa.htm#fnB159"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:12)  <i>Heb</i> "him." The singular form is used here in a collective or representative sense and is thus translated "them."<br>
 <a name="fn160" href="psa.htm#fnB160"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:12)  Or "with favor" (cf. NRSV). There is no preposition before the noun in the Hebrew text, nor is there a pronoun attached.

 <a name="fn161" href="psa.htm#fnB161"><sup>47</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:12)  <i>Psalm 6</i>. The psalmist begs the Lord to withdraw his anger and spare his life. Having received a positive response to his prayer, the psalmist then confronts his enemies and describes how they retreat.<br>

 <a name="fn163" href="psa.htm#fnB163"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (6:1)  The implication is that the psalmist has sinned, causing God to discipline him by bringing a life-threatening illness upon him (see vv. 2-7).<br>

 <a name="fn165" href="psa.htm#fnB165"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:2)  Normally the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lhb</FONT> refers to an emotional response and means "tremble with fear, be terrified" (see vv. 3, 10). Perhaps here the "bones" are viewed as the seat of the psalmist's emotions. However, the verb may describe one of the effects of his physical ailment, perhaps a fever. In Ezek 7:27 the verb describes how the hands of the people will shake with fear when they experience the horrors of divine judgment.<br>
 <a name="fn166" href="psa.htm#fnB166"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:3)  <i>Heb</i> "my being is very terrified." The suffixed form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vpn</FONT> ("being") is often equivalent to a pronoun in poetic texts.<br>

 <a name="fn170" href="psa.htm#fnB170"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:5)  <i>Heb</i> "for there is not in death your remembrance." The Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rkz</FONT> ("remembrance") here refers to the name of the Lord as invoked in liturgy and praise. See <i>HALOT</i> 271 and Pss 30:4; 97:12. "Death" here refers to the realm of death where the dead reside. See the reference to Sheol in the next line.<br>
 <a name="fn171" href="psa.htm#fnB171"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:5)  The rhetorical question anticipates the answer, "no one."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (6:5)  <i>In Sheol who gives you thanks?</i> According to the OT, those who descend into the realm of death/Sheol are cut off from God's mighty deeds and from the worshiping covenant community that experiences divine intervention (Pss 30:9; 88:10-12; Isa 38:18). In his effort to elicit a positive divine response, the psalmist reminds God that he will receive no praise or glory if he allows the psalmist to die. Dead men do not praise God!<br>

 <a name="fn179" href="psa.htm#fnB179"><sup>17</sup></a><b>sn</b> (6:8)  <i>The </i>LORD<i> has heard</i>. The psalmist's mood abruptly changes because the LORD responded positively to the lament and petition of vv. 1-7 and promised him deliverance.<br>
 <a name="fn180" href="psa.htm#fnB180"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:9)  The prefixed verbal form is probably a preterite here; it is parallel to a perfect and refers to the fact that the LORD has responded favorably to the psalmist's request.<br>
 <a name="fn181" href="psa.htm#fnB181"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:10)  The four prefixed verbal forms in this verse are understood as jussives. The psalmist concludes his prayer with an imprecation, calling judgment down on his enemies.<br>
 <a name="fn182" href="psa.htm#fnB182"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:10)  <i>Heb</i> "and may they be very terrified." The psalmist uses the same expression in v. 3 to describe the terror he was experiencing. Now he asks the LORD to turn the tables and cause his enemies to know what absolute terror feels like.<br>
 <a name="fn183" href="psa.htm#fnB183"><sup>21</sup></a><b>sn</b> (6:10)  <i>Psalm 7</i>. The psalmist asks the Lord to intervene and deliver him from his enemies. He protests his innocence and declares his confidence in God's justice.<br>
 <a name="fn184" href="psa.htm#fnB184"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:10)  The precise meaning of the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/oyG&#180;v!</FONT> (translated here "musical composition") is uncertain. Some derive the noun from the verbal root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hgv</FONT>, "swerve, reel," and understand it as referring to a "wild, passionate song, with rapid changes of rhythm" (see BDB 993). But this proposal is purely speculative. The only other appearance of the noun is in Hab 3:1, where it occurs in the plural.<br>
 <a name="fn185" href="psa.htm#fnB185"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:10)  Or,"on account of."<br>
 <a name="fn186" href="psa.htm#fnB186"><sup>24</sup></a><b>sn</b> (6:10)  Apparently this individual named <i>Cush</i> was one of David's enemies.<br>
 <a name="fn187" href="psa.htm#fnB187"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:1)  The Hebrew perfect verbal form probably refers here to a completed action with continuing results.<br>
 <a name="fn188" href="psa.htm#fnB188"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:2)  The verb is singular in the Hebrew text, even though "all who chase me" in v. 1 refers to a whole group of enemies. The singular is also used in vv. 4-5, but the psalmist returns to the plural in v. 6. The singular is probably collective, emphasizing the united front that the psalmist's enemies present. This same alternation between a collective singular and a plural referring to enemies appears in Pss 9:3, 6; 13:4; 31:4, 8; 41:6, 10-11; 42:9-10; 55:3; 64:1-2; 74:3-4; 89:22-23; 106:10-11; 143:3, 6, 9.<br>
 <a name="fn189" href="psa.htm#fnB189"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:2)  <i>Heb</i> "my life." The pronominal suffix attached to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vpn</FONT> is equivalent to a personal pronoun. See Ps 6:3.<br>
 <a name="fn190" href="psa.htm#fnB190"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:2)  <i>Heb</i> "tearing and there is no one rescuing." The verbal form translated "tearing" is a singular active participle.<br>
 <a name="fn191" href="psa.htm#fnB191"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:3)  <i>Heb</i> "if I have done this."<br>
 <a name="fn192" href="psa.htm#fnB192"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:3)  <i>Heb</i> "if there is injustice in my hands." The "hands" figuratively suggest deeds or actions.<br>
 <a name="fn193" href="psa.htm#fnB193"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:4)  <i>Heb</i> "if I have repaid the one at peace with me evil." The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ymlwv</FONT> ("the one at peace with me") probably refers to a close friend or ally, i.e., one with whom the psalmist has made a formal agreement. See BDB 1023.<br>
 <a name="fn194" href="psa.htm#fnB194"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:4)  <i>Heb</i> "or rescued my enemy in vain." The preterite with <i>vav</i> consecutive (the verb form is pseudo-cohortative, see <i>IBHS</i> 576-77) carries on the hypothetical nuance of the perfect in the preceding line. Some regard the statement as a parenthetical assertion that the psalmist is kind to his enemies. Others define <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jlj</FONT> as "despoil" (cf. NASB, NRSV "plundered"; NIV "robbed"), an otherwise unattested nuance for this verb. Still others emend the verb to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jjl</FONT>, "oppress." Most construe the adverb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;qyr</FONT>, "emptily, vainly," with "my enemy," i.e., the one who is my enemy in vain." The present translation (1) assumes an emendation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yr]r+ox</FONT>, "my enemy," to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">orr+ox</FONT>, "his (i.e., the psalmist's ally's) enemy," (2) understands the final <i>mem</i> on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;qyr</FONT> as enclitic, and (3) takes <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qyr</FONT> as an adjective modifying "his enemy." (For other examples of a suffixed noun followed by an attributive adjective without the article, see Pss 18:17 ("my strong enemy"), 99:3 ("your great and awesome name") and 143:10 ("your good spirit"). The adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qyr</FONT> occurs with the sense "lawless" in Judg 9:4; 11:3; 2 Chr 13:7. In this case the psalmist affirms that he has not wronged his ally, nor has he given aid to his ally's enemies. Ancient Near Eastern treaties typically included such clauses, with one or both parties agreeing not to lend aid to the treaty partner's enemies.<br>
 <a name="fn195" href="psa.htm#fnB195"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:5)  The vocalization of the verb form seems to be a mixture of Qal and Piel (see GKC &#167;63.<i>n</i>). The translation assumes the Piel, which would emphasize the repetitive nature of the action. The translation assumes the prefixed verbal form is a jussive. The psalmist is so certain that he is innocent of the sins mentioned in vv. 3-4, he pronounces an imprecation on himself for rhetorical effect.<br>
 <a name="fn196" href="psa.htm#fnB196"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:5)  <i>Heb</i> "my life." The pronominal suffix attached to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vpn</FONT> is equivalent to a personal pronoun. See Ps 6:3.<br>
 <a name="fn197" href="psa.htm#fnB197"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:5)  <i>Heb</i> "and may he overtake." The prefixed verbal form is distinctly jussive. The object "me," though unexpressed, is understood from the preceding statement.<br>
 <a name="fn198" href="psa.htm#fnB198"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:5)  <i>Heb</i> "and may he trample down to the earth my life."<br>
 <a name="fn199" href="psa.htm#fnB199"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:5)  <i>Heb</i> "and my honor in the dust may he cause to dwell." The prefixed verbal form is distinctly jussive. Some emend <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yd]obk=</FONT>, "my honor," to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yd]b@k=</FONT>, "my liver" (as the seat of life, see <i>HALOT</i> 456), but the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yd]obk=</FONT> is to be retained since it probably refers to the psalmist's dignity or honor.<br>
 <a name="fn200" href="psa.htm#fnB200"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:6)  <i>Heb</i> "in your anger."<br>
 <a name="fn201" href="psa.htm#fnB201"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:6)  <i>Heb</i> "Lift yourself up in the angry outbursts of my enemies." Many understand the preposition prefixed to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twrbu</FONT>, "angry outbursts," as adversative, "against," and the following genitive "enemies" as subjective. In this case one could translate, "spring into action against my furious enemies" (cf. NIV, NRSV). The present translation, however, takes the preposition as indicating manner (cf. "in your anger" in the previous line) and understands the plural form of the noun as indicating an abstract quality ("fury") or excessive degree ("raging fury"). Cf. Job 21:30.<br>
 <a name="fn202" href="psa.htm#fnB202"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tc</b> (7:6)  <i>Heb</i> "Wake up to me [with the] judgment [which] you have commanded." The LXX understands <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yl!a@</FONT>, "my God," instead of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yl^a@</FONT>, "to me." (The LXX reading is followed by NEB, NIV, NRSV.) If the reading of the MT is retained, the preposition probably has the sense of "on account of, for the sake of." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">fpvm</FONT> ("judgment") is probably an adverbial accusative, modifying the initial imperative, "wake up." In this case <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tywx</FONT> ("[which] you have commanded") is an asyndetic relative clause. Some take the perfect as precative. In this case one could translate the final line, "Wake up for my sake! Decree judgment!" (cf. NIV). However, not all grammarians are convinced that the perfect is used as a precative in biblical Hebrew.<br>
 <a name="fn203" href="psa.htm#fnB203"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:7)  <i>Heb</i> "and the assembly of the peoples surrounds you." Some understand the prefixed verbal form as a jussive, "may the assembly of the peoples surround you."<br>
 <a name="fn204" href="psa.htm#fnB204"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:7)  <i>Heb</i> "over it (the feminine suffix refers back to the feminine noun "assembly" in the preceding line) on high return." Some emend <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb*Wv</FONT>, "return," to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb*v@</FONT>, "sit [in judgment]," because they find the implication of "return" problematic. But the psalmist does not mean to imply that God has abandoned his royal throne and needs to regain it. Rather he simply urges God, as sovereign king of the world, to once more occupy his royal seat of judgment and execute judgment, as the OT pictures God doing periodically.<br>
 <a name="fn205" href="psa.htm#fnB205"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:8)  <i>The </i>LORD<i> judges the nations</i>. In hyperbolic fashion the psalmist pictures the nations assembled around the divine throne (v. 7a). He urges God to take his rightful place on the throne (v. 7b) and then pictures him making judicial decisions that vindicate the innocent (see vv. 8-16).<br>
 <a name="fn206" href="psa.htm#fnB206"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:8)  <i>Heb</i> "judge me, O LORD, according to my innocence."<br>
 <a name="fn207" href="psa.htm#fnB207"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:8)  <i>Heb</i> "according to my blamelessness." The imperative verb translated "vindicate" governs the second line as well.<br>
 <a name="fn208" href="psa.htm#fnB208"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:8)  The Hebrew form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ylu</FONT> has been traditionally understood as the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu</FONT> ("over") with a first person suffix. But this is syntactically awkward and meaningless. The form is probably a divine title derived from the verbal root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlu</FONT>, "ascend."  This relatively rare title appears elsewhere in the OT (see <i>HALOT</i> 824-25, though this text is not listed) and in Ugaritic as an epithet for Baal (see J. C. L. Gibson, <i>Canaanite Myths and Legends</i>, 98). See M. Dahood, <i>Psalms</i>, 1:44-45, and P. C. Craigie, <i>Psalms 1-50</i>, 98.<br>
 <a name="fn209" href="psa.htm#fnB209"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:9)  In the psalms the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yuvr</FONT> ("wicked") describes people who are proud, practical atheists (Ps 10:2, 4, 11) who hate God's commands, commit sinful deeds, speak lies and slander (Ps 50:16-20), and cheat others (Ps. 37:21). They oppose God and his people.<br>
 <a name="fn210" href="psa.htm#fnB210"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:9)  The prefixed verbal form is a jussive, expressing an imprecation here.<br>
 <a name="fn211" href="psa.htm#fnB211"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:9)  Or "the godly" (see Ps 5:12). The singular form is collective (see the plural "upright in heart" in v. 10), though it may reflect the personal focus of the psalmist in this context.<br>
 <a name="fn212" href="psa.htm#fnB212"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:9)  The prefixed verbal form expresses the psalmist's prayer or wish.<br>
 <a name="fn213" href="psa.htm#fnB213"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:9)  For other uses of the verb in this sense, see Job 7:18; Pss 11:4; 26:2; 139:23.<br>
 <a name="fn214" href="psa.htm#fnB214"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:9)  <i>Heb</i> "and [the one who] tests hearts and kidneys, just God." The translation inverts the word order to improve the English style. The heart and kidneys were viewed as the seat of one's volition, conscience, and moral character (see BDB 525 and 480 respectively).<br>
 <a name="fn215" href="psa.htm#fnB215"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:10)  Traditionally, "my shield is upon God" (cf. NASB). As in v. 8, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu</FONT> should be understood as a divine title, here compounded with "God" (cf. NIV, "God Most High"). See M. Dahood, <i>Psalms</i>, 1:45-46. The shield metaphor pictures God as a protector against deadly attacks.<br>
 <a name="fn216" href="psa.htm#fnB216"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:10)  <i>Heb</i> "pure of heart." The "heart" is here viewed as the seat of one's moral character and motives. The "pure of heart" are God's faithful followers who trust in and love the Lord and, as a result, experience his deliverance (see Pss 11:2; 32:11; 36:10; 64:10; 94:15; 97:11).<br>
 <a name="fn217" href="psa.htm#fnB217"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:11)  <i>Heb</i> "God (the divine name <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la</FONT> is used) is angry during all the day." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;uz</FONT> means "be indignant, be angry, curse." Here it refers metonymically to the judgment that originates in God's angry response to wrongdoing and injustice.<br>
 <a name="fn218" href="psa.htm#fnB218"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:12)  <i>Heb</i> "If he"; the referent (a person who is a sinner) has been specified in the translation for clarity. The subject of the first verb is understood as the sinner who fails to repent of his ways and becomes the target of God's judgment (vv. 9, 14-16).<br>
 <a name="fn219" href="psa.htm#fnB219"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:12)  <i>Heb</i> "if he does not return, his sword he sharpens." The referent (God) of the pronominal subject of the second verb ("sharpens") has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn220" href="psa.htm#fnB220"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:12)  <i>Heb</i> "his bow he treads and prepares it." "Treading the bow" involved stepping on one end of it in order to string it and thus prepare it for battle.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (7:14)  <i>Pregnant with wickedness...gives birth to harmful lies</i>. The psalmist metaphorically pictures the typical sinner as a pregnant woman, who is ready to give birth to wicked, destructive schemes and actions.<br>
 <a name="fn224" href="psa.htm#fnB224"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:15)  <i>Heb</i> "a pit he digs and he excavates it." Apparently the imagery of hunting is employed; the wicked sinner digs this pit to entrap and destroy his intended victim. The redundancy in the Hebrew text has been simplified in the translation.<br>
 <a name="fn225" href="psa.htm#fnB225"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:15)  The verb forms in vv. 15-16 describe the typical behavior and destiny of those who attempt to destroy others.

 <a name="fn226" href="psa.htm#fnB226"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:16)  <i>Heb</i> "his harm [i.e., the harm he conceived for others, see v. 14] returns on his head."<br>

 <a name="fn229" href="psa.htm#fnB229"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:17)  <i>Heb</i> "[to] the name of the LORD Most High." God's "name" refers metonymically to his divine characteristics as suggested by his name, in this case the compound "LORD Most High." The divine title "Most High" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/oyl=u#</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u#l=yo/</FONT>) pictures God as the exalted ruler of the universe who vindicates the innocent and judges the wicked.

The introductory <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> ("which") can be taken as a relative pronoun ("you who") or as a causal conjunction ("because"). One may literally translate, "you who [or, "because you"] place your majesty upon the heavens." For other uses of the phrase "place majesty upon" see Num 27:20 and 1 Chr 29:25.<br>

Perhaps the point is this: In response to the frightened cries that come from the mouths of helpless infants when God's enemies threaten them, the Lord intervenes and protects them.<br>
 <a name="fn238" href="psa.htm#fnB238"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:2)  <i>Heb</i> "to cause to cease an enemy and an avenger." The singular forms are collective. The Hitpael participle of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;qn</FONT> also occurs in Ps 44:16.<br>

 <a name="fn245" href="psa.htm#fnB245"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:5)  <i>Heb</i> "and you make him lack a little from [the] gods [or "God"]." The Piel form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rsj</FONT>, "to decrease, to be devoid," is used only here and in Eccl 4:8, where it means "to deprive, to cause to be lacking." The prefixed verbal form with <i>vav</i> consecutive either carries on the characteristic nuance of the imperfect in v. 5b or indicates a consequence ("so that you make him...") of the preceding statement (see GKC &#167;111.<i>m</i>). Some prefer to make this an independent clause and translate it as a new sentence, "You made him...." In this case the statement might refer specifically to the creation of the first human couple, Adam and Eve (cf. Gen 1:26-27). The psalmist does appear to allude to Gen 1:26-27, where mankind is created in the image of God and his angelic assembly (note "let <i>us</i> make man in <i>our</i> image" in Gen 1:26). However, the psalmist's statement need not be limited in its focus to that historical event, for all mankind shares the image imparted to the first human couple. Consequently the psalmist can speak in general terms of the exalted nature of mankind. The referent of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yhla</FONT> (<i>elohim</i>, "God" or "the heavenly beings") is unclear. Some understand this as a reference to God alone, but the allusion to Gen 1:26-27 suggests a broader referent, including God and the other heavenly beings (known in other texts as "angels"). The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yhla</FONT> (<i>elohim</i>) is also used in this way in Gen 3:5, where the serpent says to the woman, "you will be like the heavenly beings who know good and evil." (Note Gen 3:22, where God says, "the man has become like <i>one of us</i><b>.</b>") Also <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yhla</FONT> (<i>elohim</i>) may refer to the members of the heavenly assembly in Ps 82:1, 6. The LXX (the ancient Greek translation of the OT) reads "angels" in Ps 8:5 (this is the source of the quotation of Ps 8:5 in Heb 2:7).<br>

 <a name="fn256" href="psa.htm#fnB256"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:9)  Using the poetic device of inclusio, the psalmist ends the psalm the way he began it. The concluding refrain is identical to v. 1.<br>
 <a name="fn257" href="psa.htm#fnB257"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:9)  <i>Psalm 9</i>. The psalmist, probably speaking on behalf of Israel or Judah, praises God for delivering him from hostile nations. He celebrates God's sovereignty and justice, and calls on others to join him in boasting of God's greatness. Many Hebrew MSS and the ancient Greek version (LXX) combine Psalms 9 and 10 into a single psalm.<br>
 <a name="fn258" href="psa.htm#fnB258"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tc</b> (8:9)  The meaning of the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twmlu</FONT> is uncertain.

The phrase probably refers to a particular tune or musical style.<br>
 <a name="fn259" href="psa.htm#fnB259"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:1)  The cohortative forms in vv. 1-2 express the psalmist's resolve to praise God publicly.<br>
 <a name="fn260" href="psa.htm#fnB260"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:2)  <i>Heb</i> "[to] your name, O Most High." God's "name" refers metonymically to his divine characteristics as suggested by his name, in this case "Most High." This divine title (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/oyl=u#</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u#l=yo/</FONT>) pictures God as the exalted ruler of the universe who vindicates the innocent and judges the wicked. See especially Ps 47:2.<br>
 <a name="fn261" href="psa.htm#fnB261"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:3)  Or "perish"; or "die." The imperfect verbal forms in this line either emphasize what typically happens or describe vividly the aftermath of a recent battle in which the LORD defeated the psalmist's enemies.<br>
 <a name="fn262" href="psa.htm#fnB262"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:4)  <i>Heb</i> "for you accomplished my justice and my legal claim."<br>
 <a name="fn263" href="psa.htm#fnB263"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:4)  <i>Heb</i> "you sat on a throne [as] one who judges [with] righteousness." The perfect verbal forms in v. 4 probably allude to a recent victory (see vv. 5-7). Another option is to understand the verbs as describing what is typical ("you defend...you sit on a throne").<br>
 <a name="fn264" href="psa.htm#fnB264"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:5)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rug</FONT> is often understood to mean "rebuke" and in this context taken to refer to the LORD's "rebuke" of the nations. In some cases it is apparent that scolding or threatening is in view (see Gen 37:10; Ruth 2:16; Zech 3:2). However, in militaristic contexts this translation is inadequate, for the verb refers in this setting to the warrior's battle cry, which terrifies and paralyzes the enemy. See <i>TDOT</i> 3:53, and note the use of the verb in Pss 68:30; 106:9; and Nah 1:4, as well as the related noun in Job 26:11; Pss 18:15; 76:6; 104:7; Isa 50:2; 51:20; 66:15.<br>
 <a name="fn265" href="psa.htm#fnB265"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:5)  The singular form is collective (note "nations" and "their name"). In the psalms the "wicked" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yuvr</FONT>) are typically proud, practical atheists (Ps 10:2, 4, 11) who hate God's commands, commit sinful deeds, speak lies and slander (Ps 50:16-20), and cheat others (Ps. 37:21). In this context the hostile nations who threaten Israel/Judah are in view.<br>
 <a name="fn266" href="psa.htm#fnB266"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:5)  <i>Heb</i> "their name you wiped out forever and ever." The three perfect verbal forms in v. 5 probably refer to a recent victory (definite past or present perfect use), although they might express what is typical (characteristic use).<br>
 <a name="fn267" href="psa.htm#fnB267"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:6)  <i>Heb</i> "the enemy--they have come to an end [in] ruins permanently." The singular form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bywa</FONT> ("enemy") is collective. It is placed at the beginning of the verse to heighten the contrast with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwhy</FONT>, "the LORD," in v. 7.<br>
 <a name="fn268" href="psa.htm#fnB268"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:6)  <i>Heb</i> "you uprooted cities."<br>
 <a name="fn269" href="psa.htm#fnB269"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:6)  <i>Heb</i> "it has perished, their remembrance, they." The independent pronoun at the end of the line is in apposition to the preceding pronominal suffix and lends emphasis (see <i>IBHS</i> 299). The referent of the masculine pronoun is the nations/enemies (cf. v. 5), not the cities (the Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yru</FONT> ["cities"] is grammatically feminine). This has been specified in the present translation for clarity; many modern translations retain the pronoun "them," resulting in ambiguity (cf. NRSV "their cities you have rooted out; the very memory of them has perished").<br>
 <a name="fn270" href="psa.htm#fnB270"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:7)  The construction <i>vav</i> + subject highlights the contrast between the exalted LORD and his defeated foes (see v. 6).<br>
 <a name="fn271" href="psa.htm#fnB271"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:7)  <i>Heb</i> "sits" (i.e., enthroned, see v. 4). The imperfect verbal form highlights the generalization.<br>

 <a name="fn273" href="psa.htm#fnB273"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:8)  <i>Heb</i> "the peoples." The imperfect verbal forms in v. 8 either describe God's typical, characteristic behavior, or anticipate a future judgment of worldwide proportions ("will judge...").<br>
 <a name="fn274" href="psa.htm#fnB274"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:9)  Following the imperfect in v. 9, the construction <i>vav</i> conjunctive + shortened form of the prefixed verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hyh</FONT> indicates a consequence or result of the preceding statement. The construction functions this same way in Pss 81:15 and 104:20.<br>
 <a name="fn275" href="psa.htm#fnB275"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:9)  <i>Heb</i> "and the LORD is an elevated place for the oppressed." The singular form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">id</FONT> ("oppressed") is collective here.<br>
 <a name="fn276" href="psa.htm#fnB276"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:9)  <i>Heb</i> "[he is] an elevated place for times in trouble." Here an "elevated place" refers to a stronghold, a defensible, secure position that represents a safe haven in times of unrest or distress (cf. NEB "tower of strength"; NIV, NRSV "stronghold").<br>
 <a name="fn277" href="psa.htm#fnB277"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:10)  <i>Heb</i> "and the ones who know your name trust in you." The construction <i>vav</i> conjunctive + imperfect at the beginning of the verse expresses another consequence of the statement made in v. 8. "To know" the LORD's "name" means to recognize his authority and maintain loyalty to him. See Ps 91:14, where "knowing" the LORD's "name" is associated with loving him.<br>
 <a name="fn278" href="psa.htm#fnB278"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:10)  <i>Heb</i> "the ones who seek you."<br>
 <a name="fn279" href="psa.htm#fnB279"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:11)  <i>Heb</i> "sits" (i.e., enthroned, and therefore ruling--see v. 4). Another option is to translate as "lives" or "dwells."<br>
 <a name="fn280" href="psa.htm#fnB280"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:11)  <i>Heb</i> "declare among the nations his deeds."<br>
 <a name="fn281" href="psa.htm#fnB281"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:12)  <i>Heb</i> "for the one who seeks shed blood remembered them." The idiomatic expression "to seek shed blood" seems to carry the idea "to seek payment/restitution for one's shed blood." The plural form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ymd</FONT> ("shed blood") occurs only here as the object of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vrd</FONT>; the singular form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;d</FONT> ("blood") appears with the verb in Gen 9:5; 42:22; Ezek 33:6. "Them," the pronominal object of the verb "remembered," refers to the oppressed, mentioned specifically in the next line, so the referent has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn282" href="psa.htm#fnB282"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:12)  <i>Heb</i> "did not forget."<br>
 <a name="fn283" href="psa.htm#fnB283"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:12)  <i>Heb</i> "the cry for help of the oppressed." In this context the "oppressed" are the psalmist and those he represents, whom the hostile nations have threatened.<br>
 <a name="fn284" href="psa.htm#fnB284"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:13)  The words "when they prayed," though not represented in the Hebrew text, are supplied in the translation for clarification. The petition in vv. 13-14 is best understood as the cry for help which the oppressed offered to God when the nations threatened. The LORD answered this request, prompting the present song of thanksgiving.<br>
 <a name="fn285" href="psa.htm#fnB285"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:13)  Or "show me favor."<br>

 <a name="fn289" href="psa.htm#fnB289"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:14)  <i>Heb</i> "all your praise." "Praise" stands by metonymy for the mighty acts that prompt it (see BDB 240).<br>

 <a name="fn298" href="psa.htm#fnB298"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:17)  <i>Heb</i> "forget." "Forgetting God" refers here to worshiping false gods and thereby refusing to recognize his sovereignty (see also Deut 8:19; Judg 3:7; 1 Sam 12:9; Isa 17:10; Jer 3:21; Ps 44:20). The nations' refusal to acknowledge God's sovereignty accounts for their brazen attempt to attack and destroy his people.<br>
 <a name="fn299" href="psa.htm#fnB299"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:18)  Or "forgotten."<br>
 <a name="fn300" href="psa.htm#fnB300"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:18)  <i>Heb</i> "the hope of the afflicted does [not] perish forever." The negative particle is understood by ellipsis; note the preceding line. The imperfect verbal forms express what typically happens.<br>

Taken in isolation, Psalm 10 is a petition for help in which the psalmist urges the Lord to deliver him from his dangerous enemies, whom he describes in vivid and terrifying detail. The psalmist concludes with confidence; he is certain that God's justice will prevail.<br>
 <a name="fn306" href="psa.htm#fnB306"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:1)  <i>Heb</i> "you hide for times in trouble." The interrogative "why" is understood by ellipsis; note the preceding line. The Hiphil verbal form "hide" has no expressed object. Some supply "your eyes" by ellipsis (see BDB 761 and <i>HALOT</i> 835) or emend the form to a Niphal ("you hide yourself," see <i>BHS</i>, n. c; cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV).<br>

The singular forms <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">uvr</FONT> ("wicked") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ynu</FONT> ("oppressed") are collective and representative, as indicated in the next line, which uses plural verb forms to describe the actions of both.<br>
 <a name="fn308" href="psa.htm#fnB308"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:2)  The two imperfect verbal forms in v. 2 describe either what typically happens (from the psalmist's perspective) or what the psalmist was experiencing at the time he offered this prayer.<br>

The referents of the two pronominal suffixes on the verbs have been specified in the translation for clarity. The referent of the first suffix ("they") is taken as the oppressed, while the referent of the second ("they") is taken to be the wicked (cf. NIV, which renders "wicked" in the previous line as a collective singular). Others take the referent of both occurrences of "they" in the line to be the wicked (cf. NRSV, "let them be caught in the schemes they have devised").<br>
 <a name="fn310" href="psa.htm#fnB310"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:3)  The translation assumes <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk</FONT> is asseverative, "indeed, certainly." Another option is to translate "for," understanding v. 3 as giving the reason why the wicked so arrogantly seek to destroy the helpless (so NASB, NRSV).<br>
 <a name="fn311" href="psa.htm#fnB311"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:3)  The representative or typical evildoer is described in vv. 3-11, 13, 15. Since the singular form predominates in these verses, it has been retained in the translation.<br>
 <a name="fn312" href="psa.htm#fnB312"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:3)  <i>Heb</i> "the wicked [one] boasts on account of the desire of his appetite." The translation assumes that the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu</FONT> introduces the reason why the wicked boasts (cf. this use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu</FONT> with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">llh</FONT> in Ps 119:164 and Ezra 3:11). In this case, the "desire of his appetite" refers by metonymy to the object desired and acquired.<br>
 <a name="fn313" href="psa.htm#fnB313"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:3)  The translation assumes the active participle is substantival, referring to the wicked man mentioned in the preceding line. The substantival participle is then understood as the subject of the following verbs. For other examples of the participle of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">uxb</FONT> used of those who desire and/or acquire wealth through dishonest and/or violent means, see Prov 1:19; 15:27; Jer 6:13; 8:10; Hab 2:9.<br>
 <a name="fn314" href="psa.htm#fnB314"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:3)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">irb</FONT> normally means "to bless," but in a few cases it exhibits the polarized meaning "to curse" (1 Kgs 21:10, 13; Job 1:5-11; 2:5-9). (Some regard this use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">irb</FONT> as a mere euphemism.) The verb refers to the act of pronouncing or calling down a formal curse upon the object of one's anger.<br>
 <a name="fn315" href="psa.htm#fnB315"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:3)  The conjunction "and" is supplied in the translation; it does not appear in the Hebrew text.<br>
 <a name="fn316" href="psa.htm#fnB316"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:3)  Another option is to translate, "he blesses one who robs others, [but] he curses the LORD." In this case the subject of the verbs is "the wicked man" mentioned in the previous line, and "the one who robs others" is the object of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">irb</FONT>, which is understood in its usual sense of "bless."<br>
 <a name="fn317" href="psa.htm#fnB317"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:4)  <i>Heb</i> "the wicked [one], according to the height of his nose, he does not seek, there is no God, all his thoughts." The phrase "height of his nose" probably refers to an arrogant or snooty attitude; it likely pictures one with his nose turned upward toward the sky in pride (see <i>HALOT</i> 171). One could take the "wicked" as the subject of the negated verb "seek," in which case the point is that the wicked do not "seek" God. The translation assumes that this statement, along with "there is no God," is what the wicked man thinks to himself. In this case God is the subject of the verb "seek," and the point is that God will not hold the wicked man accountable for his actions. Verse 13 strongly favors this interpretation. The statement "there is no God" is not a philosophical assertion that God does not exist, but rather a confident affirmation that he is unconcerned about how men live morally and ethically (see v. 11).<br>
 <a name="fn318" href="psa.htm#fnB318"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:5)  <i>Heb</i> "they are firm, his ways, at every time." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lyj</FONT> ("be firm, be strong") occurs only here and in Job 20:21, where it has the sense "endure" (see BDB 298).<br>
 <a name="fn319" href="psa.htm#fnB319"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tc</b> (10:5)  <i>Heb</i> "[on a] height, your judgments from before him." If the MT is retained, then the idea may be that God's "judgments" are high above (i.e., not recognized) by the wicked man. However, the syntax is awkward. The translation assumes an emendation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;wrm</FONT> ("height") to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wrs*</FONT> ("[your judgments] are turned aside") the final <i>mem</i> being dittographic (note the initial <i>mem</i> on the immediately following <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">iyfpvm</FONT>, ["your judgments"). "Judgments" probably refers here to God's laws or commands, rather than his judicial decisions or acts of judgment.<br>
 <a name="fn320" href="psa.htm#fnB320"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:5)  <i>Heb</i> "all his enemies, he snorts against them." This may picture the wicked man defiantly challenging his enemies because he is confident of success. Another option is to take <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jypy</FONT> from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jpy</FONT> ("to testify") and translate "he testifies against all his enemies," implying that he gets the upper hand over them in legal battles. The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">j^p@y&#180;</FONT> ("witness") is attested in biblical Hebrew (see Prov 6:19; 12:17; 14:5, 25; 19:5, 9, and Hab 2:3). The verb, however, is not clearly attested.<br>
 <a name="fn321" href="psa.htm#fnB321"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:6)  <i>Heb</i> "he says in his heart/mind."<br>
 <a name="fn322" href="psa.htm#fnB322"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:6)  <i>Heb</i> "for a generation and a generation." The traditional accentuation of the MT understands these words with the following line.<br>
 <a name="fn323" href="psa.htm#fnB323"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:6)  <i>Heb</i> "who, not in calamity." If <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> is taken as a relative pronoun here, then one could translate, "[I] who [am] not in calamity." Some emend <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rv#ao</FONT>, "happiness" (see <i>HALOT</i> 99); one might then translate, "[I live in] happiness, not in calamity." The present translation assumes that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> functions here as a causal conjunction, "because, for." For this use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT>, see BDB 83 (where the present text is not cited).<br>
 <a name="fn324" href="psa.htm#fnB324"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:7)  <i>Heb</i> "[with] a curse his mouth is full, and lies and injury."<br>

This verse presents several lexical and syntactical difficulties. The first word<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkdy</FONT>) is an otherwise unattested Qal form of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkd</FONT> ("crush"). (The Qere [marginal] form is imperfect; the consonantal text [Kethib] has the perfect with a prefixed conjunction <i>vav</i>.) If the wicked man's victim is the subject, which seems to be the case (note the two verbs which follow), then the form should be emended to a Niphal (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hk#D&#180;y]</FONT>). The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wymwxub</FONT> ("into his strong [ones]"), poses interpretive problems. The preposition -<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B=</FONT> follows the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lpn</FONT> ("fall"), so it may very well carry the nuance "into" here, with "his strong [ones]" then referring to something into which the oppressed individual falls. Since a net is mentioned in the preceding verse as the instrument used to entrap the victim, it is possible that "strong [ones]" here refers metonymically to the wicked man's nets or traps. Ps 35:8 refers to a man falling into a net (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tvr</FONT>), as does Ps 141:10 (where the plural of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rmkm</FONT>, "net," is used). A hunter's net (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tvr</FONT>), is associated with snares (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jp</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yvqwm</FONT>) and ropes (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ylbj</FONT>) in Ps 140:5. The final word in the verse (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yaklj</FONT>, "unfortunate [ones]," may be an alternate form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jlkj</FONT>, "unfortunate [one]" (see vv. 8, 14). The Qere (marginal reading) divides the form into two words, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yak lj</FONT>, "army/host of disheartened [ones]." The three verb forms in v. 10 are singular because the representative "oppressed" individual is the grammatical subject (see the singular <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ynu</FONT> in v. 9).<br>
 <a name="fn333" href="psa.htm#fnB333"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:11)  <i>Heb</i> "he says in his heart." See v. 6.<br>

 <a name="fn336" href="psa.htm#fnB336"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:12)  <i>Heb</i> "lift up your hand." Usually the expression "lifting the hand" refers to praying (Pss 28:2; 134:2) or making an oath (Ps 106:26), but here it probably refers to "striking a blow" (see 2 Sam 18:28; 20:21). Note v. 15, where the psalmist asks the LORD to "break the arm of the wicked." A less likely option is that the psalmist is requesting that the LORD declare by oath his intention to intervene.<br>
 <a name="fn337" href="psa.htm#fnB337"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:13)  The rhetorical question expresses the psalmist's outrage that the wicked would have the audacity to disdain God.<br>

The syntax is awkward and the meaning unclear. It is uncertain who or what is being given into God's hand. Elsewhere the idiom "give into the hand" means to deliver into one's possession. If "to give" goes with what precedes (as the accentuation of the Hebrew text suggests), then this may refer to the wicked man being delivered over to God for judgment. The present translation assumes that "to give" goes with what follows (cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV). The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bzuy</FONT> here has the nuance "entrust" (see Gen 39:6; Job 39:11); the direct object ("[his] cause") is implied (see BDB 737).<br>
 <a name="fn346" href="psa.htm#fnB346"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:14)  Or "help."<br>

 <b>sn</b> (10:14)  <i>The fatherless</i>. Because they were so vulnerable and were frequently exploited, fatherless children are often mentioned as epitomizing the oppressed (see Pss 68:5; 82:3; 94:6; 146:9; as well as Job 6:27; 22:9; 24:3, 9; 29:12; 31:17, 21).<br>
 <a name="fn348" href="psa.htm#fnB348"><sup>43</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:15)  The <i>arm</i> symbolizes the strength of the wicked, which they use to oppress and exploit the weak.<br>

As in v. 13, the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vrd</FONT> ("seek") is used here in the sense of "seek an accounting." One could understand the imperfect as describing a fact, "you hold him accountable," or as anticipating divine judgment, "you will hold him accountable." However, since the verb is in apparent parallelism with the preceding imperative ("break"), it is better to understand the imperfect as expressing the psalmist's desire or request.<br>
 <a name="fn350" href="psa.htm#fnB350"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:15)  <i>Heb</i> "you will not find." It is uncertain how this statement relates to what precedes. Some take <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lb</FONT>, which is used as a negative particle in vv. 4, 6, 11, 18, as asseverative here, "Indeed find (i.e., judge his wickedness)." The translation assumes that the final words are an asyndetic relative clause which refers back to what the wicked man boasted in God's face ("you will not find [i.e., my wickedness]"). See v. 13.<br>
 <a name="fn351" href="psa.htm#fnB351"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:16)  <i>Heb</i> "the LORD is king forever and ever."<br>
 <a name="fn352" href="psa.htm#fnB352"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:16)  Or "the nations perish from his land." The perfect verb form may express what is typical or it may express rhetorically the psalmist's certitude that God's deliverance is "as good as done."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (10:16)  <i>The nations</i> may be the underlying reality behind the psalmist's references to the "wicked" in the earlier verses. This reference to the nations may have motivated the combining of Ps 10 with Ps 9 (see Ps 9:5, 15, 19).<br>
 <a name="fn353" href="psa.htm#fnB353"><sup>48</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:17)  <i>You have heard</i>. The psalmist is confident that God has responded positively to his earlier petitions for divine intervention. The psalmist apparently prayed the words of vv. 16-18 after the reception of an oracle of deliverance (given in response to the confident petition of vv. 12-15) or after the Lord actually delivered him from his enemies.<br>
 <a name="fn354" href="psa.htm#fnB354"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:17)  <i>Heb</i> "desire."<br>

The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vwna</FONT> ("man") refers here to the wicked nations (v. 16).

 <a name="fn359" href="psa.htm#fnB359"><sup>54</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:18)  <i>Psalm 11</i>. The psalmist rejects the advice to flee from his dangerous enemies. Instead he affirms his confidence in God's just character and calls down judgment on evildoers.<br>

The Kethib (consonantal text) reads: "flee [masculine plural!] to your [masculine plural!] mountain, bird." The Qere (marginal reading) has "flee" in a feminine singular form, agreeing grammatically with the addressee, the feminine noun "bird." Rather than being a second masculine plural pronominal suffix, the ending <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;k</FONT>- attached to "mountain" is better interpreted as a second feminine singular pronominal suffix followed by an enclitic <i>mem</i>. "Bird" may be taken as vocative ("O bird") or as an adverbial accusative of manner ("like a bird"). Either way, the psalmist's advisers compare him to a helpless bird whose only option in the face of danger is to fly away to an inaccessible place.<br>
 <a name="fn363" href="psa.htm#fnB363"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:2)  In the psalms the "wicked" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yuvr</FONT>) are typically proud, practical atheists (Ps 10:2, 4, 11) who hate God's commands, commit sinful deeds, speak lies and slander (Ps 50:16-20), and cheat others (Ps. 37:21). They oppose God and threaten his people (Ps 3:8).<br>

In this way the psalmist seeks to activate divine judgment by appealing to God's just character. For an example of the power of such a curse, see Judg 9:7-57.<br>

The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yj!P^</FONT> ("traps, snares") should be emended to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ym@j&amp;P^</FONT> ("coals of [fire]"). The rare noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;j*P</FONT> ("coal") occurs in Prov 26:21 and Isa 44:12; 54:16.<br>
 <a name="fn385" href="psa.htm#fnB385"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (11:6)  The image of God "raining down" <i>brimstone</i> on the objects of his judgment also appears in Gen 19:24 and Ezek 38:22.<br>
 <a name="fn386" href="psa.htm#fnB386"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:6)  <i>Heb</i> "[may] a wind of rage [be] the portion of their cup." The precise meaning of the rare noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twpulz</FONT> is uncertain. It may mean "raging heat" (BDB 273) or simply "rage" (<i>HALOT</i> 272). If one understands the former sense, then one might translate "hot wind" (cf. NEB, NRSV). The present translation assumes the latter nuance, "a wind of rage" (the genitive is attributive) referring to a "whirlwind" symbolic of destructive judgment. In this mixed metaphor, judgment is also compared to an allotted portion of a beverage poured into one's drinking cup (see Hab 2:15-16).<br>

The Lord "loves" such deeds in the sense that he rewards them. Another option is to take <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twqdx</FONT> as referring to God's acts of justice (see Ps 103:6). In this case one could translate, "he loves to do just deeds."<br>
 <a name="fn390" href="psa.htm#fnB390"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:7)  <i>Heb</i> "the upright will see his face." The singular subject ("upright") does not agree with the plural verb. However, collective singular nouns can be construed with a plural predicate (see GKC &#167;145.<i>b</i>). Another possibility is that the plural verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wzjy</FONT> is a corruption of an original singular form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hzjy</FONT>. To "see" God's "face" means to have access to his presence and to experience his favor (see Ps 17:15 and Job 33:26 [where <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">har</FONT>, not <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hzj</FONT>, is used]). On the form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wmynp</FONT>, "his face," see GKC &#167;103.<i>b</i> n. 3.<br>
 <a name="fn391" href="psa.htm#fnB391"><sup>32</sup></a><b>sn</b> (11:7)  <i>Psalm 12</i>. The psalmist asks the Lord to intervene, for society is overrun by deceitful, arrogant oppressors and godly individuals are a dying breed. When the Lord announces his intention to defend the oppressed, the psalmist affirms his confidence in the divine promise.<br>

 <a name="fn393" href="psa.htm#fnB393"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:1)  The singular form is collective or representative. Note the plural form "faithful [ones]" in the following line. A "godly [one]" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dysj</FONT>) is one who does what is right in God's eyes and remains faithful to God (see Pss 4:3; 18:25; 31:23; 37:28; 86:2; 97:10).<br>

 <a name="fn398" href="psa.htm#fnB398"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:2)  <i>Heb</i> "[with] a lip of smoothness, with a heart and a heart they speak." Speaking a "smooth" word refers to deceptive flattery (cf. Ps 5:9; 55:21; Prov 2:16; 5:3; 7:5, 21; 26:28; 28:23; Isa 30:10). "Heart" here refers to their mind, from which their motives and intentions originate. The repetition of the noun indicates diversity (see GKC &#167;123.<i>f</i>, <i>IBHS</i> 116, and Deut 25:13, where the phrase "weight and a weight" refers to two different measuring weights). These people have two different types of "hearts." Their flattering words seem to express kind motives and intentions, but this outward display does not really reflect their true motives. Their real "heart" is filled with evil thoughts and destructive intentions. The "heart" that is seemingly displayed through their words is far different from the real "heart" they keep disguised. (For the idea see Ps 28:3.) In 1 Chr 12:33 the phrase "without a heart and a heart" means "undivided loyalty."<br>
 <a name="fn399" href="psa.htm#fnB399"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:3)  The verb form is a jussive, indicating that the statement is imprecatory ("May the LORD cut off"), not indicative ("The LORD will cut off"; see also Ps 109:15 and Mal 2:12). The psalmist appeals to God to destroy the wicked, rather than simply stating his confidence that he will. In this way he seeks to activate divine judgment by appealing to God's just character. For an example of the power of such a curse, see Judg 9:7-57.<br>
 <a name="fn400" href="psa.htm#fnB400"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:3)  <i>Heb</i> "a tongue speaking great [things]."<br>
 <a name="fn401" href="psa.htm#fnB401"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:4)  <i>Heb</i> "which say." The plural verb after the relative pronoun indicates a plural antecedent for the pronoun, probably "lips" in v. 3.<br>
 <a name="fn402" href="psa.htm#fnB402"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:4)  <i>Heb</i> "to our tongue we make strong." The Hiphil of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rbg</FONT>, occurs only here and in Dan 9:27, where it refers to making strong, or confirming, a covenant. Here in Ps 12 the evildoers "make their tongue strong" in the sense that they use their tongue to produce flattering and arrogant words to accomplish their purposes. The preposition -<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l=</FONT> prefixed to "our tongue" may be dittographic.<br>
 <a name="fn403" href="psa.htm#fnB403"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:4)  <i>Heb</i> "our lips [are] with us." This odd expression probably means, "our lips are in our power," in the sense that they say what they want, whether it be flattery or boasting. For other cases where <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta</FONT> ("with") has the sense "in the power of," see Ps 38:10 and other texts listed by BDB 86 (3.a).<br>
 <a name="fn404" href="psa.htm#fnB404"><sup>12</sup></a><b>sn</b> (12:4)  The rhetorical question expresses the arrogant attitude of these people. As far as they are concerned, they are answerable to no one for how they speak.<br>
 <a name="fn405" href="psa.htm#fnB405"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:5)  The term translated "oppressed" is an objective genitive; the oppressed are the recipients/victims of violence.<br>
 <a name="fn406" href="psa.htm#fnB406"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:5)  Elsewhere in the psalms this noun is used of the painful groans of prisoners awaiting death (79:11; 102:20). The related verb is used of the painful groaning of those wounded in combat (Jer 51:52; Ezek 26:15) and of the mournful sighing of those in grief (Ezek 9:4; 24:17).<br>
 <a name="fn407" href="psa.htm#fnB407"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:5)  <i>Heb</i> "I will rise up."<br>
 <a name="fn408" href="psa.htm#fnB408"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:5)  <i>Heb</i> "I will place in deliverance, he pants for it." The final two words in Hebrew (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wl jypy</FONT>) comprise an asyndetic relative clause, "the one who pants for it." "The one who pants" is the object of the verb "place" and the antecedent of the pronominal suffix (in the phrase "for it") is "deliverance." Another option is to translate, "I will place in deliverance the witness for him," repointing <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">j^yp!y&#180;</FONT> (a Hiphil imperfect from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jwp</FONT>, "pant") as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">j^p@y&#180;</FONT>, a noun meaning "witness." In this case the LORD would be promising protection to those who have the courage to support the oppressed in the court of law. However, the first part of the verse focuses on the oppressed, not their advocates.<br>
 <a name="fn409" href="psa.htm#fnB409"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:6)  <i>Heb</i> "the words of the LORD are pure words," i.e., untainted by falsehood or deception (in contrast to the flattery of the evildoers, v. 2).<br>

The singular participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qqzm</FONT> ("refined") modifies "silver." The number seven is used rhetorically to express the thorough nature of the action. For other rhetorical/figurative uses of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ytubv</FONT> ("seven times"), see Gen 4:15, 24; Ps 79:12; Prov 6:31; Isa 30:26.<br>
 <a name="fn411" href="psa.htm#fnB411"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:7)  The third person plural pronominal suffix on the verb is masculine, referring back to the "oppressed" and "needy" in v. 5 (both of those nouns are plural in form), suggesting that the verb means "protect" here. The suffix does not refer to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twrma</FONT> ("words") in v. 6, because that term is feminine gender.<br>
 <a name="fn412" href="psa.htm#fnB412"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:7)  <i>Heb</i> "you will protect him from this generation permanently." The third masculine singular suffix on the verb "protect" is probably used in a distributive sense, referring to each one within the group mentioned previously (the oppressed/needy, referred to as "them" in the preceding line). On this grammatical point see GKC &#167;123.<i>f</i> (where the present text is not cited). (Some Hebrew MSS and ancient textual witnesses read "us," both here and in the preceding line.) The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rwd</FONT> ("generation") refers here to the psalmist's contemporaries, who were characterized by deceit and arrogance (see vv. 1-2). See BDB 190 for other examples where "generation" refers to a class of people.<br>
 <a name="fn413" href="psa.htm#fnB413"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:8)  <i>Heb</i> "the wicked walk all around." One could translate v. 8a as an independent clause, in which case it would be a concluding observation in proverbial style. The present translation assumes that v. 8a is a subordinate explanatory clause, or perhaps a subordinate temporal clause ("while the wicked walk all around"). The adverb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bybs</FONT> ("around"), in combination with the Hitpael form of the verb "walk" (which indicates repeated action), pictures the wicked as ubiquitous. They have seemingly overrun society.<br>
 <a name="fn414" href="psa.htm#fnB414"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:8)  <i>Heb</i> "when evil is lifted up by the sons of man." The abstract noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twlz</FONT> ("evil") occurs only here. On the basis of evidence from the cognate languages (see <i>HALOT</i> 272), one might propose the meaning "base character," or "morally foolish behavior."<br>
 <a name="fn415" href="psa.htm#fnB415"><sup>23</sup></a><b>sn</b> (12:8)  <i>Psalm 13</i>. The psalmist, who is close to death, desperately pleads for God's deliverance and affirms his trust in God's faithfulness.<br>

 <a name="fn420" href="psa.htm#fnB420"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:2)  <i>Heb</i> "be exalted over me." Perhaps one could translate, "How long will my enemy defeat me?"<br>

 <a name="fn422" href="psa.htm#fnB422"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:3)  <i>Heb</i> "Give light [to] my eyes." The Hiphil of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rwa</FONT>, when used elsewhere with "eyes" as object, refers to the law of God giving moral enlightenment (Ps 19:9), to God the creator giving literal eyesight to all people (Prov 29:13), and to God giving encouragement to his people (Ezra 9:8). Here the psalmist pictures himself as being on the verge of death. His eyes are falling shut and, if God does not intervene soon, he will "fall asleep" for good.<br>
 <a name="fn423" href="psa.htm#fnB423"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:3)  <i>Heb</i> "or else I will sleep [in?] the death." Perhaps the statement is elliptical, "I will sleep [the sleep] of death," or "I will sleep [with the sleepers in] death."<br>

 <a name="fn426" href="psa.htm#fnB426"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:5)  The grammatical construction used here (conjunction with independent pronoun) highlights the contrast between the psalmist's defeated condition envisioned in v. 4 and confident attitude he displays in v. 5.<br>
 <a name="fn427" href="psa.htm#fnB427"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:5)  <i>Heb</i> "may my heart rejoice in your deliverance." The verb form is jussive. Having expressed his trust in God's faithful character and promises, the psalmist prays that his confidence will prove to be well-placed. "Heart" is used here of the seat of the emotions.<br>
 <a name="fn428" href="psa.htm#fnB428"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:5)  The verb form is cohortative, indicating the psalmist's resolve (or vow) to praise the LORD when deliverance arrives.<br>
 <a name="fn429" href="psa.htm#fnB429"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:5)  Or "for he will have vindicated me." The verb form indicates a future perfect here. The idiom <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu lmg</FONT> means "to repay," here in a positive sense (see BDB 168).<br>
 <a name="fn430" href="psa.htm#fnB430"><sup>15</sup></a><b>sn</b> (13:5)  <i>Psalm 14</i>. The psalmist observes that the human race is morally corrupt. Evildoers oppress God's people, but the psalmist is confident of God's protection and anticipates a day when God will vindicate Israel.<br>
 <a name="fn431" href="psa.htm#fnB431"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:1)  <i>Heb</i> "a fool says in his heart." The singular is used here in a collective or representative sense; the typical fool is envisioned.<br>
 <a name="fn432" href="psa.htm#fnB432"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (14:1)  <i>"There is no God."</i> The statement is probably not a philosophical assertion that God does not exist, but rather a confident affirmation that God is unconcerned about how men live morally and ethically (see Ps 10:4, 11).<br>
 <a name="fn433" href="psa.htm#fnB433"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:1)  <i>Heb</i> "they act corruptly, they make a deed evil." The verbs describe the typical behavior of the wicked. The subject of the plural verbs is "sons of man" (v. 2). The entire human race is characterized by sinful behavior. This practical atheism--living as if there is no God who will hold them accountable for their actions--makes them fools, for one of the earmarks of folly is to fail to anticipate the long range consequences of one's behavior.<br>
 <a name="fn434" href="psa.htm#fnB434"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:1)  <i>Heb</i> "there is none that does good."<br>

 <a name="fn443" href="psa.htm#fnB443"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:4)  <i>Heb</i> "Do they not understand?" The rhetorical question (rendered in the translation as a positive affirmation) expresses the psalmist's amazement at their apparent lack of understanding. This may refer to their lack of moral understanding, but it more likely refers to their failure to anticipate God's defense of his people (see vv. 5-7).<br>
 <a name="fn444" href="psa.htm#fnB444"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:5)  <i>Heb</i> "there they are afraid [with] fear." The perfect verbal form is probably used in a rhetorical manner; the psalmist describes the future demise of the oppressors as if it were already occurring. The adverb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v</FONT> ("there") is also used here for dramatic effect, as the psalmist envisions the wicked standing in fear at a spot that is this vivid in his imagination (see BDB 1027). The cognate accusative following the verb emphasizes the degree of their terror.<br>
 <a name="fn445" href="psa.htm#fnB445"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:5)  <i>Heb</i> "for God is with a godly generation." The Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rwd</FONT> ("generation") refers here to the general class of people who are characterized by godliness. See BDB 190 for other examples where "generation" refers to a class of people.<br>
 <a name="fn446" href="psa.htm#fnB446"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:6)  <i>Heb</i> "the counsel of the oppressed you put to shame." Using a second person plural verb form, the psalmist addresses the wicked. Since the context indicates their attempt to harm the godly will be thwarted, the imperfect should be taken in a subjunctive (cf. NASB, NRSV) rather than an indicative manner (cf. NIV). Here it probably expresses their desire or intent ("want to humiliate").<br>
 <a name="fn447" href="psa.htm#fnB447"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:6)  It is unlikely that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk</FONT> has a causal force here. The translation assumes a concessive force; another option is to understand an asseverative use ("certainly, indeed").<br>
 <a name="fn448" href="psa.htm#fnB448"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:6)  <i>Heb</i> "his." The antecedent of the singular pronoun is the singular form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ynu</FONT> ("oppressed") in the preceding line.

 <a name="fn449" href="psa.htm#fnB449"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (14:7)  <i>The deliverance of Israel</i>. This refers metonymically to God, the one who lives in Zion and provides deliverance for Israel.<br>

 <a name="fn455" href="psa.htm#fnB455"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:1)  In this context the Lord's <i>holy hill</i> probably refers to Zion/Jerusalem. See Isa 66:20; Joel 2:1; 3:17; Zech 8:3; Pss 2:6; 43:3; 48:1; 87:1; Dan 9:16.<br>

 <a name="fn458" href="psa.htm#fnB458"><sup>5</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:3)  Hebrew literature often assumes and reflects the male-oriented perspective of ancient Israelite society. The principle of the psalm is certainly applicable to all people, regardless of their gender or age.<br>

The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">samn</FONT> ("rejected [one]") apparently refers here to one who has been rejected by God because of his godless behavior.

 <a name="fn463" href="psa.htm#fnB463"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:4)  <i>Heb</i> "those who fear the LORD." The one who fears the LORD respects his sovereignty and obeys his commandments. See Ps 128:1; Prov 14:2.<br>

The phrase "to do harm" cannot mean "do harm to others," for the preceding verse clearly characterizes this individual as one who does <i>not</i> harm others. In this context the phrase must refer to an oath to which a self-imprecation is attached. The godly individual takes his commitments to others so seriously he is willing to "swear to his own hurt." For an example of such an oath, see Ruth 1:16-17.<br>

 <a name="fn470" href="psa.htm#fnB470"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:1)  The Hebrew perfect verbal form probably refers here to a completed action with continuing results (see 7:1; 11:1).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (16:1)  <i>Taken shelter</i>. "Taking shelter" in the Lord is an idiom for seeking his protection. Seeking his protection presupposes and even demonstrates the subject's loyalty to the Lord. In the psalms those who "take shelter" in the Lord are contrasted with the wicked and equated with those who love, fear and serve the Lord (Pss 5:11-12; 31:17-20; 34:21-22).<br>
 <a name="fn471" href="psa.htm#fnB471"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:2)  <i>Heb</i> "my good [is] not beyond you." For the use of the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu</FONT> in the sense of "beyond," see BDB 755.<br>

The difficult syntax makes the meaning of the verse uncertain. The phrase "holy ones" sometimes refers to God's angelic assembly (see Ps 89:5, 7), but the qualifying clause "who are in the land" suggests that here it refers to God's people (Ps 34:9) or to their priestly leaders (2 Chr 35:3).<br>
 <a name="fn473" href="psa.htm#fnB473"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:4)  <i>Heb</i> "their troubles multiply, another, they pay a dowry." The meaning of the text is unclear. The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twbxu</FONT> ("troubles") appears to be a plural form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tbxu</FONT> ("pain, wound"; see Job 9:28; Ps 147:3). Because idolatry appears to be in view (see v. 4b), some prefer to emend the noun to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ybxu</FONT> ("idols"). "Troubles" may be a wordplay on "idols" or a later alteration designed to emphasize that idolatry leads to trouble. The singular form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rja</FONT> ("another") is syntactically problematic here. Perhaps the form should be emended to a plural <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrja</FONT> ("others"). (The final <i>mem</i> could have been lost by haplography; note the <i>mem</i> at the beginning of the next word.) In this case it might be taken as an abbreviated form of the well-attested phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrja &lt;yhla</FONT> ("other gods"). (In Isa 42:8 the singular form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rja</FONT>, "another," is used of another god.) The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rrhm</FONT> appears in the Qal stem; the only other use of a Qal verbal form of a root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rhm</FONT> is in Exod 22:15, where the denominative verb<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> rhm</FONT> ("purchase [a wife]"; cf. the related noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rh^m)</FONT>, "bride-money, purchase price for a wife") appears. If that verb is understood here, then the idolaters are pictured as eager bridegrooms paying the price to acquire the object of their desire. Another option is to emend the verb to a Piel and translate, "hurry (after)."<br>
 <a name="fn474" href="psa.htm#fnB474"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:4)  <i>Heb</i> "I will not pour out their drink offerings of blood." The third masculine plural suffix would appear to refer back to the people/leaders mentioned in v. 3. However, if we emend <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rja</FONT> ("another") to the plural <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrja</FONT> ("other [gods]") in v. 4, the suffix can be understood as referring to these gods--"the drink offerings [made to] them." The next line favors this interpretation. Perhaps this refers to some type of pagan cultic ritual. Elsewhere wine is the prescribed content of drink offerings (see <i>HALOT</i> 703).<br>
 <a name="fn475" href="psa.htm#fnB475"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:4)  <i>Heb</i> "and I will not lift up their names upon my lips." The expression "lift up the name" probably refers here to swearing an oath in the name of deity (see Exod 20:7; Deut 5:11). If so, the third masculine plural suffix on "names" likely refers to the pagan gods, not the people/leaders. See the preceding note.<br>
 <a name="fn476" href="psa.htm#fnB476"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:5)  <i>Heb</i> "O LORD, the portion of my possession and my cup"; or "the LORD [is] the portion of my possession and my cup." The psalmist compares the LORD to landed property, which was foundational to economic stability in ancient Israel, and to a cup of wine, which may symbolize a reward (in Ps 11:6 it symbolizes the judgment one deserves) or divine blessing (see Ps 23:5). The metaphor highlights the fact that God is the psalmist's source of security and prosperity.<br>
 <a name="fn477" href="psa.htm#fnB477"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tc</b> (16:5)  <i>Heb</i> "you take hold of my lot." The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">iym!wt</FONT> should be emended to a participle, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">im@wt</FONT>. The psalmist pictures the LORD as casting his lot (a method used to allot landed property) for him, thus assuring that he will receive a fertile piece of land (see v. 6). See BDB 1069. As in the previous line, land represents security and economic stability, thus "you make my future secure."<br>
 <a name="fn478" href="psa.htm#fnB478"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:6)  <i>Heb</i> "measuring lines have fallen for me in pleasant [places]; yes, property [or, "an inheritance"] is beautiful for me." On the dative use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu</FONT>, see BDB 758 (II.8). Extending the metaphor used in v. 5, the psalmist compares the divine blessings he has received to a rich, beautiful tract of land that one might receive by allotment or inheritance.<br>
 <a name="fn479" href="psa.htm#fnB479"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:7)  <i>Heb</i> "bless," that is, "proclaim as worthy of praise."<br>

 <a name="fn482" href="psa.htm#fnB482"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:7)  <i>Heb</i> "yes, [during] nights my kidneys instruct [or, "correct"] me." The "kidneys" are viewed here as the seat of the psalmist's moral character (see Ps 26:2). In the quiet darkness the LORD speaks to his inner being, as it were, and enables him to grow in moral understanding.<br>
 <a name="fn483" href="psa.htm#fnB483"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:8)  <i>Heb</i> "I set the LORD before me continually." This may mean that the psalmist is aware of the LORD's presence and sensitive to his moral guidance (see v. 7), or that he trusts in the LORD's protection (see the following line).<br>
 <a name="fn484" href="psa.htm#fnB484"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:9)  <i>Heb</i> "my glory is happy." Some view the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ydwbk</FONT> ("my glory") as a metonymy for man's inner being (see BDB 459), but it is preferable to emend the form to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yd]b@K=</FONT> ("my liver"; see <i>HALOT</i> 456). Like the heart, the liver is viewed as the seat of one's emotions. See also Pss 30:12; 57:9; 108:1, as well as H. W. Wolff, <i>Anthropology of the Old Testament</i>, 64, and M. Dahood, <i>Psalms</i>, 1:90. For an Ugaritic example of the heart/liver as the source of joy, see J. C. L. Gibson, <i>Canaanite Myths and Legends</i>, 47-48: "her [Anat's] liver swelled with laughter, her heart was filled with joy, the liver of Anat with triumph."<br>
 <a name="fn485" href="psa.htm#fnB485"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:9)  <i>Heb</i> "yes, my flesh dwells securely." The psalmist's "flesh" stands by metonymy for his body and, by extension, his physical life.<br>
 <a name="fn486" href="psa.htm#fnB486"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:10)  Or "my life." The suffixed form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vpn</FONT>, "being," is often equivalent to a pronoun in poetic texts.<br>

 <a name="fn488" href="psa.htm#fnB488"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:10)  A "faithful follower" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dysj</FONT>, traditionally rendered "holy one") is one who does what is right in God's eyes and remains faithful to God (see Pss 4:3; 12:1; 18:25; 31:23; 37:28; 86:2; 97:10). The psalmist here refers to himself, as the parallel line ("You will not abandon me to Sheol") indicates.<br>
 <a name="fn489" href="psa.htm#fnB489"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:10)  That is, "experience." The psalmist is confident that the Lord will protect him in his present crisis (see v. 1) and prevent him from dying.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (16:10)  According to Peter, the words of Ps 16:8-11 are applicable to Jesus (Acts 2:25-29). Peter goes on to argue that David, being a prophet, foresaw future events and spoke of Jesus' resurrection from the dead (Acts 2:30-33). Paul seems to concur with Peter in this understanding (see Acts 13:35-37). For a discussion of the NT application of these verses to Jesus' resurrection, see R. B. Chisholm, Jr., "A Theology of the Psalms," in <i>A Biblical Theology of the Old Testament</i>, ed. R. B. Zuck, 292-95.<br>
 <a name="fn490" href="psa.htm#fnB490"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:10)  The Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tjv</FONT> ("pit") is often used as a title for Sheol (see Pss 30:9; 49:9; 55:24; 103:4). Note the parallelism with the previous line.<br>
 <a name="fn491" href="psa.htm#fnB491"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:11)  <i>Heb</i> "cause me to know"; or, "cause me to experience."<br>
 <a name="fn492" href="psa.htm#fnB492"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:11)  This is a metaphorical way of saying, "you preserve my life." The phrase "path of life" stands in contrast to death/Sheol in Prov 2:18-19; 5:5-6; 15:24.<br>
 <a name="fn493" href="psa.htm#fnB493"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:11)  <i>Heb</i> "abundance of joy [is] with your face." The plural form of the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hjmc</FONT> ("joy") occurs only here and in Ps 45:15. It may emphasize the degree of joy experienced.<br>
 <a name="fn494" href="psa.htm#fnB494"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:11)  <i>Heb</i> "delight [is] in your right hand forever."

 <a name="fn495" href="psa.htm#fnB495"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (16:11)  <i>Psalm 17</i>. The psalmist asks God to intervene on his behalf because his life is threatened by dangerous enemies. He appeals to divine justice, for he is certain of his own innocence. Because he is innocent, he expects to encounter God and receive an assuring word.<br>
 <a name="fn496" href="psa.htm#fnB496"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:1)  <i>Heb</i> "hear, LORD, what is just."<br>

 <a name="fn498" href="psa.htm#fnB498"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:2)  <i>Heb</i> "From before you may my justice come out." The prefixed verbal form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">axy</FONT> could be taken as an imperfect, but following the imperatives in v. 1, it is better understood as a jussive of prayer.<br>
 <a name="fn499" href="psa.htm#fnB499"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:2)  <i>Heb</i> "May your eyes look at what is right." The prefixed verbal form is understood as jussive. (See also the preceding note on the word "behalf.")<br>

 <a name="fn502" href="psa.htm#fnB502"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tc</b> (17:3)  <i>Heb</i> "you tested me, you do not find, I plan, my mouth will not cross over." The Hebrew verbal form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ytmz</FONT> is a Qal perfect, first person singular from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;mz</FONT> ("plan, plan evil"). Some emend the form to a suffixed form of the noun, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yt!M*z]</FONT> ("my plan/evil plan"), and take it as the object of the preceding verb "find." However, the suffix seems odd, since the psalmist is denying that he has any wrong thoughts. If one takes the form with what precedes, it might make better sense to read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toMz]</FONT> ("evil plans"). However, this emendation leaves an unclear connection with the next line. The present translation maintains the verbal form found in the MT and understands it in a neutral sense, "I have decided" (see Jer 4:28). The words "my mouth will not cross over" (i.e., "transgress, sin") can then be taken as a noun clause functioning as the object of the verb.<br>
 <a name="fn503" href="psa.htm#fnB503"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:4)  <i>Heb</i> "with regard to the deeds of man[kind]."<br>

 <a name="fn505" href="psa.htm#fnB505"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:5)  <i>Heb</i> "my steps stay firm in your tracks." The infinitive absolute functions here as a finite verb (see GKC &#167;113.<i>gg</i>). God's "tracks" are his commands, i.e., the moral pathways he has prescribed for the psalmist.<br>
 <a name="fn506" href="psa.htm#fnB506"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:5)  <i>Heb</i> "my footsteps do not stagger."<br>

 <b>sn</b> (17:7)  <i>Those who look to you for protection from their enemies</i>. "Seeking shelter" in the Lord is an idiom for seeking his protection. Seeking his protection presupposes and even demonstrates the subject's loyalty to the Lord. In the psalms those who "take shelter" in the Lord are contrasted with the wicked and equated with those who love, fear and serve the Lord (Pss 5:11-12; 31:17-20; 34:21-22).<br>

 <a name="fn514" href="psa.htm#fnB514"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:9)  <i>Heb</i> "destroy." The psalmist uses the perfect verbal form to emphasize the degree of danger. He describes the wicked as being already in the process of destroying him.<br>
 <a name="fn515" href="psa.htm#fnB515"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:9)  <i>Heb</i> "my enemies, at the risk of life they surround me." The Hebrew phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vpnb</FONT> sometimes has the nuance "at the risk of [one's] life" (see 1 Kgs 2:23; Prov 7:23; Lam 5:9).<br>
 <a name="fn516" href="psa.htm#fnB516"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:10)  <i>Heb</i> "their fat they close." The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">blj</FONT> ("fat") appears to stand by metonymy for their calloused hearts. They attack the psalmist without feeling any pity or remorse. Some propose emending the text to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wmbl blj</FONT> ("fat of their heart[s]; cf. Ps 119:70, "their heart is insensitive like fat"). This assumes haplography of the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bl</FONT> consonantal sequence.<br>

The Kethib (consonantal text) has "surround me," while the Qere (marginal reading) has "surround us," harmonizing the pronoun to the preceding "our steps." The first person plural pronoun does not fit the context, where the psalmist speaks as an individual. In the preceding verses the psalmist uses a first person singular verbal or pronominal form twenty times. For this reason it is preferable to emend "our steps" to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn]WrV=a!</FONT> ("they attack me") from the verbal root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> ("march, stride, track"). For this verb, see <i>HALOT</i> 97.<br>

For other uses of the plural form of the Hiphil participle of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twm</FONT> ("die"), see 2 Kgs 17:26 (used with lions as subject), Job 33:22 (apparently referring to the agents of death), and Jer 26:15 (used of those seeking Jeremiah's life).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (17:14)  <i>You overwhelm them with the riches they desire.</i> The psalmist is not accusing God of being unjust; he is simply observing that the wicked often prosper and that God is the ultimate source of all blessings that human beings enjoy (see Matt 5:45). When the wicked are ungrateful for God's blessings, they become even more culpable and deserving of judgment. So this description of the wicked actually supports the psalmist's appeal for deliverance. God should rescue him because he is innocent (see vv. 3-5) and because the wicked, though blessed abundantly by God, still have the audacity to attack God's people.<br>
 <a name="fn531" href="psa.htm#fnB531"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:14)  <i>Heb</i> "they are satisfied [with] sons and leave their abundance to their children."<br>
 <a name="fn532" href="psa.htm#fnB532"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:15)  <i>Heb</i> "I, in innocence, I will see your face." To "see" God's "face" means to have access to his presence and to experience his favor (see Ps 11:7; see also Job 33:26 [where <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">har</FONT>, not <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hzj</FONT>, is used]). Here, however, the psalmist may be anticipating a mystical experience. See the following note on the word "me."<br>
 <a name="fn533" href="psa.htm#fnB533"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:15)  <i>Heb</i> "I will be satisfied, when I awake, [with] your form." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnwmt</FONT> normally carries the nuance "likeness" or "form" (see BDB 568). In Job 4:16 it refers to a ghostlike spiritual entity (see v. 15) that revealed itself to Eliphaz during the night. The psalmist may anticipate a mystical encounter with God in which he expects to see a manifestation of God's presence (i.e., a theophany), perhaps in conjunction with an oracle of deliverance. During the quiet darkness of the night, God examines the psalmist's inner motives and finds them to be pure (see v. 3). The psalmist is confident that when he awakens, perhaps sometime during the night or in the morning, he will be visited by God and assured of vindication.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (17:15)  <i>When I awake you will reveal yourself to me</i>. Some see in this verse an allusion to resurrection. According to this view, when the psalmist awakens from the sleep of death, he will see God. It is unlikely that the psalmist had such a highly developed personal eschatology. As noted above, it is more likely that he is anticipating a divine visitation and mystical encounter as a prelude to his deliverance from his enemies.<br>
 <a name="fn534" href="psa.htm#fnB534"><sup>39</sup></a><b>sn</b> (17:15)  <i>Psalm 18</i>. In this long song of thanks, the psalmist (a Davidic king, traditionally understood as David himself) affirms that God is his faithful protector. He recalls in highly poetic fashion how God intervened in awesome power and delivered him from death. The psalmist's experience demonstrates that God vindicates those who are blameless and remain loyal to him. True to his promises, God gives the king victory on the battlefield and enables him to subdue nations. A parallel version of the psalm appears in 2 Sam 22:1-51.<br>

Other translations (e.g., NAB) include the introductory "he said" at the beginning of v. 1.<br>
 <a name="fn540" href="psa.htm#fnB540"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:1)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;jr</FONT> elsewhere appears in the Piel (or Pual) verbal stem with the basic meaning, "have compassion." The verb occurs only here in the basic (Qal) stem. The basic stem of the verbal root also occurs in Aramaic with the meaning "love" (see <i>DNWSI</i>, 1068-69; Jastrow, 1467; G. Schmuttermayr, <i>Bib</i> 51 [1970] 515-21). Since this introductory statement does not appear in the parallel version in 2 Sam 22:1-51, it is possible that it is a later addition to the psalm, made when the poem was revised for use in worship.<br>
 <a name="fn541" href="psa.htm#fnB541"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:1)  <i>Heb</i> "my strength." "Strength" is metonymic here, referring to the Lord as the one who bestows strength to the psalmist; thus the translation "my source of strength."<br>

 <a name="fn545" href="psa.htm#fnB545"><sup>7</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:2)  <i>Take shelter</i>. "Taking shelter" in the Lord is an idiom for seeking his protection. Seeking his protection presupposes and even demonstrates the subject's loyalty to the Lord. In the psalms those who "take shelter" in the Lord are contrasted with the wicked and equated with those who love, fear and serve the Lord (Pss 5:11-12; 31:17-20; 34:21-22).<br>
 <a name="fn546" href="psa.htm#fnB546"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:2)  <i>Heb</i> "the horn of my salvation"; or "my saving horn."<br>
 <b>sn </b> (18:2) Though some see "horn" as referring to a horn-shaped peak of a hill, or to the "horns" of an altar where one could find refuge, it is more likely that the horn of an ox underlies the metaphor (cf. Deut 33:17; 1 Kgs 22:11; Ps 92:10). The horn of the wild ox is frequently a metaphor for military strength; the idiom "exalt the horn" signifies military victory (see 1 Sam 2:10; Pss 89:17, 24; 92:10; Lam 2:17). In the ancient Near East powerful warrior-kings would sometimes compare themselves to a goring bull that uses its horns to kill its enemies. For examples, see P. Miller, <i>HTR</i> 60 (1967): 422-25, and R. B. Chisholm, <i>Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22</i>, 135-36. Ps 18:2 uses the metaphor of the horn in a slightly different manner. Here the Lord himself is compared to a horn. He is to the psalmist what the horn is to the ox, a source of defense and victory.<br>

However, the various epithets in vv. 1-2 have the first person pronominal suffix, unlike <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">llhm</FONT>. If one follows the traditional verse division and takes <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">llhm</FONT> with what follows, it is best understood as substantival and as appositional to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwhy</FONT>, "[to the] praiseworthy one I cried out, [to the] LORD."<br>
 <a name="fn550" href="psa.htm#fnB550"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tc</b> (18:4)  Ps 18:4 reads "ropes," while 2 Sam 22:5 reads "waves." The reading of the psalm has been influenced by the next verse (note "ropes of Sheol") and perhaps also by Ps 116:3 (where "ropes of death" appears, as here, with the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[pa</FONT>). However, the parallelism of v. 4 (note "currents" in the next line) favors the reading "waves." While the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[pa</FONT> is used with "ropes" as subject in Ps 116:3, it can also be used with engulfing "waters" as subject (see Jon 2:5). Death is compared to surging waters in v. 4 and to a hunter in v. 5.<br>

It is often associated with rebellion against authority and other crimes that result in societal disorder and anarchy. The phrase "man/son of wickedness" refers to one who opposes God and the order he has established. The term becomes an appropriate title for death, which, through human forces, launches an attack against God's chosen servant.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (18:10)  <i>Winged angel</i> (<i>Heb</i> "cherub"). Cherubs, as depicted in the OT, possess both human and animal (lion, ox, and eagle) characteristics (see Ezek 1:10; 10:14, 21; 41:18). They are pictured as winged creatures (Exod 25:20; 37:9; 1 Kgs 6:24-27; Ezek 10:8, 19) and serve as the very throne of God when the ark of the covenant is in view (Pss 80:1; 99:1; see Num 7:89; 1 Sam 4:4; 2 Sam 6:2; 2 Kgs 19:15). The picture of the LORD seated on the cherubs suggests they might be used by him as a vehicle, a function they carry out in Ezek 1:22-28 (the "living creatures" mentioned here are identified as cherubs in Ezek 10:20). In Ps 18:10 the image of a cherub serves to personify the wind (see the next line of the psalm).<br>

The noun "darkness" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tkvj</FONT>) is probably a corruption of an original reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">trvj</FONT>, a form that is preserved in 2 Sam 22:12. The latter is a construct form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrvj</FONT> ("sieve") which occurs only here in the OT. A cognate Ugaritic noun means "sieve," and a related verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rvj</FONT> ("to sift") is attested in post-biblical Hebrew and Aramaic (see <i>HALOT</i> 363).

As vv. 22-24 make clear, the psalmist refers here to his unwavering obedience to God's commands. In these verses the psalmist explains that the LORD was pleased with him and willing to deliver him because he had been loyal to God and obedient to his commandments. Ancient Near Eastern literature contains numerous parallels. A superior (a god or king) would typically reward a subject (a king or the servant of a king, respectively) for loyalty and obedience. See R. B. Chisholm, <i>Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22</i>, 211-13.<br>
 <a name="fn596" href="psa.htm#fnB596"><sup>58</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:20)  The unreduced Hiphil prefixed verbal form appears to be an imperfect, in which case the psalmist would be generalizing. However, both the preceding and following contexts (see especially v. 24) suggest he is narrating his experience. Despite its unreduced form, the verb is better taken as a preterite. For other examples of unreduced Hiphil preterites, see Pss 55:14a; 68:9a, 10b; 80:8a; 89:43a; 107:38b; 116:6b.<br>

The phrase "ways of the LORD" refers here to the "conduct required" by the LORD (see <i>HALOT</i> 232). In Ps 25 the LORD's "ways" are associated with his covenantal demands (see vv. 4, 9-10). See also Ps 119:3 (cf. vv. 1, 4), as well as Deut 8:6; 10:12; 11:22; 19:9; 26:17; 28:9; 30:16.<br>
 <a name="fn599" href="psa.htm#fnB599"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:21)  <i>Heb</i> "I have not acted wickedly from my God." The statement is elliptical; the idea is, "I have not acted wickedly and, in so doing, departed from my God."<br>
 <a name="fn600" href="psa.htm#fnB600"><sup>62</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:22)  <i>Heb</i> "for all his regulations [are] before me." The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yfpvm</FONT> ("regulations") refers to God's covenantal requirements, especially those which the king is responsible to follow (cf. Deut 17:18-20). See also Pss 19:9 (cf. vv. 7-8); 89:30; 147:20 (cf. v. 19), as well as the numerous uses of the term in Ps 119.<br>

The prefixed verbal form is probably an imperfect; the psalmist here generalizes about his loyalty to God's commands. The Lord's "rules" are the stipulations of the covenant which the king was responsible to obey (see Ps 89:31; cf. v. 30 and Deut 17:18-20).<br>
 <a name="fn602" href="psa.htm#fnB602"><sup>64</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:23)  <i>Heb</i> "from my sin," that is, from making it my own in any way.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (18:23)  <i>Kept myself from sinning</i>. Leading a blameless life meant that the king would be loyal to God's covenant, purge the government and society of evil and unjust officials, and reward loyalty to the Lord (see Ps 101).<br>

The verbal repetition (compare vv. 20 and 24) sets off vv. 20-24 as a distinct sub-unit within the psalm.<br>
 <a name="fn605" href="psa.htm#fnB605"><sup>67</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:25)  The imperfect verbal forms in vv. 25-29 draw attention to God's characteristic actions. Based on his experience, the psalmist generalizes about God's just dealings with people (vv. 25-27) and about the way in which God typically empowers him on the battlefield (vv. 28-29). The Hitpael stem is used in vv. 26-27 in a reflexive resultative (or causative) sense. God makes himself loyal, etc. in the sense that he conducts or reveals himself as such. On this use of the Hitpael stem, see GKC &#167;54.<i>e</i>.<br>

In Gen 30:8 it means literally "to wrestle," or "to twist." In Job 5:13 it refers to devious individuals, and in Prov 8:8 to deceptive words.<br>
 <a name="fn611" href="psa.htm#fnB611"><sup>73</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:26)  The adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vqu</FONT> has the basic nuance "twisted, crooked," and by extension refers to someone or something that is morally perverse. It appears frequently in Proverbs, where it is used of evil people (22:5), speech (8:8; 19:1), thoughts (11:20; 17:20), and life styles (2:15; 28:6). A righteous king opposes such people (Ps 101:4).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (18:26)  Verses 25-26 affirm God's justice. He responds to people in accordance with their moral character. His response mirrors their actions. The faithful and blameless find God to be <i>loyal</i> and <i>reliable</i> in his dealings with them. But deceivers discover he is able and willing to use deceit to destroy them. For a more extensive discussion of the theme of divine deception in the OT, see R. B. Chisholm, <i>BSac</i> 155 (1998): 11-28.<br>

The Ps 18 reading may preserve two variants, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yrn</FONT> ("my lamp") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yrwa</FONT> ("my light"), cf. Ps 27:1. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ryat</FONT> ("you light") in Ps 18:28 would, in this case, be a corruption of the latter. See F. M. Cross and D. N. Freedman, <i>Studies in Ancient Yahwistic Poetry</i>, 150, n. 64. The metaphor, which likens the LORD to a lamp or light, pictures him as the psalmist's source of life. For other examples of "lamp" used in this way, see Job 18:6; 21:17; Prov 13:9; 20:20; 24:20. For other examples of "light" as a symbol for life, see Job 3:20; 33:30; Ps 56:13.<br>

 <a name="fn620" href="psa.htm#fnB620"><sup>82</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:29)  <i>Heb</i> "I will run." The imperfect verbal forms in v. 29 indicate the subject's potential or capacity to perform an action. Though one might expect a preposition to follow the verb here, this need not be the case with the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jwr</FONT> (see 1 Sam 17:22). Some emend the Qal to a Hiphil form of the verb and translate, "I put to flight [<i>Heb</i> "cause to run"] an army."<br>
 <a name="fn621" href="psa.htm#fnB621"><sup>83</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:29)  More specifically, the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dwdg</FONT> refers to a raiding party or to a contingent of troops (<i>HALOT</i> 177).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (18:29)  <i>I can charge against an army</i>. The picture of a divinely empowered warrior charging against an army in almost superhuman fashion appears elsewhere in ancient Near Eastern literature. See R. B. Chisholm, <i>Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22</i>, 228.<br>

 <a name="fn624" href="psa.htm#fnB624"><sup>86</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:30)  <i>Heb</i> "[As for] the God, his way is blameless." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lah</FONT> ("the God") stands as a nominative (or genitive) absolute in apposition to the resumptive pronominal suffix on "way." The prefixed article emphasizes his distinctiveness as the one true God (see BDB 42 and Deut 33:26). God's "way" in this context refers to his protective and salvific acts in fulfillment of his promise (see also Deut 32:4; Pss 67:2; 77:13 [note vv. 11-12, 14]; 103:7; 138:5; 145:17).<br>
 <a name="fn625" href="psa.htm#fnB625"><sup>87</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:30)  <i>The </i>LORD'<i>s promise</i>. In the ancient Near East kings would typically seek and receive oracles from their god(s) prior to battle. For examples, see R. B. Chisholm, <i>Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22</i>, 241-42.<br>
 <a name="fn626" href="psa.htm#fnB626"><sup>88</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:30)  <i>Heb</i> "the word of the LORD is purified." The LORD's "word" probably refers here to his oracle(s) of victory delivered to the psalmist before the battle(s) described in the following context. See also Pss 12:5-7 and 138:2-3. David frequently received such oracles before going into battle (see 1 Sam 23:2, 4-5, 10-12; 30:8; 2 Sam 5:19). The LORD's word of promise is absolutely reliable; it is compared to metal that has been refined in fire and cleansed of impurities. See Ps 12:6.<br>

 <a name="fn630" href="psa.htm#fnB630"><sup>92</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:31)  The rhetorical questions anticipate the answer, "No one." In this way the psalmist indicates that the LORD is the only true God and reliable source of protection. See also Deut 32:39, where the LORD affirms that he is the only true God. Note as well the emphasis on his role as protector (<i>Heb</i> "rocky cliff," <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rwx</FONT>) in Deut 32:4, 15, 17-18, 30.<br>

The psalmist employs a generalizing hymnic style in vv. 32-34; he uses participles in vv. 32a, 33a, and 34a to describe what God characteristically does on his behalf.<br>
 <a name="fn633" href="psa.htm#fnB633"><sup>95</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:32)  2 Sam 22:33 reads, "the God is my strong refuge."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (18:32)  <i>Gives me strength</i>. As the following context makes clear, this refers to physical and emotional strength for battle (see especially v. 39).<br>
 <a name="fn634" href="psa.htm#fnB634"><sup>96</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:32)  The prefixed verbal form with <i>vav</i> consecutive here carries along the generalizing force of the preceding participle.<br>

The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ymt</FONT> ("smooth") usually carries a moral or ethical connotation, "blameless, innocent." However, in Ps 18:33 it refers to a pathway free of obstacles. The reality underlying the metaphor is the psalmist's ability to charge into battle without tripping (see vv. 33, 36).<br>
 <a name="fn636" href="psa.htm#fnB636"><sup>98</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:33)  <i>Heb</i> "[the one who] makes my feet like [those of ] a deer."<br>

The psalmist compares his agility in battle to the ability of a deer to negotiate rugged, high terrain without falling or being injured.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (18:33)  Habakkuk uses similar language to describe his faith during difficult times. See Hab 3:19.<br>
 <a name="fn638" href="psa.htm#fnB638"><sup>100</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:34)  <i>He trains my hands</i>. The psalmist attributes his skill with weapons to divine enablement.

 <a name="fn639" href="psa.htm#fnB639"><sup>101</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:34)  <i>Heb</i> "and a bow of bronze is bent by my arms"; or "my arms bend a bow of bronze." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tjn</FONT> apparently means "pull back, bend" here (see <i>HALOT</i> 692). The third feminine singular verbal form appears to agree with the feminine singular noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tvq</FONT> ("bow"). In this case the verb must be taken as Niphal (passive). However, it is possible that "my arms" is the subject of the verb and "bow" the object. In this case the verb is Piel (active). For other examples of a feminine singular verb being construed with a plural noun, see GKC &#167;145.<i>k</i>.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (18:34)  The <i>strongest bow</i> (<i>Heb </i>"bow of bronze") probably refers to a bow laminated with bronze strips, or to a purely ceremonial or decorative bow made entirely from bronze. In the latter case the language is hyperbolic, for such a weapon would not be functional in battle.<br>
 <a name="fn640" href="psa.htm#fnB640"><sup>102</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:35)  <i>Heb</i> "and you give to me the shield of your deliverance."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (18:35)  <i>You give me your protective shield</i>. Ancient Near Eastern literature often refers to a god giving a king special weapons. See R. B. Chisholm, <i>Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22</i>, 260-61.<br>
 <a name="fn641" href="psa.htm#fnB641"><sup>103</sup></a><b>tc</b> (18:35)  2 Sam 22:36 omits this line, perhaps due to homoioarcton. A scribe's eye may have jumped from the <i>vav</i> prefixed to "your right hand" to the <i>vav</i> prefixed to the following "and your answer," causing the copyist to omit by accident the intervening words ("your right hand supports me and").<br>
 <a name="fn642" href="psa.htm#fnB642"><sup>104</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:35)  The MT of Ps 18:35 appears to read, "your condescension," apparently referring to God's willingness to intervene (cf. NIV "you stoop down"). However, the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwnu</FONT> elsewhere means "humility" and is used only here of God. The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">itwnu</FONT> may be a fully written form of the suffixed infinitive construct of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnu</FONT>, "to answer" (a defectively written form of the infinitive appears in 2 Sam 22:36). In this case the psalmist refers to God's willingness to answer his prayer; one might translate, "your favorable response."<br>

"Step" probably refers metonymically to the path upon which the psalmist walks. Another option is to translate, "you widen my stride."

 <b>sn</b> (18:41)  <i>They cry out</i>. This reference to the psalmists' enemies crying out for help to the LORD suggests that the psalmist refers here to enemies within the covenant community, rather than foreigners. However, the militaristic context suggests foreign enemies are in view. Ancient Near Eastern literature indicates that defeated enemies would sometimes cry out for mercy to the god(s) of their conqueror. See R. B. Chisholm, <i>Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22</i>, 271.<br>

It is likely that the latter is a conflation of variants. One, but not both, of the verbs in 2 Sam 22:43 is probably original; "empty out" does not form as good a parallel with "grind, pulverize" in the parallel line.<br>

In this context the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">byr</FONT> ("striving") probably has a militaristic sense (as in Judg 12:2; Isa 41:11), and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;u</FONT> ("people") probably refers more specifically to an army (for other examples, see the verses listed in BDB 766 (2.d). Some understand the phrase as referring to attacks by the psalmists' own countrymen, the "nation" being Israel. However, foreign enemies appear to be in view; note the reference to "nations" in the following line.<br>

In this context "know" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">udy</FONT>) probably refers to formal recognition by treaty. People who were once not under the psalmist's authority now willingly submit to his rulership to avoid being conquered militarily (see vv. 44-45). The language may recall the events recorded in 2 Sam 8:9-10 and 10:19.<br>
 <a name="fn662" href="psa.htm#fnB662"><sup>124</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:44)  <i>Heb</i> "at a report of an ear they submit to me." The report of the psalmist's exploits is so impressive that those who hear it submit to his rulership without putting up a fight.<br>
 <a name="fn663" href="psa.htm#fnB663"><sup>125</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:44)  For the meaning "be weak, powerless" for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vjk</FONT>, see Ps 109:24. The next line (see v. 45a), in which "foreigners" are also mentioned, favors this interpretation. Another option is to translate "cower in fear" (see Deut 33:29; Pss 66:3; 81:15; cf. NIV "cringe"; NRSV "came cringing").<br>
 <a name="fn664" href="psa.htm#fnB664"><sup>126</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:45)  <i>Heb</i> "wither, wear out."<br>
 <a name="fn665" href="psa.htm#fnB665"><sup>127</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:45)  The meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">grj</FONT> ("shake") is established on the basis of cognates in Arabic and Aramaic (<i>HALOT</i> 350). 2 Sam 22:46 reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rgj</FONT>, which might mean here, "[they] come limping" (on the basis of a cognate in post-biblical Hebrew). The normal meaning for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rgj</FONT>, "gird," makes little sense here.<br>
 <a name="fn666" href="psa.htm#fnB666"><sup>128</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:45)  <i>Heb</i> "from."<br>
 <a name="fn667" href="psa.htm#fnB667"><sup>129</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:45)  <i>Heb</i> "their prisons." The besieged cities of the foreigners are compared to prisons.<br>
 <a name="fn668" href="psa.htm#fnB668"><sup>130</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:46)  Elsewhere the construction <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwhy-yj</FONT> is used exclusively as an oath formula, "as surely as the LORD lives," but this is not the case here, for no oath follows. Here the statement is an affirmation of the LORD's active presence and intervention. In contrast to pagan deities, he demonstrates he is the living God by rescuing and empowering the psalmist.<br>
 <a name="fn669" href="psa.htm#fnB669"><sup>131</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:46)  <i>Heb</i> "my rocky cliff," which is a metaphor for protection. See similar phrases in vv. 2, 31.<br>
 <a name="fn670" href="psa.htm#fnB670"><sup>132</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:46)  Or "blessed [i.e., praised] be."<br>
 <a name="fn671" href="psa.htm#fnB671"><sup>133</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:46)  <i>Heb</i> "the God of my deliverance." 2 Sam 22:48 reads, "the God of the rocky cliff of my deliverance."<br>
 <a name="fn672" href="psa.htm#fnB672"><sup>134</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:46)  The words "as king" are supplied in the translation for clarification. Elsewhere in the psalms the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;wr</FONT> ("be exalted"), when used of God, refers to his exalted position as king (Pss 99:2; 113:4; 138:6) and/or his self-revelation as king through his mighty deeds of deliverance (Pss 21:13; 46:10; 57:5, 11).<br>
 <a name="fn673" href="psa.htm#fnB673"><sup>135</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:47)  <i>Heb</i> "the God." See v. 32.<br>
 <a name="fn674" href="psa.htm#fnB674"><sup>136</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:47)  <i>Heb</i> "is the one who grants vengeance to me." The plural form of the noun indicates degree here, suggesting complete vengeance or vindication.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (18:47)  <i>Completely vindicates me</i>. In the ancient Near East military victory was sometimes viewed as a sign that one's God had judged in favor of the victor, avenging and/or vindicating him. See, for example, Judg 11:27, 32-33, 36.<br>
 <a name="fn675" href="psa.htm#fnB675"><sup>137</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:47)  <i>Heb</i> "he subdues nations beneath me." On the meaning of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rbd</FONT> ("subdue," a homonym of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rbd</FONT>, "speak"), see <i>HALOT</i> 209-10. See also Ps 47:3 and 2 Chr 22:10. 2 Sam 22:48 reads "and [is the one who] brings down nations beneath me."<br>
 <a name="fn676" href="psa.htm#fnB676"><sup>138</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:48)  <i>Heb</i> "[the one who] delivers me." 2 Sam 22:49 reads "and [the one who] brings me out."<br>
 <a name="fn677" href="psa.htm#fnB677"><sup>139</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:48)  <i>Heb</i> "lifts me up." In light of the preceding and following references to deliverance, the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;wr</FONT> probably here refers to being rescued from danger (see Ps 9:13). However, it could mean "exalt, elevate" here, indicating that the LORD has given the psalmist victory over his enemies and forced them to acknowledge the psalmist's superiority (cf. NIV, NRSV).<br>
 <a name="fn678" href="psa.htm#fnB678"><sup>140</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:48)  <i>Heb</i> "from those who rise against me."<br>
 <a name="fn679" href="psa.htm#fnB679"><sup>141</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:49)  <i>I will give you thanks before the nations</i>. This probably alludes to the fact that the psalmist will praise the LORD in the presence of the defeated nations when they, as his subjects, bring their tribute payments. Ideally the Davidic king was to testify to the nations of God's greatness. See J. H. Eaton, <i>Kingship and the Psalms</i>, 182-85.<br>
 <a name="fn680" href="psa.htm#fnB680"><sup>142</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:49)  <i>Heb</i> "to your name." God's "name" refers metonymically to his divine characteristics as suggested by his name, in this case "LORD," the primary name of Israel's covenant God which suggests his active presence with his people (see Exod 3:12-15).<br>
 <a name="fn681" href="psa.htm#fnB681"><sup>143</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:50)  Or "the one who."<br>
 <a name="fn682" href="psa.htm#fnB682"><sup>144</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:50)  <i>Heb</i> "magnifies the victories of his king." "His king" refers to the psalmist, the Davidic king whom God has chosen to rule Israel.<br>
 <a name="fn683" href="psa.htm#fnB683"><sup>145</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:50)  <i>Heb</i> "[the one who] does loyalty."<br>
 <a name="fn684" href="psa.htm#fnB684"><sup>146</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:50)  <i>Heb</i> "his anointed [one]," i.e., the psalmist/Davidic king. See Ps 2:2.<br>
 <a name="fn685" href="psa.htm#fnB685"><sup>147</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:50)  Or "offspring"; <i>Heb</i> "seed."<br>
 <a name="fn686" href="psa.htm#fnB686"><sup>148</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:50)  If <i>David</i> is the author of the psalm (see the superscription), then he here anticipates that God will continue to demonstrate loyalty to his descendants who succeed him. If the author is a later Davidic king, then he views the divine favor he has experienced as the outworking of God's faithful promises to David his ancestor.<br>
 <a name="fn687" href="psa.htm#fnB687"><sup>149</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:50)  <i>Psalm 19</i>. The psalmist praises God for his self-revelation in the heavens and in the Mosaic law. The psalmist concludes with a prayer, asking the Lord to keep him from sinning and to approve of his thoughts and words.<br>
 <a name="fn688" href="psa.htm#fnB688"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:1)  God's "glory" refers here to his royal majesty and power.<br>
 <a name="fn689" href="psa.htm#fnB689"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:1)  <i>Heb</i> "and the work of his hands the sky declares." The participles emphasize the ongoing testimony of the heavens/sky.<br>
 <a name="fn690" href="psa.htm#fnB690"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:2)  <i>Heb</i> "it gushes forth a word." The "sky" (see v. 1b) is the subject of the verb. Though not literally speaking (see v. 3), it clearly reveals God's royal majesty. The sun's splendor and its movement across the sky is in view (see vv. 4-6).<br>
 <a name="fn691" href="psa.htm#fnB691"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:2)  <i>Heb</i> "it [i.e., the sky] declares knowledge," i.e., knowledge about God's royal majesty and power (see v. 1). This apparently refers to the splendor and movements of the stars. The imperfect verbal forms in v. 2, like the participles in the preceding verse, combine with the temporal phrases ("day after day" and "night after night") to emphasize the ongoing testimony of the sky.<br>
 <a name="fn692" href="psa.htm#fnB692"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:3)  <i>Heb</i> "their." The antecedent of the plural pronoun is "heavens" (v. 1).<br>
 <a name="fn693" href="psa.htm#fnB693"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tc</b> (19:4)  The MT reads, "their measuring line" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;wq</FONT>). The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wq</FONT> ("measuring line") makes no sense in this context. The reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;lwq</FONT> ("their voice") which is supported by the LXX, is preferable.<br>
 <a name="fn694" href="psa.htm#fnB694"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:4)  <i>Heb</i> "goes out," or "proceeds forth."<br>
 <a name="fn695" href="psa.htm#fnB695"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:4)  <i>Heb</i> "their" (see the note on the word "its" in v. 3).<br>
 <a name="fn696" href="psa.htm#fnB696"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:4)  The verb is supplied in the translation. The Hebrew text has no verb; <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">axy</FONT> ("goes out") is understood by ellipsis.<br>
 <a name="fn697" href="psa.htm#fnB697"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:4)  <i>Heb</i> "to the end of the world."<br>
 <a name="fn698" href="psa.htm#fnB698"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:4)  <i>Heb</i> "in them" (i.e., the heavens).<br>
 <a name="fn699" href="psa.htm#fnB699"><sup>12</sup></a><b>sn</b> (19:4)  <i>He has pitched a tent for the sun</i>. The personified sun emerges from this "tent" in order to make its daytime journey across the sky. So the "tent" must refer metaphorically to the place where the sun goes to rest during the night.<br>
 <a name="fn700" href="psa.htm#fnB700"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:5)  The participle expresses the repeated or regular nature of the action.<br>
 <a name="fn701" href="psa.htm#fnB701"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:5)  The Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hP*j%</FONT> ("chamber") occurs elsewhere only in Isa 4:5 and Joel 2:16 (where it refers to the bedroom of a bride and groom).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (19:5)  <i>Like a bridegroom.</i> The metaphor likens the sun to a bridegroom who emerges from the bedroom thoroughly satisfied and full of joy.<br>
 <a name="fn702" href="psa.htm#fnB702"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:5)  The imperfect verbal form draws attention to the regularity of the action.<br>
 <a name="fn703" href="psa.htm#fnB703"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:5)  <i>Heb</i> "[on] a path."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (19:5)  <i>Like a strong man.</i> The metaphorical language reflects the brilliance of the sunrise, which attests to the sun's vigor.<br>
 <a name="fn704" href="psa.htm#fnB704"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:6)  <i>Heb</i> "from the end of the heavens [is] its going forth."<br>
 <a name="fn705" href="psa.htm#fnB705"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:6)  <i>Heb</i> "and its circuit [is] to their ends."<br>
 <a name="fn706" href="psa.htm#fnB706"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:6)  <i>Heb</i> "is hidden from."<br>
 <a name="fn707" href="psa.htm#fnB707"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:7)  <i>Heb</i> "[it] restores life." Elsewhere the Hiphil of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwv</FONT> ("return") when used with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vpn</FONT> ("life") as object, means to "rescue or preserve one's life" (Job 33:30; Ps 35:17) or to "revive one's strength" (emotionally or physically; cf. Ruth 4:15; Lam 1:11, 16, 19). Here the point seems to be that the law preserves the life of the one who studies it by making known God's will. Those who know God's will know how to please him and can avoid offending him. See v. 11a.<br>
 <a name="fn708" href="psa.htm#fnB708"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:7)  Traditionally, "the testimony of the LORD." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twdu</FONT> refers here to the demands of God's covenant law.<br>
 <a name="fn709" href="psa.htm#fnB709"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:7)  God's covenant contains a clear, reliable witness to his moral character and demands.<br>
 <a name="fn710" href="psa.htm#fnB710"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:7)  Or "the [morally] naive," that is, the one who is young and still in the process of learning right from wrong and distinguishing wisdom from folly.<br>
 <a name="fn711" href="psa.htm#fnB711"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:8)  Or "just." Perhaps the idea is that they impart a knowledge of what is just and right.<br>
 <a name="fn712" href="psa.htm#fnB712"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:8)  <i>Heb</i> "[they] make happy [the] heart." Perhaps the point is that they bring a sense of joyful satisfaction to the one who knows and keeps them, for those who obey God's law are richly rewarded. See v. 11b.<br>
 <a name="fn713" href="psa.htm#fnB713"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:8)  <i>Heb</i> "command." The singular here refers to the law as a whole.<br>
 <a name="fn714" href="psa.htm#fnB714"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:8)  Because they reflect God's character, his commands provide a code of moral and ethical purity.<br>
 <a name="fn715" href="psa.htm#fnB715"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:8)  <i>Heb</i> [they] enlighten [the] eyes.<br>
 <a name="fn716" href="psa.htm#fnB716"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:9)  <i>Heb</i> "the fear of the LORD is clean." The phrase "fear of the LORD" probably refers here to the law, which teaches one how to demonstrate proper reverence for the LORD. See Ps 111:10 for another possible use of the phrase in this sense.<br>
 <a name="fn717" href="psa.htm#fnB717"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:9)  <i>Heb</i> "[it] stands permanently."<br>
 <a name="fn718" href="psa.htm#fnB718"><sup>31</sup></a><b>sn</b> (19:9)  <i>Trustworthy and completely just</i>. The Lord's commands accurately reflect God's moral will for his people and are an expression of his just character.<br>
 <a name="fn719" href="psa.htm#fnB719"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:10)  <i>Heb</i> "more desirable."<br>
 <a name="fn720" href="psa.htm#fnB720"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:10)  <i>Heb</i> "are sweeter." God's law is "sweet' in the sense that, when obeyed, it brings a great reward (see v. 11b).<br>
 <a name="fn721" href="psa.htm#fnB721"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:11)  <i>Heb</i> "moreover your servant is warned by them."<br>
 <a name="fn722" href="psa.htm#fnB722"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:11)  <i>Heb</i> "in the keeping of them [there is] a great reward."<br>
 <a name="fn723" href="psa.htm#fnB723"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:12)  <i>Heb</i> "Errors who can discern?" This rhetorical question makes the point that perfect moral discernment is impossible to achieve. Consequently it is inevitable that even those with good intentions will sin on occasion.<br>
 <a name="fn724" href="psa.htm#fnB724"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:12)  <i>Heb</i> "declare me innocent from hidden [things]," i.e., sins. In this context (see the preceding line) "hidden" sins are not sins committed in secret, but sins which are not recognized as such by the psalmist.<br>
 <a name="fn725" href="psa.htm#fnB725"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:13)  Or "presumptuous."<br>
 <a name="fn726" href="psa.htm#fnB726"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:13)  <i>Heb</i> "let them not rule over me."<br>
 <a name="fn727" href="psa.htm#fnB727"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:13)  <i>Heb</i> "great."<br>
 <a name="fn728" href="psa.htm#fnB728"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:14)  <i>Heb</i> "may the words of my mouth and the thought of my heart be acceptable before you." The prefixed verbal form at the beginning of the verse is understood as a jussive of prayer. Another option is to translate the form as an imperfect continuing the thought of v. 14b: "[Then] the words of my mouth and the thought of my heart will be acceptable before you."<br>
 <a name="fn729" href="psa.htm#fnB729"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:14)  <i>Heb</i> "my rocky cliff," which is a metaphor for protection.<br>
 <a name="fn730" href="psa.htm#fnB730"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:14)  Or "guardian, redeemer." The metaphor casts the Lord in the role of a leader who protects members of his extended family in times of need and crisis.<br>
 <a name="fn731" href="psa.htm#fnB731"><sup>44</sup></a><b>sn</b> (19:14)  <i>Psalm 20</i>. The people pray for the king's success in battle. When the king declares his assurance that the Lord will answer the people's prayer, they affirm their confidence in God's enablement.<br>
 <a name="fn732" href="psa.htm#fnB732"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:1)  The prefixed verbal forms here and in vv. 1b-5 are interpreted as jussives of prayer (cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV). Another option is to understand them as imperfects, "the LORD will answer," etc. In this case the people declare their confidence that the LORD will intervene on behalf of the king and extend to him his favor.<br>
 <a name="fn733" href="psa.htm#fnB733"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:1)  <i>May the </i>LORD<i> answer you</i>. The people address the king as they pray to the Lord.<br>
 <a name="fn734" href="psa.htm#fnB734"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:1)  <i>Heb</i> "in a day of trouble."<br>
 <a name="fn735" href="psa.htm#fnB735"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:1)  <i>Heb</i> "the name of the God of Jacob." God's "name" refers metonymically to his very person and to the divine characteristics suggested by his name, in this case "God of Jacob," which highlights his relationship to Israel.<br>
 <a name="fn736" href="psa.htm#fnB736"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tc</b> (20:2)  <i>Heb</i> "from [the] temple." The third masculine singular pronominal suffix (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/</FONT>) has probably been accidentally omitted by haplography. Note that the following word begins with a prefixed <i>vav</i>. See P. C. Craigie, <i>Psalms 1-50</i>, 184.<br>
 <a name="fn737" href="psa.htm#fnB737"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:3)  Or "remember." For other examples of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rkz</FONT> carrying the nuance "take notice of," see Pss 8:4 and 9:12.<br>
 <a name="fn738" href="psa.htm#fnB738"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tc</b> (20:3)  <i>Heb</i> "consider as fat." See <i>HALOT</i> 234. The verbal form should probably be emended to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">h*n\V=d~y+</FONT>, the final <i>he</i> being understood as a third feminine singular pronominal suffix referring back to the feminine noun "burnt sacrifice."<br>
 <a name="fn739" href="psa.htm#fnB739"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:4)  <i>Heb</i> "may he give to you according to your heart." This probably refers to the king's prayer for protection and victory in battle. See vv. 5-6.<br>
 <a name="fn740" href="psa.htm#fnB740"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:4)  <i>May he bring all your plans to pass</i>. This probably refers to the king's strategy for battle.<br>
 <a name="fn741" href="psa.htm#fnB741"><sup>10</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:5)  <i>Your victory</i>. Here the king is addressed (see v. 1).<br>
 <a name="fn742" href="psa.htm#fnB742"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tc</b> (20:5)  The Hebrew verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lgd</FONT> occurs only here in the Qal. If accepted as original, it may carry the nuance "raise a banner," but it is preferable to emend the form to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lygn</FONT> ("we will rejoice") which provides better parallelism with "shout for joy" and fits well with the prepositional phrase "in the name of our God" (see Ps 89:16).<br>
 <a name="fn743" href="psa.htm#fnB743"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:6)  Or "know."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (20:6)  <i>Now I am sure</i>. The speaker is not identified. It is likely that the king, referring to himself in the third person (note "his chosen king"), responds to the people's prayer. Perhaps his confidence is due to the reception of a divine oracle of salvation.<br>
 <a name="fn744" href="psa.htm#fnB744"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:6)  The perfect verbal form is probably used rhetorically to state that the deliverance is as good as done. In this way the speaker emphasizes the certainty of the deliverance. Another option is to take the statement as generalizing; the psalmist affirms that the LORD typically delivers the king.<br>
 <a name="fn745" href="psa.htm#fnB745"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:6)  <i>Heb</i> "his anointed one." This title refers to the Davidic king. See Pss 2:2 and 18:50.<br>

 <a name="fn747" href="psa.htm#fnB747"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:6)  <i>Heb</i> "from his holy heavens."<br>
 <a name="fn748" href="psa.htm#fnB748"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:6)  <i>Heb</i> "with mighty acts of deliverance of his right hand." The Lord's "right hand" here symbolizes his power to protect and deliver (see Ps 17:7).<br>
 <a name="fn749" href="psa.htm#fnB749"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:7)  <i>Heb</i> "these in chariots and these in horses." No verb appears; perhaps the verb "invoke" is to be supplied from the following line. In this case the idea would be that some "invoke" (i.e., trust in) their military might for victory (cf. NEB "boast"; NIV "trust"; NRSV "take pride"). Verse 8 suggests that the "some/others" mentioned here are the nation's enemies.<br>
 <a name="fn750" href="psa.htm#fnB750"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:7)  The grammatical construction (conjunction + pronominal subject) highlights the contrast between God's faithful people and the others mentioned in the previous line.<br>
 <a name="fn751" href="psa.htm#fnB751"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:7)  <i>Heb</i> "we invoke the name of." The Hiphil of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rkz</FONT>, when combined with the phrase "in the name," means "to invoke" (see Josh 23:7; Isa 48:1; Amos 6:10). By invoking the LORD's name in prayer, the people demonstrate their trust in him.<br>
 <a name="fn752" href="psa.htm#fnB752"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:8)  Or "stumble and fall down."<br>
 <a name="fn753" href="psa.htm#fnB753"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:8)  The grammatical construction (conjunction + pronominal subject) highlights the contrast between God's victorious people and the defeated enemies mentioned in the previous line. The perfect verbal forms either generalize or, more likely, state rhetorically the people's confidence as they face the approaching battle. They describe the demise of the enemy as being as good as done.<br>
 <a name="fn754" href="psa.htm#fnB754"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:8)  Or "rise up and remain upright." On the meaning of the Hitpolel of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dwu</FONT>, see <i>HALOT</i> 795. The verbal forms (a perfect followed by a prefixed form with <i>vav</i> consecutive) either generalize or, more likely, state rhetorically the people's confidence as they face the approaching battle.<br>
 <a name="fn755" href="psa.htm#fnB755"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tc</b> (20:9)  This translation assumes an emendation of the verbal form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">huyvwh</FONT>. As it stands, the form is an imperative. In this case the people return to the petitionary mood with which the psalm begins ("O LORD, deliver"). But the immediate context is one of confidence (vv. 6-8), not petition (vv. 1-5). If one takes the final <i>he</i> on the verb "deliver" as dittographic (note the initial <i>he</i> on the following phrase, "the king"), one can repoint the verbal form as a perfect and understand it as expressing the people's confidence, "the LORD will deliver the king" (see v. 6). The Hebrew scribal tradition takes "the king" with the following line, in which case it would be best interpreted as a divine title, "may the King answer us" or "the king will answer us" (see Pss 98:6; 145:1). However, the poetic parallelism is better balanced if "the king" is taken with the first line. In this case the referent is the Davidic king, who is earlier called the LORD's "anointed one" (cf. note on "chosen king" in v. 6; see Pss 21:7; 45:5, 11; 63:11).<br>
 <a name="fn756" href="psa.htm#fnB756"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:9)  If the imperative is retained in the preceding line, then the prefixed verbal form is best taken as a jussive of prayer, "may he answer us."  However, if the imperative in the previous line is emended to a perfect, the prefixed form is best taken as imperfect, "he will answer us" (see the note on the word "king" at the end of the previous line).<br>

The phrase "length of days," when used of human beings, usually refers to a lengthy period of time (such as one's lifetime). See, for example, Deut 30:20; Job 12:12; Ps 91:16; Prov 3:2, 16; Lam 5:20. The additional phrase "forever and ever" is hyperbolic. While it seems to attribute eternal life to the king (see Pss 61:6-7; 72:5 as well), the underlying reality is the king's enduring dynasty. He will live on, as it were, through his descendants, who will continue to rule over his kingdom long after he has passed off the scene.<br>

The divine title "Most High" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/oyl=u#</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u#l=yo/</FONT>) pictures God as the exalted ruler of the universe who vindicates the innocent and judges the wicked. Note the focus of vv. 8-12 and see Ps 47:2.<br>
 <a name="fn773" href="psa.htm#fnB773"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:7)  Another option is to translate the imperfect verbal form as future, "he will not be upended" (cf.

 <a name="fn774" href="psa.htm#fnB774"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:8)  The king is now addressed. One could argue that the LORD is still being addressed, but v. 9 militates against this proposal, for there the LORD is mentioned in the third person and appears to be distinct from the addressee (unless, of course, one takes "LORD" in v. 9 as vocative; see the note on "them" in v. 9b). Verse 7 begins this transition to a new addressee by referring to both the king and the LORD in the third person (in vv. 1-6 the LORD is addressed and only the king referred to in the third person).<br>
 <a name="fn775" href="psa.htm#fnB775"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:8)  <i>Heb</i> "your hand finds." The idiom pictures the king grabbing hold of his enemies and defeating them (see 1 Sam 23:17). The imperfect verbal forms in vv. 8-12 may be translated with the future tense, as long as the future is understood as generalizing.<br>
 <a name="fn776" href="psa.htm#fnB776"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:8)  <i>Heb</i> "your right hand finds those who hate you."<br>

Although many modern translations retain the literal Hebrew, the statement is elliptical. The point is not that he makes them like a furnace, but like an object burned in a furnace (cf.

 <a name="fn778" href="psa.htm#fnB778"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:9)  <i>Heb</i> "at the time of your face." The "face" of the king here refers to his angry presence. See Lam 4:16.<br>

Some take "the LORD" as a vocative, in which case he is addressed in vv. 8-9a. But this makes the use of the third person in v. 9b rather awkward, though the king could be the subject (see vv. 1-7).<br>
 <a name="fn780" href="psa.htm#fnB780"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:10)  <i>Heb</i> "fruit." The next line makes it clear that offspring is in view.<br>

 <a name="fn791" href="psa.htm#fnB791"><sup>33</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:13)  <i>Psalm 22</i>. The psalmist cries out to the Lord for deliverance from his dangerous enemies, who have surrounded him and threaten his life.

 <a name="fn792" href="psa.htm#fnB792"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:13)  <i>Heb</i> "according to the doe of the dawn." Apparently this refers to a particular musical tune or style.<br>
 <a name="fn793" href="psa.htm#fnB793"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:1)  From the psalmist's perspective it seems that God has rejected him, for he fails to answer his cry for help (vv. 1b-2).<br>
 <a name="fn794" href="psa.htm#fnB794"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:1)  <i>Heb</i> "far from my deliverance [are] the words of my groaning." The Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hgav</FONT> and its related verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gav</FONT> are sometimes used of a lion's roar, but they can also describe human groaning (see Job 3:24 and Pss 32:3 and 38:8.<br>
 <a name="fn795" href="psa.htm#fnB795"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:2)  <i>Heb</i> "there is no silence to me."<br>
 <a name="fn796" href="psa.htm#fnB796"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:3)  Or "holy." The basic sense of the word "holy" is "set apart from that which is commonplace, special, unique." In this context, as often in the OT, the focus seems to be on the LORD's transcendent sovereignty. He is "set apart" from the world over which he rules. See also the notes on Isa 6:3.<br>
 <a name="fn797" href="psa.htm#fnB797"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:3)  <i>Heb</i> "[O one who] sits [on] the praises of Israel." The metaphorical language pictures the LORD as sitting enthroned in his temple, above the praises that his people Israel offer up to him.<br>

 <a name="fn801" href="psa.htm#fnB801"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:6)  The grammatical construction (conjunction + pronoun) highlights the contrast between the psalmist's experience and that of his ancestors. When he considers God's past reliability, it only heightens his despair and confusion, for God's present silence stands in stark contrast to his past saving acts.<br>
 <a name="fn802" href="psa.htm#fnB802"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:6)  Or "I am." The metaphor expresses the psalmist's self-perception, which is based on how others treat him (see the following line).<br>

The Hebrew verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">llg</FONT> here has the sense of "commit" (see Prov 16:3). The imperatival form in the Hebrew text indicates the enemies here address the psalmist. Since they refer to him in the third person in the rest of the verse, some prefer to emend the verb to a perfect, "he commits himself to the LORD."<br>
 <a name="fn810" href="psa.htm#fnB810"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:8)  <i>Heb</i> "Let him"; the referent (the LORD) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (22:8)  This statement does not necessarily reflect the enemies' actual belief, but it does reflect the psalmist's confession. The psalmist's enemies sarcastically appeal to God to help him, because he claims to be an object of divine favor. However, they probably doubted the reality of his claim.<br>
 <a name="fn813" href="psa.htm#fnB813"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:9)  The verb is derived from either <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hjg</FONT> (see <i>HALOT</i> 187) or <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jyg</FONT> (see BDB 161) and seems to carry the nuance "burst forth" or "pull out."<br>

 <a name="fn828" href="psa.htm#fnB828"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:16)  <i>Heb</i> "like a lion, my hands and my feet." This reading is often emended because it is grammatically awkward, but perhaps its awkwardness is by rhetorical design. After all, men being attacked by lions do not usually worry about grammatical correctness. Perhaps its broken syntax conveys the panic and terror felt by the psalmist. The psalmist may envision a lion pinning the hands and feet of its victim to the ground with its paws, a scene depicted in ancient Near Eastern art. The line has been traditionally translated, "they pierce my hands and feet," and then taken as foreshadowing the crucifixion of Christ. Though Jesus does appropriate the language of this psalm while on the cross (compare v. 1 with Matt 27:46 and Mark 15:34), the NT does not cite this verse in describing the death of Jesus. (It does refer to vv. 7-8 and 18, however. See Matt 27:35, 39, 43; Mark 15:24, 29; Luke 23:34; John 19:23-24.) If one were to insist on an emendation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yrak</FONT> ("like a lion") to a verb, the most likely verbal root would be <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrk</FONT> ("dig"; see the LXX). In this context this verb could refer to the gnawing and tearing of wild dogs. The ancient Greek version produced by Symmachus reads "bind" here, perhaps understanding a verbal root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">irk</FONT>, which is attested in later Hebrew and Aramaic and means "to encircle, entwine, embrace" (see <i>HALOT</i> 497-98 and Jastrow, 668). Neither one of these proposed verbs can yield a meaning "bore, pierce." It is better not to interpret this particular verse as referring to Jesus' crucifixion in a specific or direct way.<br>

 <a name="fn841" href="psa.htm#fnB841"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:21)  <i>Heb</i> "and from the horns of the wild oxen you answer me." Most take the final verb with the preceding prepositional phrase. Some understand the verb form as a relatively rare precative perfect, expressing a wish or request (see <i>IBHS</i> 494-95). However, not all grammarians are convinced that the perfect is used as a precative in biblical Hebrew. (See the discussion at Ps 3:7.) Others prefer to take the perfect in its usual indicative sense. The psalmist, perhaps in response to an oracle of salvation, affirms confidently that God has answered him, assuring him that deliverance is on the way. The present translation takes the prepositional phrase as parallel to the preceding "from the mouth of the lion" and as collocated with the verb "rescue" at the beginning of the verse. "You have answered me" is understood as a triumphant shout which marks a sudden shift in tone and introduces the next major section of the psalm. By isolating the statement syntactically, the psalmist highlights the declaration.<br>

In light of the parallelism, some prefer to emend the form to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ynvy</FONT> ("those who sleep [in the earth]"), but <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ynvd</FONT> ("fat [ones]") seems to form a merism with "all who descend into the grave" in the following line. The psalmist envisions all people, whether healthy or dying, joining in worship of the LORD.<br>
 <a name="fn859" href="psa.htm#fnB859"><sup>67</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:29)  <i>Heb</i> "eat and worship." The verb forms (a perfect followed by a prefixed form with <i>vav</i> consecutive) are normally used in narrative to relate completed actions. Here the psalmist uses the forms rhetorically as he envisions a time when the LORD will receive universal worship. The mood is one of wishful thinking and anticipation; this is not prophecy in the strict sense.<br>
 <a name="fn860" href="psa.htm#fnB860"><sup>68</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:29)  <i>Heb</i> "all of the ones going down [into] the dust."

 <a name="fn865" href="psa.htm#fnB865"><sup>73</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:31)  <i>Heb</i> "to a people [to be] born that he has acted." The words "they will tell" are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.<br>
 <a name="fn866" href="psa.htm#fnB866"><sup>74</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:31)  <i>Psalm 23</i>. In vv. 1-4 the psalmist pictures the Lord as a shepherd who provides for his needs and protects him from danger. The psalmist declares, "The Lord is my shepherd," and then extends and develops that metaphor, speaking as if he were a sheep. In vv. 5-6 the metaphor changes as the psalmist depicts a great royal banquet hosted by the Lord. The psalmist is a guest of honor and recipient of divine favor, who enjoys unlimited access to the divine palace and the divine presence.<br>
 <a name="fn867" href="psa.htm#fnB867"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (23:1)  <i>The </i>LORD<i> is my shepherd</i>. The opening metaphor suggests the psalmist is assuming the role of a sheep. In vv. 1b-4 the psalmist extends the metaphor and explains exactly how the LORD is like a shepherd to him. At the surface level the language can be understood in terms of a shepherd's relationship to his sheep. The translation of vv. 1-4 reflects this level. But, of course, each statement also points to an underlying reality.<br>
 <a name="fn868" href="psa.htm#fnB868"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:1)  The imperfect verbal form is best understood as generalizing; the psalmist highlights his typical or ongoing experience as a result of having the LORD as his shepherd (habitual present use). The next verse explains more specifically what he means by this statement.<br>
 <a name="fn869" href="psa.htm#fnB869"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:2)  <i>Heb</i> "he makes me lie down in lush pastures." The Hiphil verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ynxybry</FONT> has a causative-modal nuance here (see <i>IBHS</i> 445-46, on this use of the Hiphil), meaning "allows me to lie down" (see also Jer 33:12). The point is that the shepherd takes the sheep to lush pastures and lets them eat and rest there. Both imperfect verbal forms in v. 2 are generalizing and highlight the psalmist's typical experience.<br>
 <a name="fn870" href="psa.htm#fnB870"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:2)  Both genitives in v. 3 indicate an attribute of the noun they modify: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">avd</FONT> characterizes the pastures as "lush" (i.e., rich with vegetation), while <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twjnm</FONT> probably characterizes the water as refreshing (see BDB 630). In this case the plural indicates an abstract quality. Some take <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twjnm</FONT> in the sense of "still, calm" (i.e., as describing calm pools in contrast to dangerous torrents) but it is unlikely that such a pastoral scene is in view. Shepherds usually watered their sheep at wells (see Gen 29:2-3; Exod 2:16-19). Another option is to take <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twjnm</FONT> as "resting places" (see <i>HALOT</i> 600) and to translate, "water of/at the resting places" (i.e., a genitive of location, see <i>IBHS</i> 147-48).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (23:2)  Within the framework of the metaphor, the psalmist/sheep is declaring in v. 2 that his shepherd provides the essentials for physical life. At a deeper level the psalmist may be referring to more than just physical provision, though that would certainly be included.<br>
 <a name="fn871" href="psa.htm#fnB871"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:3)  The appearance of the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yvpn</FONT>, traditionally translated "my soul," might suggest a spiritualized interpretation for the first line of v. 3. However, at the surface level of the shepherd/sheep metaphor, this is unlikely. When it occurs with a pronominal suffix <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vpn</FONT> is often equivalent to a pronoun, especially in poetry (see BDB 660 [4]). In this context, where the statement most naturally refers to the physical provision just described, the form is best translated simply "me." The accompanying verb (a Polel form [factitive use] of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwv</FONT>), if referring to the physical provision just described, carries the nuance "refresh, restore strength."<br>
 <a name="fn872" href="psa.htm#fnB872"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:3)  The imperfect verbal forms in v. 3 (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bbwvy</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ynjny</FONT>), like those in vv. 1-2, highlight what is typical of the shepherd/sheep relationship.<br>
 <a name="fn873" href="psa.htm#fnB873"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:3)  The attributive genitive <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qdx</FONT> is traditionally translated "righteousness" here, as if designating a moral or ethical quality. But this seems unlikely, for it modifies <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ylgum</FONT> ("paths"). Within the shepherd/sheep metaphor, the phrase likely refers to "right" or "correct" paths, i.e. ones that lead to pastures, wells, or the fold. While <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qdx</FONT> usually does carry a moral or ethical nuance, it can occasionally refer to less abstract things, such as weights and offerings (see BDB 841). In this context, which emphasizes divine provision and protection, the underlying reality is probably God's providential guidance. The psalmist is confident that God takes him down paths that will ultimately lead to something beneficial, not destructive.<br>
 <a name="fn874" href="psa.htm#fnB874"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:3)  The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v</FONT> ("name") refers here to the shepherd's reputation. (The English term "name" is often used the same way.) The statement <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wmv /uml</FONT> ("for the sake of his name") makes excellent sense within the framework of the shepherd/sheep metaphor. Shepherds, who sometimes hired out their services, were undoubtedly concerned about their vocational reputation. To maintain their reputation as competent shepherds, they had to know the "lay of the land" and make sure they led the sheep down the right paths to the proper destinations. The underlying reality is a profound theological truth: God must look out for the best interests of the one he has promised to protect, because if he fails to do so, his faithfulness could legitimately be called into question and his reputation damaged.<br>
 <a name="fn875" href="psa.htm#fnB875"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:4)  The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twmlx</FONT> has traditionally been understood as a compound noun meaning "shadow of death" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lx@</FONT> + <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tw\m*</FONT>, see BDB 853). Other scholars prefer to vocalize the form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tWml=x</FONT> and understand it as an abstract noun (from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;lx</FONT>) meaning "darkness." An examination of the word's usage favors the latter derivation. It is frequently associated with darkness/night and contrasted with light/morning (see Job 3:5; 10:21-22; 12:22; 24:17; 28:3; 34:22; Ps 107:10, 14; Isa 9:1; Jer 13:16; Amos 5:8). In some cases the darkness described is associated with the realm of death (Job 10:21-22; 38:17), but this is a metaphorical application of the word and does not reflect its inherent meaning. If the word does indeed mean "darkness," it modifies <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ayg</FONT> ("valley, ravine") quite naturally. At the metaphorical level, v. 4 pictures the shepherd taking his sheep through a dark ravine where predators might lurk. The life-threatening situations faced by the psalmist are the underlying reality behind the imagery.<br>
 <a name="fn876" href="psa.htm#fnB876"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:4)  The imperfect verbal forms in v. 4, as in vv. 1-3, highlight what is typical in the psalmist's experience.<br>
 <a name="fn877" href="psa.htm#fnB877"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:4)  The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ur</FONT> is traditionally translated "evil" here, perhaps suggesting a moral or ethical nuance. But at the level of the metaphor, the word means "danger, injury, harm," as a sheep might experience from a predator. The life-threatening dangers faced by the psalmist, especially the enemies mentioned in v. 5, are the underlying reality.<br>
 <a name="fn878" href="psa.htm#fnB878"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:4)  The Piel of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;jn</FONT>, when used with a human object, means "comfort, console." But here, within the metaphorical framework, it refers to the way in which a shepherd uses his implements to assure the sheep of his presence and calm their nerves. The underlying reality is the emotional stability God provides the psalmist during life threatening situations.<br>
 <a name="fn879" href="psa.htm#fnB879"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (23:5)  In v. 5 the metaphor switches. (It would be very odd for a sheep to have its head anointed and be served wine.) The background for the imagery is probably the royal banquet. Ancient Near Eastern texts describe such banquets in similar terms to those employed by the psalmist. (See M. L. Barre and J. S. Kselman, "New Exodus, Covenant, and Restoration in Psalm 23," in <i>The Word of the Lord Shall Go Forth: Essays in Honor of David Noel Freedman</i>, ed. C. F. Meyers and M. O'Connor [Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1983] 97-127.) The reality behind the imagery is the Lord's favor. Through his blessings and protection he demonstrates to everyone, including dangerous enemies, that the psalmist has a special relationship with him.<br>
 <a name="fn880" href="psa.htm#fnB880"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:5)  The imperfect verbal form in v. 5a carries on the generalizing mood of vv. 1-4. However, in v. 5b the psalmist switches to a perfect (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tnvd</FONT>), which may have a generalizing force as well. But then again the perfect is conspicuous here and may be present perfect in sense, indicating that the divine host typically pours oil on his head prior to seating him at the banquet table. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/vd</FONT> (the Piel is factitive) is often translated "anoint," but this is misleading, for it might suggest a symbolic act of initiation into royal status. One would expect the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jvm</FONT> in this case; <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/vd</FONT> here describes an act of hospitality extended to guests and carries the nuance "refresh" (see <i>HALOT</i> 234). In Prov 15:30 it stands parallel to "make happy" and refers to the effect that good news has on the inner being of its recipient.<br>
 <a name="fn881" href="psa.htm#fnB881"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:5)  The rare noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hywr</FONT> is derived from the well-attested verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwr</FONT> ("be saturated, drink one's fill"). In this context, where it describes a cup, it must mean "filled up."<br>
 <a name="fn882" href="psa.htm#fnB882"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:6)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dsj</FONT> (v. 6) has been the subject of several monographs. Gordon Clark concludes that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dsj</FONT> "is not merely an attitude or an emotion; it is an emotion that leads to an activity beneficial to the recipient." He explains that an act of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dsj</FONT> is "a beneficent action performed, in the context of a deep and enduring commitment between two persons or parties, by one who is able to render assistance to the needy party who in the circumstances is unable to help him- or herself." (See G. R. Clark, <i>The Word </i>Hesed<i> in the Hebrew Bible</i> [Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1993] 267.) <i>HALOT</i> 336-37 defines the word as "loyalty," or "faithfulness." Other appropriate meanings might be "commitment" and "devotion."<br>
 <a name="fn883" href="psa.htm#fnB883"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:6)  The use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[dr</FONT> ("pursue, chase") with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dsjw bwf</FONT> ("goodness and faithfulness") as subject is ironic. This is the only place in the entire OT where either of these nouns appears as the subject of this verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[dr</FONT> ("pursue"). This verb is often used to describe the hostile actions of enemies. One might expect the psalmists' enemies (see v. 5) to chase him, but ironically God's "goodness and faithfulness" (which are personified and stand by metonymy for God himself) pursue him instead. The word "pursue" is used outside of its normal context in an ironic manner and creates a unique, but pleasant word picture of God's favor (or a kind God) "chasing down" the one whom he loves.<br>
 <a name="fn884" href="psa.htm#fnB884"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:6)  The verb form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ytbvw</FONT> is a Qal perfect (with <i>vav</i> consecutive), first common singular, from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwv</FONT> ("return") and should be translated, "and I will return." But this makes no sense when construed with the following phrase, "in the house of the LORD." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwv</FONT> appears only here with the following phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tybb</FONT>. The form should be emended to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yT!b=v!w+ </FONT>(an infinitive construct from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bvy</FONT> ("live") with pronominal suffix) or to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yT!b=v^y&#180;w+</FONT> (a Qal perfect with <i>vav</i> consecutive, first common singular, from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bvy</FONT> [see <i>BHS</i>, n. c]). In either case one could then translate, "and I will live [in the house of the LORD]." The phrase "in the house" frequently follows the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bvy</FONT> in the OT.<br>
 <a name="fn885" href="psa.htm#fnB885"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:6)  <i>Heb</i> "the house of the LORD." The phrase may be purely metaphorical here, referring to the royal palace where the royal host of v. 5 holds his banquet and lives. If one takes the phrase more literally, it would refer to the earthly tabernacle (if one accepts Davidic authorship) or the later temple (see Judg 19:18; 1 Sam 1:7, 24; 2 Sam 12:20; 1 Kgs 7:12, 40, 45, 51).<br>
 <a name="fn886" href="psa.htm#fnB886"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:6)  The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ymy ira</FONT> ("length of days") is traditionally translated "forever." However, this phrase, when used elsewhere of people, usually refers to a lengthy period of time, such as one's lifetime, and does not mean "forever" in the sense of eternity. (See <i>HALOT</i> 88 and Deut 30:20; Job 12:12; Ps 91:16; Prov 3:2, 16; Lam 5:20.) Furthermore, the parallel phrase "all the days of my life" suggests this more limited meaning. Ps. 21:4, where the phrase is followed by "forever and ever," may be an exception, though the juxtaposition of the phrases may be an example of intensification, where the second phrase goes beyond the limits of the first, rather than synonymity. Even if one takes both expressions as referring to eternal life, the language is part of the king's hyperbolic description of the LORD's blessings and should not be taken literally.<br>
 <a name="fn887" href="psa.htm#fnB887"><sup>21</sup></a><b>sn</b> (23:6)  <i>Psalm 24</i>. The psalmist affirms the universal kingship of the sovereign creator, reminds his people that only the morally pure are qualified to worship him, and celebrates his splendor as a mighty warrior king.<br>
 <a name="fn888" href="psa.htm#fnB888"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:2)  The prefixed verbal form is understood as a preterite, referring to the creation of the world.<br>
 <a name="fn889" href="psa.htm#fnB889"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (24:2)  <i>He...established it upon the ocean currents</i>. The description reflects ancient Israelite pre-scientific cosmology, which is based on outward appearances. The language also suggests that God's creative work involved the subjugation of chaos, symbolized by the sea.<br>
 <a name="fn890" href="psa.htm#fnB890"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:3)  The imperfects in v. 3 are modal, expressing potential or permission.<br>
 <a name="fn891" href="psa.htm#fnB891"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (24:3)  In this context the Lord's <i>mountain</i> probably refers to Zion/Jerusalem (see Isa 2:2-3).<br>
 <a name="fn892" href="psa.htm#fnB892"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:4)  <i>Heb</i> "the innocent of hands and the pure of heart." The "hands" allude to one's actions, the "heart" to one's thought life and motives.<br>
 <a name="fn893" href="psa.htm#fnB893"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:4)  <i>Heb</i> "who does not lift up for emptiness my life." The first person pronoun on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yvpn</FONT>, "my life," makes little sense here; many medieval Hebrew MSS support the ancient versions in reading a third person pronoun "his." The idiom "lift the life" here means to "long for" or "desire strongly" (see <i>HALOT</i> 725). In this context (note the reference to an oath in the following line) "emptiness" probably refers to speech (see Ps 12:2).<br>
 <a name="fn894" href="psa.htm#fnB894"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:4)  <i>Heb</i> "and does not swear an oath deceitfully."<br>
 <a name="fn895" href="psa.htm#fnB895"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:5)  <i>Heb</i> "he (the righteous individual described in v. 4) lifts up a blessing from the LORD." The singular subject is representative here, as v. 6 makes clear. The referent (godly people like the individual in v. 4) has been specified in the translation for clarity. The imperfect verbal form is generalizing; such people are typically rewarded for their deeds.<br>
 <a name="fn896" href="psa.htm#fnB896"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:5)  "and vindication from the God of his deliverance."<br>
 <a name="fn897" href="psa.htm#fnB897"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:6)  <i>Heb</i> "this [is the] generation of the ones seeking him, the ones seeking your face, Jacob." To "seek the LORD's face" means to seek his favor through prayer (see 2 Sam 21:1; Pss 27:8; 105:4).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (24:6)  This verse presents a somewhat idealized view of <i>Jacob</i>'<i>s descendants</i> as devoted worshipers of the Lord.<br>
 <a name="fn898" href="psa.htm#fnB898"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:7)  <i>Heb</i> "lift up your heads." The gates of the Lord's dwelling place are here personified. The idiom "lift up the head" often means "be confident, bold" (see Judg 8:28; Job 10:15; Ps 83:2; Zech 1:21).<br>

 <a name="fn904" href="psa.htm#fnB904"><sup>17</sup></a><b>sn</b> (24:10)  <i>Psalm 25</i>. The psalmist asks for divine protection, guidance and forgiveness as he affirms his loyalty to and trust in the Lord. This psalm is an acrostic; every verse begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet, except for v. 18, which, like v. 19, begins with <i>resh</i> instead of the expected <i>qof</i>. The final verse, which begins with <i>pe</i>, stands outside the acrostic scheme.<br>
 <a name="fn905" href="psa.htm#fnB905"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:1)  <i>Heb</i> "to you, O LORD, my life I lift up." To "lift up" one's "life" to the LORD means to express one's trust in him through prayer. See Pss 86:4; 143:8.<br>
 <a name="fn906" href="psa.htm#fnB906"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:3)  <i>Heb</i> "those who deal in treachery in vain."

In this hymn of praise the psalmist calls upon the heavenly assembly to acknowledge the royal splendor of the Lord. He describes the Lord's devastating power as revealed in the thunderstorm and affirms that the Lord exerts this awesome might on behalf of his people. In its original context the psalm was a bold polemic against the Canaanite storm god Baal, for it affirms that the Lord is the real king who controls the elements of the storm, contrary to pagan belief. See R. B. Chisholm, Jr., "The Polemic against Baalism in Israel's Early History and Literature," <i>BSac</i> 150 (1994): 280-82.<br>

In this case one may read "God." Some, following a Qumran text and the LXX, also propose the phrase occurred in the original text of Deut 32:8.<br>
 <b>tn</b> (29:1)  The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yla ynb</FONT> ("sons of gods" or "sons of God") occurs only here and in Ps 89:7. In Ps 89 the "sons of gods/God" are also called "the assembly of the holy ones" and "council of the holy ones." The heavenly assembly, comprised of so-called "angels" and other supernatural<i> </i>beings, appears to be in view. See Job 5:1; 15:15 and Zech 14:5, where these supernatural beings are referred to as "holy ones." In Canaanite mythological texts the divine council of the high god El is referred to as "the sons of El." The OT apparently borrows the Canaanite phrase and applies it to the supernatural beings that surround the heavenly throne.<br>

 <a name="fn1033" href="psa.htm#fnB1033"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:3)  The Hebrew perfect verbal form is probably descriptive. In dramatic fashion the psalmist portrays the LORD coming in the storm to do battle with his enemies and to vindicate his people.<br>

The geographical references in the psalm (Lebanon, Sirion, Kadesh) suggest this is a reference to the Mediterranean Sea (see Ezek 26:19; 27:26). The psalmist describes a powerful storm moving in from the sea and sweeping over the mountainous areas north of Israel. The "surging waters" may symbolize the hostile enemies of God who seek to destroy his people (see Pss 18:17; 32:6; 77:20; 93:4; 144:7; Isa 17:13; Jer 51:55; Ezek 26:19; Hab 3:15).

The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rbv</FONT> appears in the Qal in the first line of the verse, and in the Piel in the second line. The verb, which means "break" in the Qal, appears thirty-six times in the Piel, always with multiple objects (the object is either a collective singular or grammatically plural or dual form). The Piel may highlight the repetition of the pluralative action, or it may suggest an intensification of action, indicating repeated action comprising a whole, perhaps with the nuance "break again and again, break in pieces." Another option is to understand the form as resultative, "make broken" (see <i>IBHS</i> 405).<br>

 <a name="fn1042" href="psa.htm#fnB1042"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:7)  The verb normally means "to hew [stone or wood]," or "to hew out." In Hos 6:5 it seems to mean "cut in pieces," "knock down," or perhaps "hack" (see Andersen and Freedman, <i>Hosea</i>, 428). The Ugaritic cognate can mean "assault." In v. 7 the verb seems to have a similar meaning, perhaps "attack, strike." The phrase "flames of fire" is an adverbial accusative; the LORD's shout is accompanied by "flames of fire," that is, lightning bolts.<br>
 <a name="fn1043" href="psa.htm#fnB1043"><sup>16</sup></a><b>sn</b> (29:7)  <i>The </i>LORD<i>'s shout strikes with flaming fire</i>. The short line has invited textual emendation, but its distinct, brief form may highlight the statement, which serves as the axis of a chiastic structure encompassing vv. 5-9: (A) the Lord's shout destroys the forest (v. 5); (B) the Lord's shout shakes the terrain (v. 6); (C) the Lord's shout is accompanied by destructive lightning (v. 7); (B&#180;) the Lord's shout shakes the terrain (v. 8); (A&#180;) the Lord's shout destroys the forest (v. 9).<br>

The presence of the article (perhaps indicating uniqueness) and the switch to the perfect verbal form (which could be taken as describing a past situation) might support this. However, the immediate context indicates that the referent of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lwbm</FONT> is the "surging waters" mentioned in v. 3. The article indicates waters that are definite in the mind of the speaker and the perfect is probably descriptive in function, like "thunders" in v. 3. However, even though the historical flood is not the primary referent here, there may be a literary allusion involved. The psalmist views the threatening chaotic sea as a contemporary manifestation of the destructive waters of old.<br>

 <a name="fn1091" href="psa.htm#fnB1091"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:5)  Or "redeem." The perfect verbal form is understood here as anticipatory, indicating rhetorically the psalmist's certitude and confidence that God will intervene. The psalmist is so confident of God's positive response to his prayer that he can describe his deliverance as if it had already happened. Another option is to take the perfect as precative, expressing a wish or request ("rescue me"; cf. NIV). See <i>IBHS</i> 494-95. However, not all grammarians are convinced that the perfect is used as a precative in biblical Hebrew.<br>

Apparently the verb in the previous line ("grow dim, be weakened") is to be understood here.

The resulting form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">da</FONT> can then be taken as a defectively written form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dya</FONT> ("calamity"). If one follows this emendation, then the text reads literally, "and to my neighbors [I am one who experiences] calamity." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">djp</FONT> ("[object of] horror") occurs in the next line; <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dya</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">djp</FONT> appear in parallelism elsewhere (see Prov 1:26-27).<br>

Seeking his protection presupposes and even demonstrates the subject's loyalty to the LORD. In the psalms those who "take shelter" in the LORD are contrasted with the wicked and equated with those who love, fear, and serve the LORD (Pss 2:12; 5:11-12; 34:21-22).<br>

The psalmist recalls the agony he experienced prior to confessing his sins and affirms that true happiness comes when one's sins are forgiven. He then urges others not to be stubborn, but to turn to God while forgiveness is available, for God extends his mercy to the repentant, while the wicked experience nothing but sorrow.<br>

The word is derived from a verb meaning "to be prudent; to be wise" (see BDB 968). Various options are: "a contemplative song," "a song imparting moral wisdom," or "a skillful [i.e., well-written] song."  The term occurs in the superscriptions of Pss 32, 42, 44, 45, 52-55, 74, 78, 88, 89, and 142, as well as in Ps 47:7.<br>
 <a name="fn1129" href="psa.htm#fnB1129"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:1)  The Hebrew noun is an abstract plural. The word often refers metonymically to the happiness that God-given security and prosperity produce (see Pss 1:1, 3; 2:12; 34:9; 41:1; 65:4; 84:12; 89:15; 106:3; 112:1; 127:5; 128:1; 144:15).

 <a name="fn1133" href="psa.htm#fnB1133"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:2)  <i>Heb</i> "happy [is] the man to whom the LORD does not impute wrongdoing."<br>

In this context, which focuses on confession and forgiveness of sin, the psalmist refers to one who refuses to deny or hide his sin, but instead honestly confesses it to God.<br>
 <a name="fn1135" href="psa.htm#fnB1135"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:3)  <i>Heb</i> "when I was silent."<br>

 <a name="fn1138" href="psa.htm#fnB1138"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tc</b> (32:4)  <i>Heb</i> "my [?] was turned." The meaning of the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dvl</FONT> is uncertain. A noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dv*l*</FONT> ("cake") is attested in Num 11:8, but it would make no sense to understand that word in this context. It is better to emend the form to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yD]v%l=</FONT> ("to my destruction") and understand "your hand" as the subject of the verb "was turned." In this case the text reads, "[your hand] was turned to my destruction." In Lam 3:3 the author laments that God's "hand" was "turned" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">iph</FONT>) against him in a hostile sense.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (32:4)  <i>You tried to destroy me</i>. The psalmist's statement reflects his perspective. As far as he was concerned, it seemed as if the Lord was trying to kill him.<br>
 <a name="fn1139" href="psa.htm#fnB1139"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:4)  The translation assumes that the plural form indicates degree. If one understands the form as a true plural, then one might translate, "in the times of drought."<br>

Perhaps the psalmist suffered during the hot season and perceived the very weather as being an instrument of divine judgment. Another option is that he compares his time of suffering to the uncomfortable and oppressive heat of summer.<br>
 <a name="fn1141" href="psa.htm#fnB1141"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:5)  The Hiphil of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hdy</FONT> normally means "give thanks, praise," but here, as in Prov 28:13, it means "confess."<br>
 <a name="fn1142" href="psa.htm#fnB1142"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:5)  <i>Heb</i> "the wrongdoing of my sin." By joining synonyms for "sin" in this way, the psalmist may be emphasizing the degree of his wrongdoing.<br>

The psalmist here refers to himself, as the parallel line ("You will not abandon me to Sheol") indicates.<br>
 <a name="fn1144" href="psa.htm#fnB1144"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:6)  <i>Heb</i> "at a time of finding." This may mean, "while there is time to `find' [the LORD]" and seek his forgiveness (cf.

 <a name="fn1149" href="psa.htm#fnB1149"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:8)  The second person pronominal forms in this verse are singular. The psalmist addresses each member of his audience individually (see also the note on the word "eye" in the next line). A less likely option (but one which is commonly understood) is that the LORD addresses the psalmist in vv. 8-9 (cf.

In 2 Chr 20:12 the statement "our eye is upon you" means that the speakers are looking to the LORD for intervention. Here the expression "my eye upon you" may simply mean that the psalmist will teach his pupils directly and personally.<br>
 <a name="fn1152" href="psa.htm#fnB1152"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:9)  The verb form is plural (i.e., "do not all of you be"); the psalmist addresses the whole group.<br>

The meaning of the Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ydu</FONT> is uncertain. Normally the word refers to "jewelry," so some suggest the meaning "trappings" here (cf. NASB). Some emend the form to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;hyjl</FONT> ("their jawbones") but it difficult to see how the present Hebrew text, even if corrupt, could have derived from this proposed original reading. P. C. Craigie (<i>Psalms 1-50</i>, 265) takes the form from an Arabic root and translates "whose gallop."  Cf. also NRSV "whose temper must be curbed."<br>
 <a name="fn1155" href="psa.htm#fnB1155"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:10)  <i>Heb</i> "many [are the] pains of evil [one]." The singular form is representative here; the typical evildoer, representative of the larger group of wicked people, is in view.<br>

The "pure of heart" are God's faithful followers who trust in and love the LORD and, as a result, experience his deliverance (see Pss 7:10; 11:2; 36:10; 64:10; 94:15; 97:11).<br>
 <a name="fn1158" href="psa.htm#fnB1158"><sup>30</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:11)  <i>Psalm 33</i>. In this hymn the psalmist praises the Lord as the sovereign creator and just ruler of the world who protects and vindicates those who fear him.<br>

The words "were created" are added in the translation for stylistic reasons; they are understood by ellipsis (note "were made" in the preceding line).

This verse appears to refer to Gen 1:9, where God decrees that the watery deep be gathered to one place so that dry land might appear. If so, the participles in this and the following line depict this action with special vividness, as if the reader were present on the occasion.

 <a name="fn1192" href="psa.htm#fnB1192"><sup>34</sup></a><b>sn</b> (33:22)  <i>Psalm 34</i>. In this song of thanksgiving the psalmist praises God for delivering him from distress. He encourages others to be loyal to the Lord, tells them how to please God, and assures them that the Lord protects his servants. The psalm is an acrostic; vv. 1-21 begin with successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet. (Verse 6 begins with the letter <i>he</i> and v. 7 with the letter <i>zayin</i>. The letter <i>vav</i>, which comes between <i>he</i> and <i>zayin</i>, seems to be omitted, although it does appear at the beginning of v. 6b. The final verse of the psalm, which begins with the letter <i>pe</i>, is outside the acrostic scheme.)<br>

 <b>sn</b> (33:22)  <i>Pretended to be insane</i>. The psalm heading appears to refer to the account in 1 Sam 21:10-15 which tells how David, fearful that King Achish of Gath might kill him, pretended to be insane in hopes that the king would simply send him away. The psalm heading names the king Abimelech, not Achish, suggesting that the tradition is confused on this point. However, perhaps "Abimelech" was a royal title, rather than a proper name. See P. C. Craigie, <i>Psalms 1-50</i>, 278.<br>

 <a name="fn1197" href="psa.htm#fnB1197"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:2)  The two prefixed verbal forms in this verse are best taken as jussives, for the psalmist is calling his audience to worship (see v. 3).<br>

The third person plural subject ("they") is unidentified; there is no antecedent in the Hebrew text. For this reason some prefer to take the perfect verbal forms in the first line as imperatives, "look to him and be radiant" (cf. NEB, NRSV). Some medieval Hebrew MSS and other ancient witnesses (Aquila, the Syriac, and Jerome) support an imperatival reading for the first verb. In the second line some (with support from the LXX and Syriac) change "their faces" to "your faces," which allows one to retain more easily the jussive force of the verb (suggested by the preceding <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la^</FONT>), "do not let your faces be ashamed." It is probable that the verbal construction in the second line is rhetorical, expressing the conviction that the action in view cannot or should not happen. See GKC &#167;109.<i>e</i> and BDB 39.<br>

 <a name="fn1208" href="psa.htm#fnB1208"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:8)  "Taking shelter" in the LORD is an idiom for seeking his protection. Seeking his protection presupposes and even demonstrates the subject's loyalty to the LORD. In the psalms those who "take shelter" in the LORD are contrasted with the wicked and equated with those who love, fear, and serve the LORD (Pss 2:12; 5:11-12; 31:17-20; 34:21-22).<br>

The author of the Gospel of John saw a fulfillment of these words in Jesus' experience on the cross (see John 19:31-37), for the Roman soldiers, when they saw that Jesus was already dead, did not break his legs as was customarily done to speed the death of crucified individuals. John's use of the psalm seems strange, for the statement in its original context suggests that the Lord protects the godly from physical harm. Jesus' legs may have remained unbroken, but he was brutally and unjustly executed by his enemies. John seems to give the statement a literal sense that is foreign to its original literary context by applying a promise of divine protection to a man who was seemingly not saved by God. However, John saw in this incident a foreshadowing of Jesus' ultimate deliverance and vindication. His unbroken bones were a reminder of God's commitment to the godly and a sign of things to come. Jesus' death on the cross was not the end of the story; God vindicated him, as John goes on to explain in the following context (John 19:38-20:18).<br>

Many modern translations render the first term (translated here "small shield") as "buckler" (cf.

The English term "buckler," referring to a small round shield held on the arm to protect the upper body, is unfamiliar to many modern readers, so the term "small shield" was used in the present translation for clarity.<br>

It appears that the words "pit" and "net" have been transposed.

 <a name="fn1248" href="psa.htm#fnB1248"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:8)  <i>Heb</i> "let destruction [which] he does not know come to him." The singular is used of the enemy in v. 8, probably in a representative or collective sense. The psalmist has more than one enemy, as vv. 1-7 make clear.<br>

Perhaps the form should be read as a Qal active participle, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yk!n{</FONT> ("ones who strike") from the verbal root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkn</FONT> ("to strike"). The Qal of this verb is unattested in biblical Hebrew, but the <i>peal</i> (basic) stem appears in Old Aramaic (see <i>KAI</i> 224:12-13, as well as J. Fitzmyer, <i>The Aramaic Inscriptions of Sefire</i>, 114, and <i>DNWSI</i>, 730.) In this case one might translate, "attackers gathered together against me though I was not aware of it" (cf. NASB "smiters"; NEB, NRSV "ruffians"; NIV "attackers").<br>
 <a name="fn1266" href="psa.htm#fnB1266"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:15)  <i>Heb</i> "they tore and did not keep quiet." By using the verb "tear," the psalmist likens his enemies to a wild animal (see Hos 13:8). In v. 17 he compares them to hungry young lions.<br>
 <a name="fn1267" href="psa.htm#fnB1267"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tc</b> (35:16)  The MT reads "as profane [ones] of mockers of food," which is nonsensical.

 <a name="fn1272" href="psa.htm#fnB1272"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:17)  <i>Heb</i> "my only one." The psalmist may mean that his life is precious, or that he feels isolated and alone (see Ps 22:20). The verb "guard" is supplied in the translation, because the verb "rescue" is understood by ellipsis (see the previous line).<br>
 <a name="fn1273" href="psa.htm#fnB1273"><sup>37</sup></a><b>sn</b> (35:18)  The <i>great assembly </i>is also mentioned in Ps 22:25.<br>

The negative particle is understood in the second line by ellipsis (see the preceding line). In the Book of Proverbs "winking an eye" is associated with deceit and trickery (see 6:13; 10:10; 16:30).<br>

 <a name="fn1281" href="psa.htm#fnB1281"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:21)  <i>Heb</i> "our eye sees." Apparently this is an idiom meaning to "look in triumph" or "gloat over" (see Ps 54:7).<br>
 <a name="fn1282" href="psa.htm#fnB1282"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:22)  <i>Heb</i> "you see, O LORD." There is a deliberate play on words. In v. 21 the enemies say, "our eye sees," but the psalmist is confident that the LORD "sees" as well, so he appeals to him for help (see also v. 17).<br>

The prefixed verbal forms in v. 26 are understood as jussives (see vv. 24b-25, where the negative particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la</FONT> appears before the prefixed verbal forms, indicating they are jussives). The psalmist is calling down judgment on his enemies.<br>

 <a name="fn1296" href="psa.htm#fnB1296"><sup>60</sup></a><b>sn</b> (35:28)  <i>Psalm 36</i>. Though evil men plan to harm others, the psalmist is confident that the Lord is the just ruler of the earth who gives and sustains all life. He prays for divine blessing and protection and anticipates God's judgment of the wicked.<br>
 <a name="fn1297" href="psa.htm#fnB1297"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:28)  In the Hebrew text the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;an</FONT> ("oracle") appears at the beginning of the next verse (v. 2 in the Hebrew text because the superscription is considered v. 1). The resulting reading, "an oracle of rebellion for the wicked [is] in the midst of my heart" (cf. NIV) apparently means that the psalm, which foresees the downfall of the wicked, is a prophetic oracle about the rebellion of the wicked which emerges from the soul of the psalmist. One could translate, "Here is a poem written as I reflected on the rebellious character of evil men." Another option, followed in the translation above, is to attach <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;an</FONT> ("oracle") with the superscription. For another example of a Davidic poem being labeled an "oracle," see 2 Sam 23:1.<br>
 <a name="fn1298" href="psa.htm#fnB1298"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:1)  <i>Heb</i> "[the] rebellion of an evil man [is] in the midst of my heart." The translation assumes a reading "in the midst of his heart" (i.e., "to the core") instead of "in the midst of my heart," a change which finds support in a a few medieval Hebrew MSS, the Hebrew text of Origen's Hexapla, and the Syriac.<br>
 <a name="fn1299" href="psa.htm#fnB1299"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:1)  <i>Heb</i> "there is no dread of God before his eyes." The phrase "dread of God" refers here to a healthy respect for God which recognizes that he will punish evil behavior.<br>
 <a name="fn1300" href="psa.htm#fnB1300"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:2)  <i>Heb</i> "for it causes to be smooth to him in his eyes to find his sin to hate." The meaning of the Hebrew text is unclear. Perhaps the point is this: His rebellious attitude makes him reject any notion that God will hold him accountable. His attitude also prevents him from recognizing and repudiating his sinful ways.<br>
 <a name="fn1301" href="psa.htm#fnB1301"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:3)  <i>Heb</i> "he ceases to exhibit wisdom to do good." The Hiphil forms are exhibitive, indicating the outward expression of an inner attitude.<br>

The psalmist uses a legal metaphor to describe God's preservation of his creation. Like a just judge who vindicates the innocent, God protects his creation from destructive forces.<br>

 <a name="fn1313" href="psa.htm#fnB1313"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:10)  <i>Heb</i> "to those who know you." The Hebrew verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">udy</FONT> ("know") is used here of those who "know" the LORD in the sense that they recognize his royal authority and obey his will (see Jer 22:16).<br>
 <a name="fn1314" href="psa.htm#fnB1314"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:10)  <i>Heb</i> "and your justice to." The verb "extend" is understood by ellipsis in the second line (see the previous line).<br>
 <a name="fn1315" href="psa.htm#fnB1315"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:10)  <i>Heb</i> "the pure of heart." The "heart" is here viewed as the seat of one's moral character and motives. The "pure of heart" are God's faithful followers who trust in and love the Lord and, as a result, experience his deliverance (see Pss 7:10; 11:2; 32:11; 64:10; 94:15; 97:11).<br>

The adverb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v</FONT> ("there") is used here for dramatic effect, as the psalmist envisions the evildoers lying fallen at a spot that is this vivid in his imagination (see BDB 1027).<br>
 <a name="fn1318" href="psa.htm#fnB1318"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:12)  The psalmist uses perfect verbal forms in v. 12 to describe the demise of the wicked as if it has already taken place.<br>

When the smoke of judgment clears, the wicked will be gone, but the godly will remain and inherit God's promised blessings. The psalm is an acrostic; every other verse begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.<br>
 <a name="fn1320" href="psa.htm#fnB1320"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:1)  The verb form is singular (see vv. 3-10 as well, where the second person verbs and pronouns are also singular). The psalmist's exhortation has a wisdom flavor to it; it is personalized for each member of his audience.<br>

The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hur</FONT> ("tend, shepherd") is probably used here in the sense of "watch over, guard." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnwma</FONT> ("faithfulness, honesty, integrity") is understood as the direct object of the verb, though it could be taken as an adverbial accusative, "[feed] securely," if the audience is likened to a flock of sheep.<br>
 <a name="fn1324" href="psa.htm#fnB1324"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:4)  Following the imperatives of v. 3 the prefixed verbal forms with <i>vav</i> in v. 4 indicate result. Faith and obedience (v. 3) will bring divine blessing (v. 4).<br>

The text should be changed to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lj@otw+</FONT> (Hiphil of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ljy</FONT>, "wait"; see <i>HALOT</i> 311). It appears that the Hebrew text is the product of dittography: (1) the initial <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hw</FONT> is accidentally repeated from the preceding word (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwhy</FONT>) and (2) the final <i>lamed</i> is accidentally repeated (note the preceding <i>lamed</i> and the initial <i>lamed</i> on the following form, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wl</FONT>).<br>

The present translation follows a reading in the Dead Sea Scrolls (4QpPs37), <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;rwk dwqyk</FONT> ("like the burning of an oven"; see <i>HALOT</i> 496). The next line, which pictures the LORD's enemies being consumed in smoke, supports this reading, which assumes confusion of the Hebrew letters <i>resh</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">r</FONT>) and <i>dalet</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">d</FONT>) at the end of the first word in the sequence.<br>
 <a name="fn1355" href="psa.htm#fnB1355"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:20)  <i>Heb</i> "they perish in smoke, they perish." In addition to repeating the verb for emphasis, the psalmist uses the perfect form of the verb to picture the enemies' demise as if it had already taken place. In this way he draws attention to the certitude of their judgment.<br>
 <a name="fn1356" href="psa.htm#fnB1356"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:21)  <i>Heb</i> "an evil [man] borrows and does not repay; but a godly [man] is gracious and gives." The singular forms are used in a representative sense; the typical evildoer and godly individual are in view. The three active participles and one imperfect ("repay") draw attention to the characteristic behavior of the two types.<br>
 <a name="fn1357" href="psa.htm#fnB1357"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:22)  The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk</FONT> is best understood as asseverative or emphatic here.<br>
 <a name="fn1358" href="psa.htm#fnB1358"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:22)  <i>Heb</i> "those blessed by him." The pronoun "him" must refer to the Lord (see vv. 20, 23), so the referent has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>

 <a name="fn1360" href="psa.htm#fnB1360"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:22)  Or "cut off"; or "removed" (see v. 9).<br>
 <a name="fn1361" href="psa.htm#fnB1361"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:23)  <i>Heb</i> "from the LORD the steps of a man are established, and in his way he delights." The second line qualifies the first. The man whose behavior is commendable in God's sight is the one whose ways are established by God. Another option is that the second line refers to the godly man delighting in God's "way," namely the lifestyle which he prescribes for men. In this case one might translate, "The LORD grants success to the one who desires to obey his commands."<br>
 <a name="fn1362" href="psa.htm#fnB1362"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:24)  Other translation options for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk</FONT> in this context are "when" (so NASB) or "though" (so NEB, NIV, NRSV).<br>
 <a name="fn1363" href="psa.htm#fnB1363"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:24)  <i>Heb</i> "be hurled down."<br>
 <a name="fn1364" href="psa.htm#fnB1364"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:24)  The active participle indicates this is characteristically true. See v. 17.<br>

The expression "search for food" also appears in Lam 1:11, where Jerusalem's refugees are forced to search for food and to trade their valuable possessions for something to eat.<br>
 <a name="fn1367" href="psa.htm#fnB1367"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:26)  The active participles describe characteristic behavior.<br>

 <a name="fn1370" href="psa.htm#fnB1370"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:27)  <i>Heb</i> "and dwell permanently." The imperative with <i>vav</i> is best taken here as a result clause after the preceding imperatives.<br>
 <a name="fn1371" href="psa.htm#fnB1371"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:28)  <i>Heb</i> "loves." The verb "loves" is here metonymic; the LORD's commitment to principles of justice causes him to actively promote these principles as he governs the world. The active participle describes characteristic behavior.<br>
 <a name="fn1372" href="psa.htm#fnB1372"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:28)  The imperfect verbal form draws attention to this generalizing statement.<br>

 <a name="fn1374" href="psa.htm#fnB1374"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:28)  Or "offspring"; <i>Heb </i>"seed."<br>
 <a name="fn1375" href="psa.htm#fnB1375"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:28)  Or "cut off"; or "removed." The perfect verbal forms in v. 28b state general truths.<br>
 <a name="fn1376" href="psa.htm#fnB1376"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:30)  <i>Heb</i> "The mouth of the godly [one] utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice." The singular form is used in a representative sense; the typical godly individual is in view. The imperfect verbal forms draw attention to the characteristic behavior of the godly.<br>
 <a name="fn1377" href="psa.htm#fnB1377"><sup>58</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:31)  <i>Heb</i> "the law of his God [is] in his heart." The "heart" is here the seat of one's thoughts and motives.<br>
 <a name="fn1378" href="psa.htm#fnB1378"><sup>59</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:31)  <i>Heb</i> "his." The pronoun has been translated as plural to agree with the representative or typical "godly" in v. 30.<br>
 <a name="fn1379" href="psa.htm#fnB1379"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:32)  <i>Heb</i> "an evil [one] watches the godly [one] and seeks to kill him." The singular forms are used in a representative sense; the typical evildoer and godly individual are in view. The active participles describe characteristic behavior.<br>
 <a name="fn1380" href="psa.htm#fnB1380"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:33)  <i>Heb</i> "the LORD does not abandon him into his hand or condemn him when he is judged." The imperfects draw attention to the LORD's characteristic behavior in this regard.<br>

 <a name="fn1382" href="psa.htm#fnB1382"><sup>63</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:34)  <i>Heb</i> "keep his way." The LORD's "way" refers here to the "conduct required" by the LORD. In Ps 25 the LORD's "ways" are associated with his covenantal demands (see vv. 4, 9-10). See also Ps 119:3 (cf. vv. 1, 4), as well as Deut 8:6; 10:12; 11:22; 19:9; 26:17; 28:9; 30:16.<br>
 <a name="fn1383" href="psa.htm#fnB1383"><sup>64</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:34)  <i>Heb</i> "and he will lift you up." The prefixed verbal form with <i>vav</i> is best taken here as a result clause following the imperatives in the preceding lines.<br>

 <a name="fn1385" href="psa.htm#fnB1385"><sup>66</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:35)  The Hebrew uses the representative singular again here.<br>
 <a name="fn1386" href="psa.htm#fnB1386"><sup>67</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:35)  <i>Heb</i> "being exposed [?] like a native, luxuriant." The Hebrew form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrutm</FONT> appears to be a Hitpael participle from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hru</FONT> ("be exposed"), but this makes no sense in this context. Perhaps the form is a dialectal variant of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlutm</FONT> ("giving oneself an air of importance"; see Jer 51:3 and <i>HALOT</i> 830), from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlu</FONT> ("go up"; see P. C. Craigie, <i>Psalms 1-50</i>, 296). The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jrza</FONT> ("native, full citizen") refers elsewhere to people, but here, where it is collocated with "luxuriant, green," it probably refers to a tree growing in native soil.<br>
 <a name="fn1387" href="psa.htm#fnB1387"><sup>68</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:36)  <i>Heb</i> "and he passes by and, look, he is not [there]." The subject of the verb "passes by" is probably indefinite, referring to any passerby. Some prefer to change the form to first person, "and I passed by" (cf. NEB; note the first person verbal forms in preceding verse and in the following line).<br>
 <a name="fn1388" href="psa.htm#fnB1388"><sup>69</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:37)  Or "upright."<br>
 <a name="fn1389" href="psa.htm#fnB1389"><sup>70</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:37)  <i>Heb</i> "for [there is] an end for a man of peace." Some interpret <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tyrja</FONT> ("end") as referring to offspring (see the next verse and Ps 109:13; cf. NEB, NRSV).<br>
 <a name="fn1390" href="psa.htm#fnB1390"><sup>71</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:38)  Or "destroyed together." In this case the psalmist pictures judgment sweeping them away as a group.<br>
 <a name="fn1391" href="psa.htm#fnB1391"><sup>72</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:38)  <i>Heb</i> "the end of evil men is cut off." As in v. 37, some interpret <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tyrja</FONT> ("end") as referring to offspring (see Ps 109:13). The perfect verbal forms in v. 38 probably express general truths. Another option is that they are used emphatically to state with certitude that the demise of the wicked is as good as done.<br>
 <a name="fn1392" href="psa.htm#fnB1392"><sup>73</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:39)  <i>Heb</i> "and the deliverance of the godly [ones] [is] from the LORD."<br>

 <a name="fn1394" href="psa.htm#fnB1394"><sup>75</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:40)  The prefixed verbal forms with <i>vav</i> consecutive carry on the generalizing tone of the preceding verse.<br>
 <a name="fn1395" href="psa.htm#fnB1395"><sup>76</sup></a><b>sn</b> (37:40)  <i>Psalm 38</i>. The author asks the Lord to deliver him from his enemies. He confesses his sin and recognizes that the crisis he faces is the result of divine discipline. Yet he begs the Lord not to reject him.<br>
 <a name="fn1396" href="psa.htm#fnB1396"><sup>77</sup></a><b>tn</b> (37:40)  The Hebrew text reads simply, "to cause to remember." The same form, the Hiphil infinitive of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rkz</FONT> ("remember"), also appears in the heading of Ps 70. Some understand this in the sense of "for the memorial offering," but it may carry the idea of bringing one's plight to God's attention (see P. C. Craigie, <i>Psalms 1-50</i>, 303).<br>
 <a name="fn1397" href="psa.htm#fnB1397"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (38:1)  The words "continue to" are supplied in the translation of both lines. The following verses make it clear that the psalmist is already experiencing divine rebuke/punishment. He asks that it might cease.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (38:1)  Compare Ps 38:1 with Ps 6:1, which has similar wording.<br>
 <a name="fn1398" href="psa.htm#fnB1398"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (38:2)  The verb Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tjn</FONT> apparently here means "penetrate, pierce" (see <i>HALOT</i> 692; note as well the use of the Qal in Prov 17:10). The psalmist pictures the LORD as a warrior who shoots arrows at him (see Ps 7:12-13).<br>
 <a name="fn1399" href="psa.htm#fnB1399"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (38:2)  <i>Heb</i> "and your hand [?] upon me." The meaning of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tjn</FONT> is unclear in this context. It is preferable to emend the form to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jntw</FONT>, from the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jwn</FONT> ("rest"). In this case the text would read literally, "and your hand rests upon me" (see Isa 25:10, though the phrase is used in a positive sense there, unlike Ps 38:2).<br>
 <a name="fn1400" href="psa.htm#fnB1400"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (38:3)  <i>Heb</i> "there is no soundness in my flesh from before your anger." "Anger" here refers metonymically to divine judgment, which is the practical effect of God's anger at the psalmist's sin.<br>
 <a name="fn1401" href="psa.htm#fnB1401"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (38:3)  <i>Heb</i> "there is no health in my bones from before my sin."<br>

 <a name="fn1403" href="psa.htm#fnB1403"><sup>7</sup></a><b>sn</b> (38:5)  The reference to <i>wounds</i> may be an extension of the metaphorical language of v. 2. The psalmist pictures himself as one whose flesh is ripped and torn by arrows.<br>

 <a name="fn1406" href="psa.htm#fnB1406"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (38:6)  The verb's precise shade of meaning in this context is not entirely clear. The verb, which literally means "to bend," may refer to the psalmist's posture. In Isa 21:3 it seems to mean "be confused, dazed."<br>
 <a name="fn1407" href="psa.htm#fnB1407"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (38:6)  <i>Heb</i> "I am bowed down to excess."<br>
 <a name="fn1408" href="psa.htm#fnB1408"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (38:7)  <i>Heb</i> "for my loins are filled with shame." The "loins" are viewed here as the seat of the psalmist's emotions. The present translation assumes that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlqn</FONT> is derived from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlq</FONT> ("be dishonored"). Some derive it instead from a homonymic root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlq</FONT>, meaning "to roast." In this case one might translate "fever" (cf. NEB "my loins burn with fever").<br>
 <a name="fn1409" href="psa.htm#fnB1409"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (38:7)  <i>Heb</i> "there is no soundness in my flesh" (see v. 3).<br>

 <a name="fn1414" href="psa.htm#fnB1414"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (38:11)  Or "wound," or "illness."<br>

 <a name="fn1418" href="psa.htm#fnB1418"><sup>22</sup></a><b>sn</b> (38:13)  <i>I am like a deaf man...like a mute</i>. The psalmist is like a deaf mute; he is incapable of defending himself and is vulnerable to his enemies' deception (see v. 14).<br>

 <a name="fn1432" href="psa.htm#fnB1432"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (39:1)  The psalmist wanted to voice a lament to the LORD (see vv. 4-6), but he hesitated to do so in the presence of evil men, for such words might be sinful if they gave the wicked an occasion to insult God.

The MT as it stands is syntactically awkward. The verb forms switch from singular ("walks about") to plural ("they strive") and then back to singular ("accumulates and does not know"), even though the subject (generic "man") remains the same. Furthermore there is no object for the verb "accumulates" and no plural antecedent for the plural pronoun ("them") attached to "gathers." These problems can be removed if one emends the text from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/wymhy lbh</FONT> ("[in] vain they strive") to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/wmh ylbh</FONT> ("vain things of wealth."

 <a name="fn1454" href="psa.htm#fnB1454"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (39:13)  <i>Heb</i> "Gaze away from me and I will smile before I go and am not." The precise identification of the initial verb form, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">uvh</FONT>, is uncertain. It could be from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">uuv</FONT> ("smear"), but "your eyes" would be the expected object in this case (see Isa 6:10). The verb may be an otherwise unattested Hiphil form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">huv</FONT> ("to gaze") meaning "cause your gaze to be." Some prefer to emend the form to the Qal <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">huv</FONT> ("gaze"; see Job 14:6). If one does read a form of the verb "to gaze," the angry divine "gaze" of discipline would seem to be in view (see vv. 10-11). For a similar expression of this sentiment see Job 10:20-21.<br>
 <a name="fn1455" href="psa.htm#fnB1455"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (39:13)  <i>Psalm 40</i>. The psalmist combines a song of thanksgiving for a recent act of divine deliverance (vv. 1-11) with a confident petition for renewed divine intervention (vv. 12-17).<br>
 <a name="fn1456" href="psa.htm#fnB1456"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:1)  <i>Heb</i> "relying, I relied." The infinitive absolute precedes the finite verbal form to emphasize the verbal idea. The emphasis is reflected in the translation through the adverb "completely." Another option is to translate, "I waited patiently" (cf. NASB, NIV, NRSV).<br>
 <a name="fn1457" href="psa.htm#fnB1457"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:2)  <i>Heb</i> "cistern of roaring." The Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rwb</FONT> ("cistern, pit") is used metaphorically here of Sheol, the place of death, which is sometimes depicted as a raging sea (see Ps 18:4, 15-16). The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/wav</FONT> ("roaring") refers elsewhere to the crashing sound of the sea's waves (see Ps 65:7).<br>
 <a name="fn1458" href="psa.htm#fnB1458"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:2)  <i>Heb</i> "from the mud of mud." The Hebrew phrase translated "slimy mud" employs an appositional genitive. Two synonyms are joined in a construct relationship to emphasize the single idea. For a detailed discussion of the grammatical point with numerous examples, see Y.

 <a name="fn1462" href="psa.htm#fnB1462"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:3)  <i>Heb</i> "may many see and fear and trust in the LORD." The translation assumes that the initial prefixed verbal form is a jussive ("may many see"), rather than an imperfect ("many will see"). The following prefixed verbal forms with <i>vav</i> conjunctive are taken as indicating purpose or result ("so that they might swear allegiance...and trust") after the introductory jussive.<br>
 <a name="fn1463" href="psa.htm#fnB1463"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:4)  The Hebrew noun is an abstract plural. The word often refers metonymically to the happiness that God-given security and prosperity produce (see Pss 1:1, 3; 2:12; 34:9; 41:1; 65:4; 84:12; 89:15; 106:3; 112:1; 127:5; 128:1; 144:15).<br>

The precise meaning of the text is not clear, but the psalmist seems to be recalling the Lord's miraculous deeds on Israel's behalf (see Pss 9:1; 26:7), as well as his covenantal decrees and promises (see Ps 33:11).<br>
 <a name="fn1469" href="psa.htm#fnB1469"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:5)  <i>Heb</i> "there is none arrayed against you." The precise meaning of the text is unclear, but the collocation <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la iru</FONT> ("array against") is used elsewhere of military (Judg 20:30; 1 Chr 19:17) or verbal opposition (Job 32:14).<br>
 <a name="fn1470" href="psa.htm#fnB1470"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:5)  <i>Heb</i> "I will declare and I will speak, they are too numerous to recount." The present translation assumes that the cohortatives are used in a hypothetical manner in a formally unmarked conditional sentence, "Should I try to declare [them] and speak [of them]..." (cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV). For other examples of cohortatives in the protasis ("if" clause) of a conditional sentence, see GKC &#167;108.<i>e</i>. (It should be noted, however, that <i>GKC</i> understands this particular verse in a different manner. See GKC &#167;108.<i>f</i>, where it is suggested that the cohortatives are part of an apodosis with the protasis being suppressed.) Another option is to take the cohortatives as a declaration of the psalmist's resolve to announce the truth expressed in the next line. In this case one might translate: "I will declare and speak [the truth]: They are too numerous to recount."<br>
 <a name="fn1471" href="psa.htm#fnB1471"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:6)  <i>Heb</i> "sacrifice and offering you do not desire." The statement is exaggerated for the sake of emphasis (see Ps 51:16 as well). God is pleased with sacrifices, but his first priority is obedience and loyalty (see 1 Sam 15:22). Sacrifices and offerings apart from genuine allegiance are meaningless (see Isa 1:11-20).<br>
 <a name="fn1472" href="psa.htm#fnB1472"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:6)  <i>Heb</i> "ears you hollowed out for me." The meaning of this odd expression (this is the only collocation of "hollowed out" and "ears" in the OT). It may have been an idiomatic expression referring to making a point clear to a listener. The LXX has "but a body you have prepared for me," a reading which is followed in Heb 10:5.<br>
 <a name="fn1473" href="psa.htm#fnB1473"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:7)  <i>Heb</i> "in the roll of the scroll it is written concerning me." Apparently the psalmist refers to the law of God (see v. 8), which contains the commandments God desires him to obey. If this is a distinctly royal psalm, then the psalmist/king may be referring specifically to the regulations of kingship prescribed in Deut 17:14-20. See P. C. Craigie, <i>Psalms 1-50</i>, 315.<br>
 <a name="fn1474" href="psa.htm#fnB1474"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:8)  Or "your will."<br>
 <a name="fn1475" href="psa.htm#fnB1475"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:8)  <i>Heb</i> "your law [is] in the midst of my inner parts." The "inner parts" are viewed here as the seat of the psalmist's thought life and moral decision making.<br>
 <a name="fn1476" href="psa.htm#fnB1476"><sup>21</sup></a><b>sn</b> (40:9)  The <i>great assembly</i> is also mentioned in Pss 22:25 and 35:18.<br>
 <a name="fn1477" href="psa.htm#fnB1477"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:9)  <i>Heb</i> "I proclaim justice in the great assembly." Though "justice" appears without a pronoun here, the LORD's just acts are in view (see v. 10). His "justice" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qdx</FONT>) is here the deliverance that originates in his justice; he protects and vindicates the one whose cause is just. For other examples of this use of the word, see BDB 841-42.<br>
 <a name="fn1478" href="psa.htm#fnB1478"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:9)  <i>Heb</i> "Look! My lips I do not restrain."<br>

 <a name="fn1481" href="psa.htm#fnB1481"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:11)  Some (cf. NIV, NRSV) translate the verb as a request ("do not withhold"), but elsewhere in the psalms the second masculine singular prefixed form, when addressed to God and preceded by <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">al</FONT>, is always indicative in mood and never has the force of a prayer (see Pss 16:10; 22:2; 44:9 51:16-17; 60:10; 108:11; cf. NEB, NASB).<br>
 <a name="fn1482" href="psa.htm#fnB1482"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:11)  In this line the psalmist makes the transition from confidence to petition (see v. 13). Since the prefixed verbal form in the preceding line is imperfect/indicative, one could take the verb in this line as imperfect as well and translate, "your loyal love and faithfulness continually protect me" (cf. NEB). However, the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk</FONT> at the beginning of the next verse, if causal ("because"), is best understood as introducing a motivating argument in support of a petition. For this reason v. 11b is best taken as a prayer with the prefixed form being understood as jussive (cf. NIV, NRSV). For parallels to the proposed construction (jussive followed by <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk</FONT> + perfect introducing motivating argument), see Ps 25:21, as well as Pss 10:2-3; 22:8.<br>
 <a name="fn1483" href="psa.htm#fnB1483"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:12)  Or "sinful deeds." The Hebrew term used here can have a non-moral nuance ("dangers") or a moral one ("sinful deeds") depending on the context. The next line (see "my sins") seems to favor the moral sense, but the psalmist also speaks of enemies shortly after this (v. 14).<br>
 <a name="fn1484" href="psa.htm#fnB1484"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:12)  <i>Heb</i> "and my heart abandons me." The "heart" is here viewed as the seat of emotional strength and courage. For a similar idea see Ps 38:10.<br>
 <a name="fn1485" href="psa.htm#fnB1485"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:13)  <i>Heb</i> "hurry to my help." See Pss 22:19; 38:22.<br>

 <a name="fn1487" href="psa.htm#fnB1487"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:14)  The four prefixed verbal forms in this verse ("may those...be...embarrassed and ashamed...may those...be turned back and ashamed") are understood as jussives. The psalmist is calling judgment down on his enemies.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (40:14)  See Ps 35:4 for a similar prayer.<br>
 <a name="fn1488" href="psa.htm#fnB1488"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:15)  The prefixed verbal form is understood as a jussive in this imprecation.<br>
 <a name="fn1489" href="psa.htm#fnB1489"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:15)  <i>Heb</i> "May they be humiliated according to their shame, those who say to me, `Aha! Aha!'"<br>
 <a name="fn1490" href="psa.htm#fnB1490"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:16)  <i>Heb</i> "those who love," which stands metonymically for its cause, the experience of being delivered by the LORD.<br>
 <a name="fn1491" href="psa.htm#fnB1491"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:16)  The three prefixed verbal forms prior to the quotation are understood as jussives. The psalmist balances out his imprecation against his enemies with a prayer of blessing upon the godly.<br>
 <a name="fn1492" href="psa.htm#fnB1492"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:16)  The prefixed verbal form is taken as a jussive, "may the LORD be magnified [in praise]." Another option is to take the verb as an imperfect, "the LORD is great" (cf. NRSV). See Ps 35:27.<br>
 <a name="fn1493" href="psa.htm#fnB1493"><sup>38</sup></a><b>sn</b> (40:17)  See Pss 35:10; 37:14.<br>
 <a name="fn1494" href="psa.htm#fnB1494"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (40:17)  The prefixed verbal form may be taken as a jussive of prayer (as in the present translation; cf. NIV) or as an imperfect, "The LORD will pay attention to me" (cf. NRSV). The parallel in Ps 70:5 has, "O God, hurry to me!" For this reason some prefer to emend <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bvjy</FONT> ("may he pay attention") to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hvwj</FONT> ("hurry!"). The syntax of the Hebrew text is awkward; elsewhere when the Qal of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bvj</FONT> ("reckon; consider") is collocated with the preposition -<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l</FONT> and a pronominal suffix there is an accompanying direct object or additional prepositional phrase/adverbial accusative (see Gen 15:6; 2 Sam 19:19; Job 13:24; 19:11; 33:10; Pss 32:2; 41:7; Amos 6:5).<br>
 <a name="fn1495" href="psa.htm#fnB1495"><sup>40</sup></a><b>sn</b> (40:17)  <i>Psalm 41</i>. The psalmist is confident (vv. 11-12) that the Lord has heard his request to be healed (vv. 4-10), and he anticipates the joy he will experience when the Lord intervenes (vv. 1-3). One must assume that the psalmist is responding to a divine oracle of assurance (see P. C. Craigie, <i>Psalms 1-50</i>, 319-20). The final verse is a fitting conclusion to this psalm, but it is also serves as a fitting conclusion to the first "book" (or major editorial division) of the Psalter. Similar statements appear at or near the end of each of the second, third, and fourth "books" of the Psalter (see Pss 72:19, 89:52, and 106:48 respectively).<br>
 <a name="fn1496" href="psa.htm#fnB1496"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (41:1)  The Hebrew noun is an abstract plural. The word often refers metonymically to the happiness that God-given security and prosperity produce (see Pss 1:1, 3; 2:12; 34:9; 65:4; 84:12; 89:15; 106:3; 112:1; 127:5; 128:1; 144:15).<br>
 <a name="fn1497" href="psa.htm#fnB1497"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (41:1)  <i>One who treats the poor properly</i>. The psalmist is characterizing himself as such an individual and supplying a reason why God has responded favorably to his prayer. The Lord's attitude toward the merciful mirrors their treatment of the poor.<br>
 <a name="fn1498" href="psa.htm#fnB1498"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (41:1)  <i>Heb</i> "in the day of trouble" (see Ps 27:5).<br>
 <a name="fn1499" href="psa.htm#fnB1499"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (41:1)  That is, the one who has been kind to the poor. The prefixed verbal form could be taken as jussive of prayer ("may the LORD deliver," see v. 2), but the preceding parallel line is a declaration of fact, not a prayer per se. The imperfect can be taken here as future ("will deliver," cf. NEB, NASB) or as generalizing ("delivers," cf. NIV, NRSV). The parallel line, which has a generalizing tone, favors the latter. At the same time, though the psalmist uses a generalizing style here, he clearly has himself primarily in view.<br>
 <a name="fn1500" href="psa.htm#fnB1500"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (41:2)  The prefixed verbal forms are taken as jussives in the translation because the jussive is clearly used in the final line of the verse, suggesting that this is a prayer. The psalmist stops to pronounce a prayer of blessing on the godly individual envisioned in v. 1. Of course, he actually has himself primarily in view. He mixes confidence (vv. 1, 3) with petition (v. 2) because he stands in the interval between the word of assurance and the actual intervention by God.<br>
 <a name="fn1501" href="psa.htm#fnB1501"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tc</b> (41:2)  The translation follows the consonantal Hebrew text (Kethib), which has a Pual (passive) prefixed form, regarded here as a jussive. The Pual of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> also appears in Prov 3:18. The marginal reading (Qere) assumes a <i>vav</i> consecutive and Pual perfect. Some, with the support of the LXX, change the verb to a Piel (active) form with an objective pronominal suffix, "and may he bless him," or "and he will bless him" (cf. NIV).<br>
 <a name="fn1502" href="psa.htm#fnB1502"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (41:2)  The negative particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la</FONT> before the prefixed verbal form indicates the verb is a jussive and the statement a prayer. Those who want to take v. 2 as a statement of confidence suggest emending the negative particle to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">al</FONT>, which is used with the imperfect. See the earlier note on the verbal forms in line one of this verse. According to GKC &#167;109.<i>e</i>, this is a case where the jussive is used rhetorically to "express that something cannot or should not happen" (see also BDB 39). In this case one might translate, "you will not turn him over to his enemies," and take the preceding verbal forms as indicative in mood.<br>
 <a name="fn1503" href="psa.htm#fnB1503"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (41:2)  <i>Heb</i> "do not give him over to the desire of his enemies" (see Ps 27:12).<br>
 <a name="fn1504" href="psa.htm#fnB1504"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (41:3)  The prefixed verbal form could be taken as jussive, continuing the prayer of v. 2, but the parallel line in v. 3b employs the perfect, suggesting that the psalmist is again speaking in the indicative mood (see v. 1b). The imperfect can be understood as future or as generalizing (see v. 1).<br>
 <a name="fn1505" href="psa.htm#fnB1505"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (41:3)  <i>Heb</i> "all his bed you turn in his illness." The perfect is used here in a generalizing sense (see v. 1) or in a rhetorical manner to emphasize that the healing is as good as done.<br>
 <a name="fn1506" href="psa.htm#fnB1506"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (41:4)  In vv. 4-10 the psalmist recites the prayer of petition and lament he offered to the Lord.<br>

 <a name="fn1514" href="psa.htm#fnB1514"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (41:8)  The words "they say" are not in the Hebrew text, but are supplied in the translation to make it clear that v. 8 contains a quotation of what the psalmist's enemies say about him (see v. 7a).<br>
 <a name="fn1515" href="psa.htm#fnB1515"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (41:8)  <i>Heb</i> "thing of worthlessness." In Ps 101:3 the phrase refers to evil deeds in general, but here it appears to refer more specifically to the illness that plagues the psalmist.<br>

But suddenly the mood changes as the nation laments a recent defeat. The stark contrast between the present and the past only heightens the nation's confusion. Israel trusted in God for victory, but the Lord rejected them and allowed them to be humiliated in battle. If Israel had been unfaithful to God, their defeat would make sense, but the nation was loyal to the Lord.

Note that the preceding word (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yhla</FONT>) ends in <i>mem</i>.

If this portion of the psalm contains the song of confidence/petition the Israelites recited prior to battle, then the imperfects here and in the next line may express their expectation of victory. Another option is that the imperfects function in an emphatic generalizing manner. In this case one might translate, "you [always] drive back...you [always] trample down."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (44:5)  The Hebrew verb translated "drive back" is literally "gore"; the imagery is that of a powerful wild ox that "gores" its enemies and tramples them underfoot.<br>

 <a name="fn1635" href="psa.htm#fnB1635"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (44:19)  <i>Heb</i> "yet you have battered us in a place of jackals."<br>
 <a name="fn1636" href="psa.htm#fnB1636"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (44:19)  The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twmlx</FONT> has traditionally been understood as a compound noun meaning "shadow of death" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lx@</FONT> + <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tw\m*</FONT>, see BDB 853, cf. NASB). Other scholars prefer to vocalize the form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tWml=x^</FONT> and understand it as an abstract noun (from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;lx</FONT>) meaning "darkness" (cf. NIV, NRSV). An examination of the word's usage favors the latter derivation. It is frequently associated with darkness/night and contrasted with light/morning (see Job 3:5; 10:21-22; 12:22; 24:17; 28:3; 34:22; Ps 107:10, 14; Isa 9:1; Jer 13:16; Amos 5:8). In some cases the darkness described is associated with the realm of death (Job 10:21-22; 38:17), but this is a metaphorical application of the word and does not reflect its inherent meaning. In Ps 44:19 darkness symbolizes defeat and humiliation.<br>
 <a name="fn1637" href="psa.htm#fnB1637"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (44:20)  <i>Heb</i> "If we had forgotten the name of our God." To "forget the name" here refers to rejecting the LORD's authority (see Jer 23:27) and abandoning him as an object of prayer and worship (see the next line).<br>
 <a name="fn1638" href="psa.htm#fnB1638"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (44:20)  <i>Heb</i> "and spread out your hands to another god." Spreading out the hands was a prayer gesture (see Exod 9:29, 33; 1 Kgs 8:22, 38; 2 Chr 6:12-13, 29; Ezra 9:15; Job 11:13; Isa 1:15). In its most fundamental sense <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rz</FONT> ("another; foreign; strange") refers to something that is outside one's circle, often making association with it inappropriate. A "strange" god is an alien deity, an "outside god" (see <i>TDOT</i> 4:54-55).<br>
 <a name="fn1639" href="psa.htm#fnB1639"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (44:21)  The active participle describes what is characteristically true.<br>

The expression "search out" is used metonymically here, referring to discovery, the intended effect of a search. The "heart" (i.e., mind) is here viewed as the seat of one's thoughts. The rhetorical question expects the answer, "Of course he would!" The point seems to be this: There is no way the Israelites who are the speakers in the psalm would reject God and turn to another god, for the omniscient God would easily discover such a sin.<br>
 <a name="fn1641" href="psa.htm#fnB1641"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (44:22)  The statement "because of you" (1) may simply indicate that God is the cause of the Israelites' defeat (see vv. 9-14, where the nation's situation is attributed directly to God's activity, and cf. NEB, NRSV), or (2) it may suggest they suffer because of their allegiance to God (see Ps 69:7 and Jer 15:15). In this case one should translate, "for your sake" (cf. NASB, NIV). The citation of this verse in Rom 8:36 follows the LXX (Ps 43:23 LXX), where the Greek term <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">e{neken</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jeneken</FONT>; LXX <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">e{neka</FONT>) may likewise mean "because of" or "for the sake of" (BAGD 264).<br>

 <a name="fn1656" href="psa.htm#fnB1656"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (45:2)  <i>Heb</i> "you are handsome from the sons of man." The preposition "from" is used in a comparative ("more than") sense.

 <a name="fn1657" href="psa.htm#fnB1657"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (45:2)  <i>Heb</i> "favor is poured out on your lips." "Lips" probably stands by metonymy for the king's speech. Some interpret the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/j</FONT> as referring here to "gracious (i.e., kind and polite) speech", but the word probably refers more generally to "attractive" speech that is impressively articulated and fitting for the occasion.

 <a name="fn1659" href="psa.htm#fnB1659"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (45:2)  Or "blesses you forever." Here "bless" means to "endue with the power and skill to rule effectively," as the following verses indicate.<br>

One could emend the text to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qdxw hw&#180;n&#180;u&amp;</FONT> ("[for the sake of truth], humility, and justice"). In this case "humility" would perhaps allude to the king's responsibility to "serve" his people by promoting justice (cf. NIV "in behalf of truth, humility and righteousness"). The present translation assumes an emendation to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/=uy</FONT> ("because; on account of") which would form a suitable parallel to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rbd-lu</FONT> ("because; for the sake of") in the preceding line.

After the imperatives in the first half of the verse, the prefixed verbal form with <i>vav</i> conjunctive likely indicates purpose ("so that your right hand might teach you mighty acts") or result (see the present translation). The "right hand" here symbolizes the king's military strength. His right hand will "teach" him mighty acts by performing them and thereby causing him to experience their magnificence.<br>
 <a name="fn1666" href="psa.htm#fnB1666"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (45:5)  <i>Heb</i> "your arrows are sharp--peoples beneath you fall--in the heart of the enemies of the king." The choppy style reflects the poet's excitement.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (45:6)  <i>O God.</i> The king is clearly the addressee here, as in vv. 2-5 and 7-9. Rather than taking the statement at face value, many prefer to emend the text because the concept of deifying the earthly king is foreign to ancient Israelite thinking (cf. NEB "your throne is like God's throne, eternal"). However, it is preferable to retain the text and take this statement as another instance of the royal hyperbole that permeates the royal psalms. Because the Davidic king is God's vice-regent on earth, the psalmist addresses him as if he were God incarnate. God energizes the king for battle and accomplishes justice through him. A similar use of hyperbole appears in Isa 9:6, where the ideal Davidic king of the eschaton is given the title "Mighty God" (see the note on this phrase there). Ancient Near Eastern art and literature picture gods training kings for battle, bestowing special weapons, and intervening in battle. According to Egyptian propaganda, the Hittites described Ramses II as follows: "No man is he who is among us, It is Seth great-of-strength, Baal in person; Not deeds of man are these his doings, They are of one who is unique" (see M. Lichtheim, <i>Ancient Egyptian Literature</i>, 2:67). Ps 45:6 and Isa. 9:6 probably envision a similar kind of response when friends and foes alike look at the Davidic king in full battle regalia. When the king's enemies oppose him on the battlefield, they are, as it were, fighting against God himself.<br>

Because the name Yahweh ("LORD") is relatively rare in Pss 42-83, where the name Elohim ("God") predominates, this compounding of Elohim may be an alternative form of the compound name "the LORD my/your/our God."<br>
 <a name="fn1673" href="psa.htm#fnB1673"><sup>21</sup></a><b>sn</b> (45:7)  <i>Anointed you</i>. When read in the light of the preceding context, the anointing is most naturally taken as referring to the king's coronation. However, the following context (vv. 8-9) focuses on the wedding ceremony, so some prefer to see this anointing as part of the king's preparations for the wedding celebration. Perhaps the reference to his anointing at his coronation facilitates the transition to the description of the wedding, for the king was also anointed on this occasion.<br>
 <a name="fn1674" href="psa.htm#fnB1674"><sup>22</sup></a><b>sn</b> (45:7)  The phrase <i>oil of joy</i> alludes to the fact that the coronation of the king, which was ritually accomplished by anointing his head with olive oil, was a time of great celebration and renewed hope. (If one understands the anointing in conjunction with the wedding ceremony, the "joy" would be that associated with the marriage.) The phrase "oil of joy" also appears in Isa 61:3, where mourners are granted "oil of joy" in conjunction with their deliverance from oppression.<br>
 <a name="fn1675" href="psa.htm#fnB1675"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (45:7)  <i>Heb</i> "from your companions." The "companions" are most naturally understood as others in the royal family or, more generally, as the king's countrymen.<br>

 <a name="fn1681" href="psa.htm#fnB1681"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (45:9)  This rare Hebrew noun apparently refers to the king's bride, who will soon be queen (see Neh 2:6). The Aramaic cognate is used of royal wives in Dan 5:2-3, 23.<br>
 <a name="fn1682" href="psa.htm#fnB1682"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (45:9)  <i>Heb</i> "a consort stands at your right hand, gold of Ophir."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (45:9)  <i>Gold from Ophir</i> is also mentioned in Isa 13:12 and Job 28:16. The precise location of Ophir is uncertain; Arabia, India, East Africa, and South Africa have all been suggested as options. See <i>HALOT</i> 23.<br>
 <a name="fn1683" href="psa.htm#fnB1683"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (45:10)  <i>Heb</i> "daughter." The Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tb</FONT> ("daughter") can sometimes refer to a young woman in a general sense (see <i>TDOT</i> 2:334).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (45:10)  <i>Listen, O princess</i>. The poet now addresses the bride.<br>
 <a name="fn1684" href="psa.htm#fnB1684"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (45:10)  <i>Heb</i> "see and turn your ear." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">har</FONT>, "see," is used here of mental observation (see BDB 907).<br>
 <a name="fn1685" href="psa.htm#fnB1685"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (45:10)  <i>Heb</i> "your people." This reference to the "people" of the princess suggests she was a foreigner. Perhaps the marriage was arranged as part of a political alliance between Israel (or Judah) and a neighboring state. The translation "your homeland" reflects such a situation.<br>
 <a name="fn1686" href="psa.htm#fnB1686"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (45:10)  <i>Heb</i> "and the house of your father."<br>
 <a name="fn1687" href="psa.htm#fnB1687"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (45:11)  After the preceding imperatives, the jussive verbal form with <i>vav</i> conjunctive is best understood as introducing a purpose ("so that the king might desire your beauty") or result clause (see the present translation and cf. also NASB). The point seems to be this: The bride might tend to be homesick, which in turn might cause her to mourn and diminish her attractiveness. She needs to overcome this temptation to unhappiness and enter into the marriage with joy. Then the king will be drawn to her natural beauty.<br>
 <a name="fn1688" href="psa.htm#fnB1688"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (45:11)  Or "desire."<br>
 <a name="fn1689" href="psa.htm#fnB1689"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (45:11)  Or "bow down."<br>
 <a name="fn1690" href="psa.htm#fnB1690"><sup>38</sup></a><b>sn</b> (45:11)  <i>Submit to him</i>. The poet here makes the point that the young bride is obligated to bring pleasure to her new husband. Though a foreign concept to modern western culture, this was accepted as the cultural norm in the psalmist's day.<br>
 <a name="fn1691" href="psa.htm#fnB1691"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (45:12)  <i>Heb</i> "and a daughter of Tyre with a gift, your face they will appease, the rich of people." The phrase "daughter of Tyre" occurs only here in the OT. It could be understood as addressed to the bride, indicating she was a Phoenician (cf. NEB). However, often in the OT the word "daughter," when collocated with the name of a city or country, is used to personify the referent (see, for example, "Daughter Zion" in Ps 9:14, and "Daughter Babylon" in Ps 137:8). If that is the case here, then "Daughter Tyre" identifies the city-state of Tyre as the place from which the rich people come (cf. NRSV). The idiom "appease the face" refers to seeking one's favor (see Exod 32:11; 1 Sam 13:12; 1 Kgs 13:6; 2 Kgs 13:4; 2 Chr 33:12; Job 11:19; Ps 119:58; Prov 19:6; Jer 26:19; Dan 9:13; Zech 7:2; 8:21-22; Mal 1:9).<br>

 <a name="fn1694" href="psa.htm#fnB1694"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tc</b> (45:13)  <i>Heb</i> "within, from settings of gold, her clothing." The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmynp</FONT> ("within"), if retained, would go with the preceding line and perhaps refer to the bride being "within" the palace or her bridal chamber (cf. NIV, NRSV). Since the next two lines refer to her attire (see also v. 9b), it is preferable to emend the form to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hynynp</FONT> ("her pearls") or to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ynynp</FONT> ("pearls"). The <i>mem</i> prefixed to "settings" is probably dittographic.<br>
 <a name="fn1695" href="psa.htm#fnB1695"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (45:14)  <i>Heb</i> "virgins after her, her companions, are led to you." Some emend <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">il</FONT> ("to you") to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hl</FONT> ("to her," i.e., the princess), because the princess is now being spoken of in the third person (vv. 13-14a), rather than being addressed directly (as in vv. 10-12). However, the ambiguous suffixed form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">il</FONT> need not be taken as second feminine singular. The suffix can be understood as a pausal second masculine singular form, addressed to the king. The translation assumes this to be the case; note that the king is addressed once more in vv. 16-17, where the second person pronouns are masculine.<br>
 <a name="fn1696" href="psa.htm#fnB1696"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (45:15)  <i>Heb</i> "they are led with joy and happiness, they enter the house of the king."<br>
 <a name="fn1697" href="psa.htm#fnB1697"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (45:16)  The pronoun is second masculine singular, indicating the king is being addressed from this point to the end of the psalm.<br>
 <a name="fn1698" href="psa.htm#fnB1698"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (45:16)  The prefixed verbal form could be taken as jussive and the statement interpreted as a prayer, "May your sons carry on the dynasty of your ancestors!" The next line could then be taken as a relative clause, "[your sons] whom you will make princes throughout the land."<br>
 <a name="fn1699" href="psa.htm#fnB1699"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (45:16)  <i>Heb</i> "in place of your fathers will be your sons."<br>
 <a name="fn1700" href="psa.htm#fnB1700"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (45:17)  <i>Heb</i> "I will cause your name to be remembered in every generation and generation." The cohortative verbal form expresses the poet's resolve. The king's "name" stands here for his reputation and character, which the poet praised in vv. 2-7.<br>
 <a name="fn1701" href="psa.htm#fnB1701"><sup>49</sup></a><b>sn</b> (45:17)  <i>The nations will praise you</i>. As God's vice-regent on earth, the king is deserving of such honor and praise.<br>
 <a name="fn1702" href="psa.htm#fnB1702"><sup>50</sup></a><b>sn</b> (45:17)  <i>Psalm 46</i>. In this so-called "Song Of Zion" God's people confidently affirm that they are secure because the great warrior-king dwells within Jerusalem and protects it from the nations that cause such chaos in the earth. A refrain (vv. 7, 11) concludes the song's two major sections.<br>
 <a name="fn1703" href="psa.htm#fnB1703"><sup>51</sup></a><b>sn</b> (45:17)  The meaning of the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twmlu</FONT> (<i>alamoth</i>, which means "young women") is uncertain; perhaps it refers to a particular style of music. See <i>HALOT</i> 836 and 1 Chr 15:20.<br>
 <a name="fn1704" href="psa.htm#fnB1704"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:1)  <i>Heb</i> "our shelter and strength," which probably means "our strong shelter" (see Ps 71:7). Another option is to translate, "our shelter and source of strength."<br>
 <a name="fn1705" href="psa.htm#fnB1705"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:1)  <i>Heb</i> "a helper in times of trouble he is found [to be] greatly." The perfect verbal form has a generalizing function here. The adverb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dam</FONT> ("greatly") has an emphasizing function.<br>
 <a name="fn1706" href="psa.htm#fnB1706"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:2)  The imperfect is taken in a generalizing sense (cf. NEB) because the situation described in vv. 2-3 is understood as symbolizing typical world conditions. In this case the imperfect draws attention to the typical nature of the response. The covenant community characteristically responds with confidence, not fear. Another option is to take the situation described as purely hypothetical. In this case one might translate, "We will not fear, even though the earth should shake" (cf. NIV, NRSV).<br>
 <a name="fn1707" href="psa.htm#fnB1707"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:2)  The Hiphil infinitival form is normally taken to mean "when [the earth] is altered," being derived from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rwm</FONT> ("to change"). In this case the Hiphil would be intransitive, as in Ps 15:4. <i>HALOT</i> (560) emends the form to a Niphal and derives it from a homonymic root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rwm</FONT> attested in Arabic with the meaning "shake."<br>
 <a name="fn1708" href="psa.htm#fnB1708"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:2)  <i>Heb</i> "heart of the seas." The plural may be used for emphasis, pointing to the deepest sea. Note that the next verse uses a singular pronoun ("its waters," "its swelling") in referring back to the plural noun.<br>
 <a name="fn1709" href="psa.htm#fnB1709"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:3)  <i>Heb</i> "its waters."<br>
 <a name="fn1710" href="psa.htm#fnB1710"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:3)  Or "roar."<br>
 <a name="fn1711" href="psa.htm#fnB1711"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:3)  The three imperfect verbal forms in v. 3 draw attention to the characteristic nature of the activity described.<br>
 <a name="fn1712" href="psa.htm#fnB1712"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:3)  <i>Heb</i> "at its swelling." The Hebrew word often means "pride." If the sea is symbolic of hostile nations, then this may be a case of double entendre. The surging, swelling sea symbolizes the proud, hostile nations. On the surface the psalmist appears to be depicting a major natural catastrophe, perhaps a tidal wave. If so, then the situation would be hypothetical. However, the repetition of the verbs <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmh</FONT> ("crash; roar," v. 3) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">fwm</FONT> ("shake," v. 2) in v. 6, where nations/kingdoms "roar" and "shake," suggests that the language of vv. 2-3 is symbolic and depicts the upheaval that characterizes relationships between the nations of the earth. As some nations (symbolized by the surging, chaotic waters) show hostility, others (symbolized by the mountains) come crashing down to destruction. The surging waters are symbolic of chaotic forces in other poetic texts (see, for example, Isa 17:12; Jer 51:42) and mountains can symbolize strong kingdoms (see, for example, Jer 51:25).<br>
 <a name="fn1713" href="psa.htm#fnB1713"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:4)  <i>Heb</i> "A river, its channels cause the city of God to be glad."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (46:4)  <i>The city of God</i> is Jerusalem (see Pss 48:1-2; 87:2-3). The river's "channels" are probably <i>irrigation ditches</i> vital to growing crops. Some relate the imagery to the "waters of Shiloah" (see Isa 8:6), which flowed from the Gihon spring to the pool of Siloam. In Isa 8:6-8 these waters are contrasted with the flood waters symbolizing Assyria. Even if this is the reality behind the imagery, the picture of a river flowing through Jerusalem is idealized and exaggerated. The river and irrigation ditches symbolize the peace and prosperity that the Lord provides for Jerusalem, in contrast to the havoc produced by the turbulent waters (symbolic of the nations) outside the city. Some see here an adaptation of Canaanite (or, more specifically, Jebusite) mythical traditions of rivers/springs flowing from the high god El's dwelling place. The Songs of Zion do utilize such imagery at times (see Ps 48:2). The image of a river flowing through Zion may have inspired prophetic visions of an eschatological river flowing from the temple (see Ezek 47:1-12; Joel 3:18).<br>
 <a name="fn1714" href="psa.htm#fnB1714"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:4)  <i>Heb</i> "the holy [place] of the dwelling places of." The adjective "holy" is used here in a substantival manner and placed in construct with the following noun (see GKC &#167;132.<i>c</i>). Origen's transliterated text assumes the reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vd\q)</FONT> ("holiness; holy place"), while the LXX assumes a Piel verbal form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vD}q!</FONT>, "makes holy," and takes the following form as "his dwelling place." The plural form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ynkvm</FONT>, "dwelling places of," is probably a plural of degree, emphasizing the special character of this dwelling place. See GKC &#167;124.<i>b</i>. The form stands as an appositional genitive in relation to the preceding construct noun.<br>
 <a name="fn1715" href="psa.htm#fnB1715"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:4)  <i>Heb</i> "Most High." This divine title (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/oyl=u#</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u#l=yo/</FONT>) pictures God as the exalted ruler of the universe who vindicates the innocent and judges the wicked. See especially Pss 7:17; 9:2; 18:13; 21:7; 47:2.<br>
 <a name="fn1716" href="psa.htm#fnB1716"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:5)  <i>Heb</i> "God [is] within her." The feminine singular pronoun refers to the city mentioned in v. 4.<br>
 <a name="fn1717" href="psa.htm#fnB1717"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:5)  Another option is to translate the imperfect verbal form as future, "it will not be upended." Even if one chooses this option, the future tense must be understood in a generalizing sense. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">fwm</FONT>, translated "upended" here, is used in v. 2 of the mountains "tumbling" into the seas and in v. 6 of nations being "upended." By way of contrast, Jerusalem, God's dwelling place, is secure and immune from such turmoil and destruction.<br>
 <a name="fn1718" href="psa.htm#fnB1718"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:5)  Or "helps her." The imperfect draws attention to the generalizing character of the statement.<br>
 <a name="fn1719" href="psa.htm#fnB1719"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:5)  <i>Heb</i> "at the turning of morning." (For other uses of the expression see Exod 14:27 and Judg 19:26).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (46:5)  <i>At the break of dawn</i>. The "morning" is viewed metaphorically as a time of deliverance and vindication after the dark "night" of trouble (see Ps 30:5; Isa 17:14). There may be an allusion here to Exod 14:27 (where the Lord destroyed the Egyptians at the "break of dawn") or, more likely, to the miraculous deliverance of Jerusalem from the Assyrian siege, when the people discovered the dead bodies of the Assyrian army in the morning (Isa 37:36).<br>
 <a name="fn1720" href="psa.htm#fnB1720"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:6)  <i>Heb</i> "nations roar, kingdoms shake." The Hebrew verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmh</FONT> ("make a commotion") is used in v. 3 of the waves crashing, while the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">fwm</FONT> ("upended") is used in v. 2 of mountains tumbling into the sea (see also v. 5, where the psalm affirms that Jerusalem "cannot be upended"). The repetition of the verbs suggests that the language of vv. 2-3 is symbolic and depicts the upheaval that characterizes relationships between the nations of the earth. As some nations (symbolized by the surging, chaotic waters) show hostility, others (symbolized by the mountains) come crashing down to destruction. The surging waters are symbolic of chaotic forces in other poetic texts (see, for example, Isa 17:12; Jer 51:42) and mountains can symbolize strong kingdoms (see, for example, Jer 51:25).<br>
 <a name="fn1721" href="psa.htm#fnB1721"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:6)  <i>Heb</i> "He." God is the obvious referent here (see v. 5), and has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn1722" href="psa.htm#fnB1722"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:6)  <i>Heb</i> "offers his voice." In theophanic texts the phrase refers to God's thunderous shout which functions as a battle cry (see Pss 18:13; 68:33).<br>
 <a name="fn1723" href="psa.htm#fnB1723"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:6)  Or "melts." See Amos 9:5. The image depicts the nation's helplessness before Jerusalem's defender, who annihilates their armies (see vv. 8-9).

 <a name="fn1724" href="psa.htm#fnB1724"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:7)  <i>Heb</i> "the LORD of hosts is with us." The title "LORD of hosts" here pictures the LORD as a mighty warrior-king who leads armies into battle (see Ps 24:10). The military imagery is further developed in vv. 8-9.<br>

 <a name="fn1728" href="psa.htm#fnB1728"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:8)  <i>Heb</i> "who sets desolations in the earth" (see Isa 13:9). The active participle describes God's characteristic activity as a warrior.<br>
 <a name="fn1729" href="psa.htm#fnB1729"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:9)  <i>Heb</i> "[the] one who causes wars to cease unto the end of the earth." The participle continues the description begun in v. 8b and indicates that this is the LORD's characteristic activity. Ironically, he brings peace to the earth by devastating the warlike, hostile nations (vv. 8, 9b).<br>
 <a name="fn1730" href="psa.htm#fnB1730"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:9)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rbv</FONT> ("break") appears in the Piel here (see Ps 29:5). In the OT it occurs thirty-six times in the Piel, always with multiple objects (the object is either a collective singular or grammatically plural or dual form). The Piel may highlight the repetition of the pluralative action, or it may suggest an intensification of action, indicating repeated action comprising a whole, perhaps with the nuance "break again and again, break in pieces." Another option is to understand the form as resultative, "make broken" (see <i>IBHS</i> 405). The imperfect verbal form carries on and emphasizes the generalizing nature of the description.<br>
 <a name="fn1731" href="psa.htm#fnB1731"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:9)  The perfect verbal form with <i>vav</i> consecutive carries along the generalizing emphasis of the preceding imperfect.<br>

In this context, where military weapons are mentioned, it is better to revocalize the form as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tolg]u&amp;</FONT>, "round shields," a word which occurs only here in the OT, but is attested in later Hebrew and Aramaic (see <i>HALOT</i> 784).<br>
 <a name="fn1734" href="psa.htm#fnB1734"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:10)  The words "he says" are supplied in the translation for clarification.<br>

This statement may be addressed to the hostile nations, indicating they should cease their efforts to destroy God's people, or to Judah, indicating they should rest secure in God's protection. Since the psalm is an expression of Judah's trust and confidence, it is more likely that the words are directed to the nations, who are actively promoting chaos and are in need of a rebuke.<br>
 <a name="fn1736" href="psa.htm#fnB1736"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (46:10)  Elsewhere in the psalms the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;wr</FONT> ("be exalted") when used of God, refers to his exalted position as king (Pss 18:46; 99:2; 113:4; 138:6) and/or his self-revelation as king through his mighty deeds of deliverance (Pss 21:13; 57:5, 11).<br>

 <a name="fn1753" href="psa.htm#fnB1753"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (47:5)  <i>God ascended his throne</i>. In the context of vv. 3-4, which refer to the conquest of the land under Joshua, v. 5 is best understood as referring to an historical event. When the Lord conquered the land and placed his people in it, he assumed a position of kingship, as predicted by Moses (see Exod 15:17-18, as well as Ps 114:1-2). That event is here described metaphorically in terms of a typical coronation ceremony for an earthly king (see 2 Sam 15:10; 2 Kgs 9:13). Verses 1-2, 8-9 focus on God's continuing kingship, which extends over all nations.<br>
 <a name="fn1754" href="psa.htm#fnB1754"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (47:5)  <i>Heb</i> "God ascended amid a shout." The words "his throne" are supplied in the translation for clarification.

The word is derived from a verb meaning "to be prudent; to be wise" (see BDB 968). Various options are: "a contemplative song," "a song imparting moral wisdom," or "a skillful [i.e., well-written] song."  The term also occurs in the superscriptions of Pss 32, 42, 44, 45, 52-55, 74, 78, 88, 89, and 142. Here, in a context of celebration, the meaning "skillful, well-written" would fit particularly well.<br>
 <a name="fn1757" href="psa.htm#fnB1757"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (47:8)  When a new king was enthroned, his followers would acclaim him king using this enthronement formula (Qal perfect 3ms <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ilm</FONT>, "to reign," followed by the name of the king). See 2 Sam 15:10; 1 Kgs 1:11, 13, 18; 2 Kgs 9:13, as well as Isa 52:7. In this context the perfect verbal form is generalizing, but the declaration logically follows the historical reference in v. 5 to the LORD's having ascended his throne.<br>
 <a name="fn1758" href="psa.htm#fnB1758"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tc</b> (47:9)  The words "along with" do not appear in the MT. However, the LXX has "with," suggesting that the original text may have read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;u^ &lt;u!</FONT> ("along with the people"). In this case the MT is haplographic (the consonantal sequence <i>ayin</i>-<i>mem</i> being written once instead of twice). Another option is that the LXX is simply and correctly interpreting "people" as an adverbial accusative and supplying the appropriate preposition.<br>
 <a name="fn1759" href="psa.htm#fnB1759"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (47:9)  <i>Heb</i> "for to God [belong] the shields of the earth."

The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[wn</FONT> ("height") is a genitive of specification after the qualitative noun "beautiful."

 <a name="fn1764" href="psa.htm#fnB1764"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (48:2)  <i>A source of joy to the whole earth</i>. The language is hyperbolic.

 <a name="fn1765" href="psa.htm#fnB1765"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (48:2)  <i>Heb</i> "Mount Zion, the peaks of Zaphon." Like all the preceding phrases in v. 2, both phrases are appositional to "city of our God, his holy hill" in v. 1, suggesting an identification in the poet's mind between Mount Zion and Zaphon. "Zaphon" usually refers to the "north" in a general sense (see Pss 89:12; 107:3), but here, where it is collocated with "peaks," it refers specifically to Mount Zaphon, located in the vicinity of ancient Ugarit and viewed as the mountain where the gods assembled (see Isa 14:13). By alluding to West Semitic mythology in this way, the psalm affirms that Mount Zion is the real divine mountain, for it is here that the LORD God of Israel lives and rules over the nations. See P. Craigie, <i>Psalms 1-50</i>, 353, and T. N. D. Mettinger, <i>In Search of God</i>, 103.<br>

 <a name="fn1767" href="psa.htm#fnB1767"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (48:4)  The logical connection between vv. 3-4 seems to be this: God is the protector of Zion and reveals himself as the city's defender--this is necessary because hostile armies threaten the city.<br>
 <a name="fn1768" href="psa.htm#fnB1768"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (48:4)  The perfect verbal forms in vv. 4-6 are understood as descriptive. In dramatic style (note <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnh</FONT>, "look") the psalm describes an enemy attack against the city as if it were occurring at this very moment. Another option is to take the perfects as narrational ("the kings assembled, they advanced"), referring to a particular historical event, such as Sennacherib's siege of the city in 701 B.C. (cf. NIV, NRSV). Even if one translates the verses in a dramatic-descriptive manner (as the present translation does), the LORD's victory over the Assyrians was probably what served as the inspiration of the description (see v. 8).<br>
 <a name="fn1769" href="psa.htm#fnB1769"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (48:5)  The object of "see" is omitted, but v. 3b suggests that the LORD's self-revelation as the city's defender is what they see.<br>

 <a name="fn1774" href="psa.htm#fnB1774"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (48:7)  The switch to the imperfect, as well as the introduction of the ship metaphor, perhaps signals a change to a generalizing tone; the LORD typically shatters these large ships, symbolic of the human strength of hostile armies (see the following note on "large ships"). The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rbv</FONT> ("break") appears in the Piel here (see Pss 29:5; 46:9). In the OT it occurs thirty-six times in the Piel, always with multiple objects (the object is either a collective singular or grammatically plural or dual form). The Piel may highlight the repetition of the pluralative action, or it may suggest an intensification of action, indicating repeated action comprising a whole, perhaps with the nuance "break again and again, break in pieces." Another option is to understand the form as resultative, "make broken" (see <i>IBHS</i> 405).<br>
 <a name="fn1775" href="psa.htm#fnB1775"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (48:7)  <i>Heb</i> "the ships of Tarshish." This probably refers to large ships either made in or capable of traveling to and from the distant western port of Tarshish. These ships, which were the best of their class, here symbolize the mere human strength of hostile armies, which are incapable of withstanding the LORD's divine power (see Isa 2:16).<br>
 <a name="fn1776" href="psa.htm#fnB1776"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (48:8)  <i>Heb</i> "As we have heard, so we have seen." The community had heard about God's mighty deeds in the nation's history.

It is preferable to understand the phrase as a musical direction of some sort (see <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twm-lu</FONT> in the superscription of Ps 9) or to emend the text to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toml*u&amp;-lu^</FONT> ("according to the <i>alamoth</i> style"; see the heading of Ps 46). In either case it should be understood as belonging with the superscription of the following psalm.<br>
 <a name="fn1791" href="psa.htm#fnB1791"><sup>30</sup></a><b>sn</b> (48:14)  <i>Psalm 49</i>. In this so-called wisdom psalm (see v. 3) the psalmist states that he will not fear the rich enemies who threaten him, for despite their wealth, they are mere men who will die like everyone else.

 <a name="fn1792" href="psa.htm#fnB1792"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:1)  The rare noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dl#j*</FONT> ("world") occurs in Ps 17:14 and perhaps also in Isa 38:11 (see the note on "world" there).<br>
 <a name="fn1793" href="psa.htm#fnB1793"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:2)  <i>Heb</i> "even the sons of mankind, even the sons of man." Because of the parallel line, where "rich and poor" are mentioned, some treat these expressions as polar opposites, with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;da ynb</FONT> referring to the lower classes and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vya ynb</FONT> to higher classes (cf. NIV, NRSV). But usage does not support such a view. The rare phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vya ynb</FONT> ("sons of man") appears to refer to human beings in general in its other uses (see Pss 4:2; 62:9; Lam 3:33). It is better to understand "even the sons of mankind" and "even the sons of man" as synonymous expressions (cf. NEB "all mankind, every living man"). The repetition emphasizes the need for all people to pay attention, for the psalmist's message is relevant to everyone.<br>
 <a name="fn1794" href="psa.htm#fnB1794"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:3)  <i>Heb</i> "my mouth will speak wisdom." According to BDB the plural <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twmkj</FONT>, "wisdom," indicates degree or emphasis here (BDB 315).<br>
 <a name="fn1795" href="psa.htm#fnB1795"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:3)  <i>Heb</i> "and the meditation of my heart [i.e., mind] is understanding." The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twgh</FONT> ("meditation"), derived from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hgh</FONT> ("to recite quietly; to meditate"), here refers to thoughts that are verbalized (see the preceding line). The plural form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twnwbt</FONT> ("understanding") indicates degree or emphasis (see GKC &#167;124.<i>e</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn1796" href="psa.htm#fnB1796"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:4)  <i>Heb</i> "I will turn my ear to a wise saying, I will open [i.e., "reveal; explain"] my insightful saying with a harp." In the first line the psalmist speaks as a pupil who learns a song of wisdom from a sage. This suggests that the resulting insightful song derives from another source, perhaps God himself. Elsewhere the Hebrew word pair <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hdyj</FONT>/<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lvm</FONT> refers to a taunt song (Hab 2:6), a parable (Ezek 17:2), lessons from history (Ps 78:2), and proverbial sayings (Prov 1:6). Here it appears to refer to the insightful song that follows, which reflects on the mortality of humankind and the ultimate inability of riches to prevent the inevitable--death. Another option is that the word pair refers more specifically to the closely related proverbial sayings of vv. 12, 20 (note the use of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lvm</FONT> ["to be like"] in both verses). In this case the psalmist first hears the sayings and then explains (<i>Heb</i> "opens") their significance (see vv. 5-11, 13-19).<br>
 <a name="fn1797" href="psa.htm#fnB1797"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:5)  <i>Heb</i> "days of trouble." The phrase also occurs in Ps 94:13. The question is rhetorical; there is no reason to be afraid when the rich oppressors threaten the weak (see v. 17). The following verses explain why this is so.<br>
 <a name="fn1798" href="psa.htm#fnB1798"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tc</b> (49:5)  The MT has, "the iniquity of my heels surrounds me." The clause is best understood as temporal and as elaborating on the preceding phrase "times of trouble." If the MT is retained, the genitive "of my heels" would probably indicate location ("the iniquity at my heels"); the sinful actions of the rich threaten to overtake the psalmist, as it were. It is better, however, to emend <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yb^q@u&amp;</FONT> ("my heels") to either (1) <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yB^q%u&amp;</FONT> ("my deceitful ones," i.e., "those who deceive me" [from the adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bq)u*</FONT>, "deceitful," see Jer 17:9]) or (2) <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yb^q=u)</FONT> ("those who deceive me" [a suffixed active participle from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bqu</FONT>, "betray, deceive"]). Origen's transliteration of the Hebrew text favors the first of these options. Either of the emendations provides a much smoother transition to v. 6, because "those who trust in their wealth" would then be appositional to "those who deceive me."<br>
 <a name="fn1799" href="psa.htm#fnB1799"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:6)  <i>Heb</i> "the ones who trust." The substantival participle stands in apposition to "those who deceive me" (v. 5).<br>

 <a name="fn1801" href="psa.htm#fnB1801"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:7)  <i>Heb</i> "a brother, he surely does not ransom, a man." The sequence <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vya</FONT>...<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ja</FONT> ("a brother...a man") is problematic, for the usual combination is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ja</FONT>...<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ja</FONT> ("a brother...a brother") or <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vya</FONT>...<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vya</FONT> ("a man...a man"). When <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vya</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ja</FONT> are combined, the usual order is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ja</FONT>...<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vya</FONT> ("a man...a brother"), with "brother" having a third masculine singular suffix, "his brother." This suggests that "brother" is the object of the verb and "man" the subject. (1) Perhaps the altered word order and absence of the suffix can be explained by the text's poetic character, for ellipsis is a feature of Hebrew poetic style. (2) Another option, supported by a few medieval Hebrew MSS, is to emend "brother" to the similar sounding <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ia</FONT> ("surely; but") which occurs in v. 15 before the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hdP</FONT> ("ransom"). If this reading is accepted the Qal imperfect <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hD\p=y]</FONT> ("he can[not] ransom") would need to be emended to a Niphal (passive) form, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hd\P*y]</FONT> ("he can[not] be ransomed") unless one understands the subject of the Qal verb to be indefinite ("one cannot redeem a man"). (A Niphal imperfect can be collocated with a Qal infinitive absolute. See GKC &#167;113.<i>w</i>.) No matter how one decides the textual issues, the imperfect in this case is modal, indicating potential, and the infinitive absolute emphasizes the statement.<br>
 <a name="fn1802" href="psa.htm#fnB1802"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:7)  <i>Heb</i> "he cannot pay to God his ransom price." Num 35:31 may supply the legal background for the metaphorical language used here. The psalmist pictures God as having a claim on the soul of the individual. When God comes to claim the life that ultimately belongs to him, he demands a ransom price that is beyond the capability of anyone to pay. The psalmist's point is that God has ultimate authority over life and death; all the money in the world cannot buy anyone a single day of life beyond what God has decreed.<br>
 <a name="fn1803" href="psa.htm#fnB1803"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:8)  <i>Heb</i> "their life." Some emend the text to "his life," understanding the antecedent of the pronoun as "brother" in v. 7. However, the man and brother of v. 7 are representative of the human race in general, perhaps explaining why a plural pronoun appears in v. 8. Of course, the plural pronoun could refer back to "the rich" mentioned in v. 6. Another option (the one assumed in the translation) is that the suffixed <i>mem</i> is enclitic. In this case the "ransom price for human life" is referred to an abstract, general way.<br>
 <a name="fn1804" href="psa.htm#fnB1804"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:8)  <i>Heb</i> "and one ceases forever." The translation assumes an indefinite subject which in turn is representative of the entire human race ("one," that refers to human beings without exception). The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ldj</FONT> ("cease") is understood in the sense of "come to an end; fail" (i.e., die). Another option is to translate, "and one ceases/refrains forever." In this case the idea is that the living, convinced of the reality of human mortality, give up all hope of "buying off" God and refrain from trying to do so.<br>
 <a name="fn1805" href="psa.htm#fnB1805"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:9)  The jussive verbal form with <i>vav</i> conjunctive is taken as indicating purpose/result in relation to the statement made in v. 8. (On this use of the jussive after an imperfect, see GKC &#167;109.<i>f</i>.) In this case v. 8 is understood as a parenthetical comment.<br>
 <a name="fn1806" href="psa.htm#fnB1806"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:9)  <i>Heb</i> "see the Pit." The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tjv</FONT> ("pit") is often used as a title for Sheol (see Pss 16:10; 30:9; 55:24; 103:4).<br>

 <a name="fn1809" href="psa.htm#fnB1809"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:10)  The imperfect verbal forms here and in the next line draw attention to what is characteristically true. The <i>vav</i> consecutive with perfect in the third line carries the same force.<br>
 <a name="fn1810" href="psa.htm#fnB1810"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:10)  <i>Heb</i> "together a fool and a brutish [man] perish."

 <a name="fn1811" href="psa.htm#fnB1811"><sup>20</sup></a><b>sn</b> (49:10)  Death shows no respect for anyone. No matter how <i>wise</i> or foolish an individual happens to be, <i>all pass away</i>.<br>

If one follows the MT, then <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">brq</FONT> ("inward part") must refer to the seat of these people's thoughts (for other examples of this use of the term, see BDB 899, though BDB prefers an emendation in this passage). In this case all three lines of v. 11 expose these people's arrogant assumption that they will last forever, which then stands in sharp contrast to reality as summarized in v. 12. In this case one might translate the first two lines, "they think that their houses are permanent and that their dwelling places will last forever" (cf. NASB). Following the lead of several ancient versions, the present translation assumes an emendation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;brq</FONT> ("their inward part") to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrbq</FONT> ("graves"). This assumes that the letters <i>bet</i> and <i>resh</i> were accidentally transposed in the MT. In this case the first two lines support the point made in v. 10, while the third line of v. 11 stands in contrast to v. 12. The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;lwu tyb</FONT> ("permanent house") is used of a tomb in Eccl 12:5 (as well as in Phoenician tomb inscriptions, see <i>DNWSI</i>, 160 for a list of texts) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/kvm</FONT> ("dwelling place") refers to a tomb in Isa 22:16. Cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV.<br>
 <a name="fn1813" href="psa.htm#fnB1813"><sup>22</sup></a><b>sn</b> (49:11)  Naming <i>their lands after themselves</i> is a claim of possession (see BDB 895).<br>
 <a name="fn1814" href="psa.htm#fnB1814"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:12)  <i>Heb</i> "but mankind in honor does not remain." The construction <i>vav</i> + noun at the beginning of the verse can be taken as contrastive in relation to what precedes. The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rqy</FONT> ("honor") probably refers here to the wealth mentioned in the preceding context (see <i>HALOT</i> 432). The imperfect verbal form draws attention to what is characteristically true. Some scholars emend <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/yly</FONT> ("remains") to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/yby</FONT> ("understands") but this is an unnecessary accommodation to the wording of v. 20.<br>
 <a name="fn1815" href="psa.htm#fnB1815"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:12)  Or "cattle."<br>
 <a name="fn1816" href="psa.htm#fnB1816"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:12)  The verb is derived from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmd</FONT> ("cease; destroy"; BDB 198). Another option is to derive the verb from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmd</FONT> ("be silent"; see <i>HALOT</i> 225, which sees two homonymic roots [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmd</FONT>, "be silent," and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmd</FONT>, "destroy"] rather than a single root) and translate, "they are like dumb beasts." This makes particularly good sense in v. 20, where the preceding line focuses on mankind's lack of understanding.<br>
 <a name="fn1817" href="psa.htm#fnB1817"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:13)  <i>Heb</i> "this [is] their way, [there is] folly [belonging] to them." The Hebrew term translated "this" could refer (1) back to the preceding verse[s] or (2) ahead to the subsequent statements. The translation assumes the latter, since v. 12 appears to be a refrain that concludes the psalm's first major section and marks a structural boundary. (A similar refrain [see v. 20] concludes the second half of the psalm.) The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ird</FONT> ("way") often refers to one's lifestyle, but, if it relates to what follows, then here it likely refers metonymically to one's destiny (the natural outcome of one's lifestyle [cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV "fate"]). (See the discussion in <i>TDOT</i> 3:285.) If one prefers the more common nuance ("lifestyle"), then the term would look back to the self-confident attitude described in the earlier verses.<br>
 <a name="fn1818" href="psa.htm#fnB1818"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:13)  <i>Heb</i> "and after them, in their mouth they take delight." The meaning of the MT is not entirely clear. "After them" is understood here as substantival, "those who come after them" or "those who follow them." "Their mouth" is taken as a metonymy for the arrogant attitude verbalized by the rich. In the expression "take delight in," the preposition -<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">b</FONT> introduces the object/cause of one's delight (see Pss 147:10; 149:4). So the idea here is that those who come after/follow the rich find the philosophy of life they verbalize and promote to be attractive and desirable.<br>
 <a name="fn1819" href="psa.htm#fnB1819"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:14)  <i>Heb</i> "like sheep to Sheol they are appointed." The verb form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wtv</FONT> is apparently derived from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ttv</FONT>, which appears to be a variant of the more common <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tyv</FONT> ("to place; to set"; BDB 1060 and GKC &#167;67.<i>ee</i>). Some scholars emend the text to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wjv</FONT> (from the verbal root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jwv</FONT> ["sink down"]) and read "they descend." The present translation assumes an emendation to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wfv</FONT> (from the verbal root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">fwv</FONT> ["go; wander"]), "they travel, wander." (The letter <i>tet</i> and <i>tav</i> sound similar; a scribe transcribing from dictation could easily confuse them.) The perfect verbal form is used in a rhetorical manner to speak of their destiny as if it were already realized (the so-called perfect of certitude or prophetic perfect).<br>
 <a name="fn1820" href="psa.htm#fnB1820"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:14)  <i>Heb</i> "death will shepherd them," that is, death itself (personified here as a shepherd) will lead them like a flock of helpless, unsuspecting sheep to Sheol, the underworld, the land of the dead.<br>
 <a name="fn1821" href="psa.htm#fnB1821"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:14)  The prefixed verbal form with <i>vav</i> consecutive carries the same force as the perfect verbal form in v. 14a. The psalmist speaks of this coming event as if it were already accomplished.<br>
 <a name="fn1822" href="psa.htm#fnB1822"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:14)  <i>Heb</i> "will rule over them in the morning." "Morning" here is a metaphor for a time of deliverance and vindication after the dark "night" of trouble (see Pss 30:5; 46:5; 59:16; 90:14; 143:8; Isa 17:14). In this context the psalmist confidently anticipates a day of vindication when the LORD will deliver the oppressed from the rich (see v. 15) and send the oppressors to Sheol.<br>
 <a name="fn1823" href="psa.htm#fnB1823"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:14)  <i>Heb</i> "their form [will become an object] for the consuming of Sheol, from a lofty residence, to him." The meaning of this syntactically difficult text is uncertain. The translation assumes that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rwx</FONT> ("form"; this is the Qere [marginal] reading; the Kethib has <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ryx</FONT> ["their image"]) refers to their physical form or bodies. "Sheol" is taken as the subject of "consume" (on the implied "become" before the infinitive "to consume" see GKC &#167;114.<i>k</i>). The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m</FONT> prefixed to "lofty residence" is understood as privative, "away from; so as not." The preposition -<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l</FONT> is possessive, while the third person pronominal suffix is understood as a representative singular.<br>
 <a name="fn1824" href="psa.htm#fnB1824"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:15)  Or "certainly."<br>

 <a name="fn1829" href="psa.htm#fnB1829"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (49:15)  <i>Heb</i> "he will take me." To improve the poetic balance of the verse, some move the words "from the power of Sheol" to the following line. The verse would then read: "But God will rescue my life; / from the power of Sheol he will certainly deliver me" (cf. NEB).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (49:15)  According to some, the psalmist here anticipates the resurrection (or at least an afterlife in God's presence). But it is more likely that the psalmist here expresses his hope that God <i>will rescue</i> him from premature death at the hands of the rich oppressors denounced in the psalm. The psalmist is well aware that all (the wise and foolish) die (see vv. 7-12), but he is confident God will lead him safely through the present "times of trouble" (v. 5) and sweep the wicked away to their final destiny. The theme is a common one in the so-called wisdom psalms (see Pss 1, 34, 37, 112). For a fuller discussion of the psalmists' view of the afterlife, see R. B. Chisholm, Jr., "A Theology of the Psalms," in <i>A Biblical Theology of the Old Testament</i>, ed. R. B. Zuck, 284-88.<br>

 <a name="fn1838" href="psa.htm#fnB1838"><sup>47</sup></a><b>sn</b> (49:20)  <i>Psalm 50</i>. This psalm takes the form of a covenant lawsuit in which the Lord comes to confront his people in a formal manner (as in Isa 1:2-20).

 <a name="fn1839" href="psa.htm#fnB1839"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (50:1)  Israel's God is here identified with three names: "<i>El</i>" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la</FONT>, or "God"), "<i>Elohim</i>" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yhla</FONT>, or "God"), and "<i>Yahweh</i>" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwhy</FONT>, or "the LORD"). There is an obvious allusion here to Josh 22:22, the only other passage where these three names appear in succession. In that passage the Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh declare, "El, God, the LORD! El, God, the LORD! He knows the truth! Israel must also know! If we have rebelled or disobeyed the LORD, don't spare us today!" In that context the other tribes had accused the trans-Jordanian tribes of breaking God's covenant by worshiping idols. The trans-Jordanian tribes appealed to "El, God, the LORD" as their witness that they were innocent of the charges brought against them. Ironically here in Ps 50 "<i>El, God, the </i>LORD" accuses his sinful covenant people of violating the covenant and warns that he will not spare them if they persist in their rebellion.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (50:15)  In vv. 7-15 the Lord makes it clear that he was not rebuking Israel because they had failed to offer sacrifices (v. 8a). On the contrary, they had been faithful in doing so (v. 8b). However, their understanding of the essence of their relationship with God was confused. Apparently they believed that he needed/desired such sacrifices and that offering them would ensure their prosperity. But the Lord owns all the animals of the world and did not need Israel's meager sacrifices (vv. 9-13). Other aspects of the relationship were more important to the Lord. He desired Israel to be thankful for his blessings (v. 14a), to demonstrate gratitude for his intervention by repaying the vows they made to him (v. 14b), and to acknowledge their absolute dependence on him (v. 15a). Rather than viewing their sacrifices as somehow essential to God's well-being, they needed to understand their dependence on him.<br>

The singular adjective is used here in a representative sense; it refers to those within the larger covenant community who have blatantly violated the LORD's commandments.

 <b>sn</b> (50:21)  The Lord <i>was silent</i> in the sense that he delayed punishment. Of course, God's patience toward sinners eventually runs out. The divine "silence" is only temporary (see v. 3, where the psalmist, having described God's arrival, observes that "he is not silent").<br>

 <a name="fn1880" href="psa.htm#fnB1880"><sup>42</sup></a><b>sn</b> (50:23)  <i>Psalm 51</i>. The psalmist confesses his sinfulness to God and begs for forgiveness and a transformation of his inner character. According to the psalm superscription, David offered this prayer when Nathan confronted him with his sin following the king's affair with Bathsheba (see 2 Sam 11-12). However, the final two verses of the psalm hardly fit this situation, for they assume the walls of Jerusalem have been destroyed and that the sacrificial system has been temporarily suspended. These verses are probably an addition to the psalm made during the period of exile following the fall of Jerusalem in 586 B.C. The exiles could relate to David's experience, for they, like him, and had been forced to confront their sin. They appropriated David's ancient prayer and applied it to their own circumstances.<br>

 <a name="fn1884" href="psa.htm#fnB1884"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:1)  Traditionally "blot out my transgressions." Because of the reference to washing and cleansing in the following verse, it is likely that the psalmist is comparing forgiveness to wiping an object clean (note the use of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hjm</FONT> in the sense of "wipe clean; dry" in 2 Kgs 21:13; Prov 30:20; Isa 25:8). Another option is that the psalmist is comparing forgiveness to erasing or blotting out names from a register (see Exod 32:32-33). In this case one might translate, "erase all record of my rebellious acts."<br>
 <a name="fn1885" href="psa.htm#fnB1885"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:2)  <i>Heb</i> "Thoroughly wash me from my wrongdoing."<br>
 <a name="fn1886" href="psa.htm#fnB1886"><sup>5</sup></a><b>sn</b> (51:2)  In vv. 1b-2 the psalmist uses three different words to emphasize the multi-faceted character and degree of his sin. Whatever one wants to call it ("rebellious acts," "wrongdoing," "sin"), he has done it and stands morally polluted in God's sight. The same three words appear in Exod 34:7, which emphasizes that God is willing to forgive sin in all of its many dimensions. In v. 2 the psalmist compares forgiveness and restoration to physical cleansing. Perhaps he likens spiritual cleansing to the purification rites of priestly law.<br>

To clarify the point of the hyperbole, the translation uses "especially," rather than the potentially confusing "only."<br>
 <a name="fn1890" href="psa.htm#fnB1890"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:4)  The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/uml</FONT> normally indicates purpose ("in order that"), but here it introduces a logical consequence of the preceding statement.

The prefixed verbal form in the second line is probably a preterite (without <i>vav</i> consecutive), stating a simple historical fact. The psalmist is not suggesting that he was conceived through an inappropriate sexual relationship (although the verse has sometimes been understood to mean that, or even that <i>all</i> sexual relationships are sinful). The psalmist's point is that he has been a sinner from the very moment his personal existence began. By going back beyond the time of birth to the moment of conception, the psalmist makes his point more emphatically in the second line than in the first.<br>

The psalmist uses the language and imagery of such rites to describe spiritual cleansing through forgiveness.<br>

The language is metonymic: the effect of forgiveness (joy) has been substituted for its cause. The psalmist probably alludes here to an assuring word from God announcing that his sins are forgiven (a so-called oracle of forgiveness). The imperfect verbal form is used here to express the psalmist's wish or request. The synonyms "happiness" and "joy" are joined together to emphasize the degree of joy he anticipates.<br>

The psalmist expresses his fear that, due to his sin, God will take away the Holy Spirit from him. NT believers enjoy the permanent gift of the Holy Spirit and need not make such a request nor fear such a consequence. However, in the OT God's Spirit empowered certain individuals for special tasks and only temporarily resided in them. For example, when God rejected Saul as king and chose David to replace him, the divine Spirit left Saul and came upon David (1 Sam 16:13-14).<br>

God's "ways" are sometimes his commands, but in this context, where the teaching of God's ways motivates repentance (see the next line), it is more likely that God's merciful and compassionate way of dealing with sinners is in view. Thanksgiving songs praising God for his deliverance typically focus on these divine attributes (see Pss 34, 41, 116, 138).<br>

Another option is to take the prefixed verbal form as a jussive, "may my tongue shout for joy." However, the pattern in vv. 12-15 appears to be prayer/request (see vv. 12, 14a, 15a) followed by promise/vow (see vv. 13, 14b, 15b).<br>

(Some translations that consider the particle asseverative leave it untranslated.) If taken as causal or explanatory ("for", cf.

 <a name="fn1922" href="psa.htm#fnB1922"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (51:16)  The translation assumes that the cohortative is used in a hypothetical manner in a formally unmarked conditional sentence, "You do not want a sacrifice, should I offer [it]" (cf.

This is not a categorical denial of the sacrificial system in general or of the importance of such offerings. The psalmist is talking about his specific situation. Dedication and communion offerings have their proper place in worship (see v. 21), but God requires something more fundamental, a repentant and humble attitude (see v. 17), before these offerings can have real meaning.<br>

Ps 14:1 has <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlylu</FONT> ("a deed") instead of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lwu</FONT> ("injustice"). The verbs describe the typical behavior of the wicked. The subject of the plural verbs is "sons of man" (v. 2). The entire human race is characterized by sinful behavior. This practical atheism--living as if there is no God who will hold them accountable for their actions--makes them fools, for one of the earmarks of folly is to fail to anticipate the long range consequences of one's behavior.<br>

The rhetorical question expresses the psalmist's amazement at their apparent lack of understanding.

 <a name="fn1973" href="psa.htm#fnB1973"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (53:5)  <i>Heb</i> "there they are afraid [with] fear." The perfect verbal form is probably used in a rhetorical manner; the psalmist describes the future demise of the oppressors as if it were already occurring. The adverb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v</FONT> ("there") is also used here for dramatic effect, as the psalmist envisions the wicked standing in fear at a spot that is this vivid in his imagination (see BDB 1027). The cognate accusative following the verb emphasizes the degree of their terror ("absolutely").<br>
 <a name="fn1974" href="psa.htm#fnB1974"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (53:5)  <i>Heb</i> "there is no fear."

 <a name="fn1975" href="psa.htm#fnB1975"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (53:5)  <i>Heb</i> "scatters the bones." The perfect is used in a rhetorical manner, describing this future judgment as if it were already accomplished. Scattering the bones alludes to the aftermath of a battle.

An Arabic cognate means "to be out of one's senses, to wander about" (<i>HALOT</i> 242). With the <i>vav</i> conjunctive prefixed to it, the cohortative probably indicates the result or effect of the preceding main verb. Some prefer to emend the form to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*oha@w+</FONT>, a Niphal of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;wh</FONT>, or to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm#h^a#w+</FONT>, a Qal imperfect from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmh</FONT> ("to moan").

Here in Ps 55:3 it is preferable to read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wryf!m=y~</FONT> ("they rain down"). It is odd for "rain down" to be used with an abstract object like "wickedness," but in Job 20:23 God "rains down" anger (unless one emends the text there; see <i>BHS</i>).<br>

 <a name="fn2028" href="psa.htm#fnB2028"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tc</b> (55:15)  The meaning of the MT is unclear. The Kethib (consonantal text) reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wmylu twmyvy</FONT> ("May devastation [be] upon them!"). The proposed noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twmyvy</FONT> occurs only here and perhaps in the place name Beth-Jeshimoth in Num 33:49 (see <i>HALOT</i> 447). The Qere (marginal text) has <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wmylu twm yvy</FONT>. The verbal form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yV!y~</FONT> is apparently an alternate form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ayV!y~</FONT>, a Hiphil imperfect from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">avn</FONT> ("deceive"). In this case one might read "death will come deceptively upon them." This reading has the advantage of reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twm</FONT> ("death") which forms a natural parallel with "Sheol" in the next line. The present translation is based on the following reconstruction of the text: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tw\m* &lt;M@v!y+</FONT>. The verb assumed in the reconstruction is a Hiphil jussive third masculine singular from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;mv</FONT> ("be desolate") with a third masculine plural pronominal suffix attached. This reconstruction assumes that (1) haplography has occurred in the traditional text (the original sequence of three <i>mems</i> was lost with only one <i>mem</i> remaining), resulting in the fusion of originally distinct forms in the Kethib, and (2) that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wmylu</FONT> ("upon them") is a later scribal addition attempting to make sense of a garbled and corrupt text. The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu</FONT> does occur with the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;mv</FONT>, but in such cases the expression means "be appalled at/because of" (see Jer 49:20; 50:45). If one were to retain the prepositional phrase here, one would have to read the text as follows: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wmylu twm &lt;yV!y~</FONT> ("Death will be appalled at them"). The idea seems odd, to say the least. Death is not collocated with this verb elsewhere.<br>

However, in this case "his mouth" does not agree in number with the plural verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wqlj</FONT> ("they are smooth"). Therefore some further propose an emendation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wyp</FONT> ("his mouth") to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wynp</FONT> ("his face"). In any case, the point seems to that the psalmist's former friend spoke kindly to him and gave the outward indications of friendship.<br>

Such a translation assumes that the prepositional phrase "in God" goes with the following verb "I boast" (see Ps 44:8) and that "his word" is appositional to "in God" and more specifically identifies the basis for the psalmist's confidence. God's "word" is here understood as an assuring promise of protection. Another option (2) is to translate, "in God I will boast [with] a word." In this case, the "word" is a song of praise. (In this view the pronominal suffix "his" must be omitted as in v. 10.) The present translation reflects yet another option (3): In this case "I praise his word" is a parenthetical statement, with "his word" being the object of the verb.

(1) One could translate, "in God I will boast [with] a word." In this case, the "word" refers to a song of praise. (2) If one assumes that God's word is in view, as in v. 4, then one option is to translate, "in God I boast, [in] his word." In this case the prepositional phrase "in God" goes with the following verb "I boast" (see Ps 44:8) and "[his] word" is appositional to "in God" and more specifically identifies the basis for the psalmist's confidence. God's "word" is here understood as an assuring promise of protection. (3) The present translation reflects another option: In this case "I praise [his] word" is a parenthetical statement, with "[his] word" being the object of the verb.

The prefixed verbal forms are understood as jussives expressing the psalmist's prayer. The second verb, which has a <i>vav</i> conjunctive prefixed to it, probably indicates purpose. Another option is to take the forms as imperfects expressing confidence, "he will send from heaven and deliver me" (cf. NRSV). <br>
 <a name="fn2101" href="psa.htm#fnB2101"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (57:3)  <i>Heb</i> "he hurls insults, one who crushes me." The translation assumes that this line identifies those from whom the psalmist seeks deliverance. (The singular is representative; the psalmist is surrounded by enemies, see v. 4.) Another option is to understand God as the subject of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[rj</FONT>, which could then be taken as a homonym of the more common root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[rj</FONT> ("insult") meaning "confuse."

According to DHS (p 92, para 65, Rem 5) the cohortative is used here "to express an action which one resigns himself to do, though under external pressure." Others disagree, however, arguing that the form here is a "pseudo-cohortative" used here in a gnomic sense (<i>IBHS</i> 576-77).<br>
 <a name="fn2103" href="psa.htm#fnB2103"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (57:4)  The Hebrew verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">fhl</FONT> is here understood as a <i>hapax legomenon</i> meaning "devour" (see <i>HALOT</i> 521), a homonym of the more common verb meaning "to burn." A more traditional interpretation takes the verb from this latter root and translates, "those who are aflame" (see BDB 529; cf. NASB "those who breathe forth fire").<br>

The syntax of the verse is difficult. Another option is to take "my life" with the preceding verse. For this to make sense, one must add a verb, perhaps "and may he deliver" (cf. the LXX), before the phrase. One might then translate, "May God send his loyal love and faithfulness and deliver my life." If one does take "my life" with v. 4, then the parallelism of v. 5 is altered and one might translate: "in the midst of lions I lie down, [among] men who want to devour me, whose teeth...."<br>

Like the heart, the liver is viewed as the seat of one's emotions. See also Pss 16:9; 30:12; 108:1, as well as H. W. Wolff, <i>Anthropology of the Old Testament</i>, 64, and M.

Elsewhere the collocation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rbd</FONT> ("speak") with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qdx</FONT> ("what is right") as object means "to speak the truth" (see Ps 52:3; Isa 45:19). Here it refers specifically to declaring what is right in a legal setting, as the next line indicates.<br>
 <a name="fn2122" href="psa.htm#fnB2122"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (58:1)  <i>Heb</i> "the sons of mankind." The translation assumes the phrase is the object of the verb "to judge." Some take it as a vocative, "Do you judge fairly, O sons of mankind?" (Cf. NASB; see Ezek 20:4; 22:2; 23:36.)<br>
 <a name="fn2123" href="psa.htm#fnB2123"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (58:2)  The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[a</FONT> ("no") is used here as a strong adversative emphasizing the following statement, which contrasts reality with the rulers' claim alluded to in the rhetorical questions (see BDB 65 and Ps 44:9).<br>
 <a name="fn2124" href="psa.htm#fnB2124"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (58:2)  <i>Heb</i> "in the heart unjust deeds you do." The phrase "in the heart" (i.e., "mind") seems to refer to their plans and motives. The Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hl*w+u^</FONT> ("injustice") is collocated with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lup</FONT> ("do") here and in Job 36:23 and Ps 119:3. Some emend the plural form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tlwu</FONT> ("unjust deeds"; see Ps 64:6) to the singular <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lw\u*</FONT> ("injustice"; see Job 34:32), taking the final <i>tav</i> as dittographic (note that the following verbal form begins with <i>tav</i>). Some then understand <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lw\u*</FONT> ("injustice") as a genitive modifying "heart" and translate, "with a heart of injustice you act."<br>
 <a name="fn2125" href="psa.htm#fnB2125"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (58:2)  <i>Heb</i> "in the earth the violence of your hands you weigh out." The imagery is from the economic realm. The addressees measure out violence, rather than justice, and distribute it like a commodity. This may be ironic, since justice was sometimes viewed as a measuring scale (see Job 31:6).<br>

 <a name="fn2130" href="psa.htm#fnB2130"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (58:4)  <i>Heb</i> "[that] stops up its ear." The apparent Hiphil jussive verbal form should be understood as a Qal imperfect with "i" theme vowel (see GKC &#167;63.<i>n</i>).<br>

 <a name="fn2133" href="psa.htm#fnB2133"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (58:7)  Following the imperatival forms in v. 6, the prefixed verbal form is understood as a jussive expressing the psalmist's wish. Another option is to take the form as an imperfect (indicative) and translate, "they will scatter" (see v. 9). The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">sam</FONT> (which is a homonym of the more common <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">sam</FONT>, "to refuse, reject") appears only here and in Job 7:5, where it is used of a festering wound from which fluid runs or flows.<br>
 <a name="fn2134" href="psa.htm#fnB2134"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (58:7)  <i>Heb</i> "like water, they go about for themselves." The translation assumes that the phrase "they go about for themselves" is an implied relative clause modifying "water." Another option is to take the clause as independent and parallel to what precedes. In this case the enemies would be the subject and the verb could be taken as jussive, "let them wander about."<br>
 <a name="fn2135" href="psa.htm#fnB2135"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tc</b> (58:7)  The syntax of the Hebrew text is difficult and the meaning uncertain. The text reads literally, "he treads his arrows (following the Qere; Kethib has "his arrow"), like they are cut off/dry up." It is not clear if the verbal root is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">llm</FONT>, "circumcise" (BDB, 576) or the homonymic <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">llm</FONT>, "wither" (KB, 593-94). Since the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">llm</FONT>, "to wither," is used of vegetation, it is possible that the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ryxj</FONT>, "grass" (which is visually similar to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wyxj</FONT>, "his arrows") originally appeared in the text. The translation above assumes that the text originally was <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wllmty ryxj wmk</FONT>, "like grass let them wither." If original, it could have been accidentally corrupted to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wllmty wmk wxj</FONT>, "his arrow(s) like they dry up," with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ird</FONT>, "to tread," being added later in an effort to make sense of "his arrow(s)."  <br>
 <a name="fn2136" href="psa.htm#fnB2136"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (58:8)  There is no "to be" verb in the Hebrew text at this point, but a jussive tone can be assumed based on vv. 6-7.<br>
 <a name="fn2137" href="psa.htm#fnB2137"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (58:8)  <i>Heb</i> "like a melting snail [that] moves along." A. Cohen (<i>Psalms</i>, Soncino Books of the Bible, 184) explains that the text here alludes "to the popular belief that the slimy trail which the snail leaves in its track is the dissolution of its substance."<br>
 <a name="fn2138" href="psa.htm#fnB2138"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (58:8)  The words "let them be like" are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons. The jussive mood is implied from the preceding context, and "like" is understood by ellipsis (see the previous line).<br>
 <a name="fn2139" href="psa.htm#fnB2139"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (58:8)  This rare word also appears in Job 3:16 and Eccles 6:3.<br>

 <a name="fn2141" href="psa.htm#fnB2141"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (58:9)  Apparently God (v. 6) is the subject of the verb here.<br>
 <a name="fn2142" href="psa.htm#fnB2142"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (58:9)  <i>Heb</i> "like living, like burning anger he will sweep it away." The meaning of the text is unclear. The translation assumes that within the cooking metaphor (see the previous line) <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yj</FONT> ("living") refers here to raw meat (as in 1 Sam 2:15, where it modifies <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rcb</FONT> ["flesh"]) and that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/wrj</FONT> (which always refers to God's "burning anger" elsewhere) here refers to food that is cooked. (Another option is to emend the form to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rwrj</FONT> ["burned."]) The pronominal suffix on the verb "sweep away" apparently refers back to the "thorns" of the preceding line. The image depicts swift and sudden judgment. Before the fire has been adequately kindled and all the meat cooked, the winds of judgment will sweep away everything in their path.<br>
 <a name="fn2143" href="psa.htm#fnB2143"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (58:10)  The singular is representative here, as is the singular from "wicked" in the next line.<br>
 <a name="fn2144" href="psa.htm#fnB2144"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (58:11)  Following the imperfects of v. 10, the prefixed verbal form with <i>vav</i> conjunctive probably indicates a result or consequence of what precedes.<br>

 <a name="fn2147" href="psa.htm#fnB2147"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (58:11)  The plural participle is unusual here if the preceding <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yhla</FONT> is here a plural of majesty, referring to the one true God. Occasionally the plural of majesty does take a plural attributive (see GKC &#167;132.<i>h</i>). It is possible that the final <i>mem</i> on the participle is enclitic, and that it was later misunderstood as a plural ending. Another option is to translate, "Yes indeed, there are gods who judge in the earth." In this case, the statement reflects the polytheistic mindset of pagan observers who, despite their theological ignorance, nevertheless recognize divine retribution when they see it.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (58:11)  According to the superscription, David wrote this psalm on the occasion when Saul sent assassins to surround David's house and kill him in the morning (see 1 Sam 19:11). However, the psalm itself mentions foreign enemies (vv. 5, 8). Perhaps these references reflect a later adaptation of an original Davidic psalm.<br>

It is unusual for this adverb to follow a negated verb. Some see this as qualifying the assertion to some degree, but this would water down the affirmation too much (see v. 6b, where the adverb is omitted). If the adverb has a qualifying function, it would suggest that the psalmist might be upended, though not severely. This is inconsistent with the confident mood of the psalm.

The phrases "sons of mankind" and "sons of man" also appear together in Ps 49:2.

This is a numerical saying utilizing the "x" followed by "x + 1" pattern to facilitate poetic parallelism. (See W. M. W. Roth, <i>Numerical Sayings in the Old Testament</i>, 55-56.) As is typical in such sayings, a list corresponding to the second number (in this case "two") follows. Another option is to translate, "God has spoken once, twice [he has spoken] that which I have heard." The terms <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tja</FONT> ("one; once") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ytv</FONT> ("two; twice") are also juxtaposed in 2 Kgs 6:10 (where they refer to an action that was done more than "once or twice") and in Job 33:14 (where they refer to God speaking "one way" and then in "another manner").<br>

 <a name="fn2304" href="psa.htm#fnB2304"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (64:6)  <i>Heb</i> "search out, examine," which here means (by metonymy) "devise."<br>
 <a name="fn2305" href="psa.htm#fnB2305"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tc</b> (64:6)  The MT has <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wnmt</FONT> ("we are finished"), a Qal perfect first common plural form from the verbal root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;mt</FONT>. Some understand this as the beginning of a quotation of the enemies' words and translate, "we have completed," but the Hiphil would seem to be required in this case. The present translation follows many medieval Hebrew MSS in reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wnmf</FONT> ("they hide"), a Qal perfect third common plural form from the verbal root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/mf</FONT>.<br>
 <a name="fn2306" href="psa.htm#fnB2306"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (64:6)  <i>Heb</i> "a searched-out search," which is understood as referring here to a thoroughly planned plot to destroy the psalmist.<br>
 <a name="fn2307" href="psa.htm#fnB2307"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (64:6)  <i>Heb</i> "and the inner part of man, and a heart [is] deep." The point seems to be that a man's inner thoughts are incapable of being discovered. No one is a mind reader! Consequently the psalmist is vulnerable to his enemies' well-disguised plots.<br>
 <a name="fn2308" href="psa.htm#fnB2308"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (64:7)  The prefixed verb with <i>vav</i> consecutive is normally used in narrative contexts to describe completed past actions. It is possible that the conclusion to the psalm (vv. 7-10) was added to the lament after God's judgment of the wicked in response to the psalmist's lament (vv. 1-6). The translation assumes that these verses are anticipatory and express the psalmist's confidence that God would eventually judge the wicked. The psalmist uses a narrative style as a rhetorical device to emphasize his certitude. See GKC &#167;111.<i>w</i> and <i>DHS</i> <b>&#167;</b>49.b.<br>
 <a name="fn2309" href="psa.htm#fnB2309"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (64:7)  The perfect verbal form here expresses the psalmist's certitude about the coming demise of the wicked.<br>
 <a name="fn2310" href="psa.htm#fnB2310"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (64:7)  The translation follows the traditional accentuation of the MT. Another option is to translate, "But God will shoot them down with an arrow, suddenly they will be wounded" (cf. NIV, NRSV).<br>
 <a name="fn2311" href="psa.htm#fnB2311"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tc</b> (64:8)  The MT reads literally, "and they caused him to stumble, upon them, their tongue." Perhaps the third plural subject of the verb is indefinite with the third singular pronominal suffix on the verb being distributive (see Ps 63:10). In this case one may translate, "each one will be made to stumble." The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu</FONT> might then be taken as adversative, "against them [is] their tongue." Many prefer to emend the text to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;nwvl ylu wmlyvkyw</FONT> ("and he caused them to stumble over their tongue"). However, if this reading is original, it is difficult to see how the present reading of the MT arose. Furthermore, the preposition is not collocated with the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lvk</FONT> elsewhere. It is likely that the MT is corrupt, but a satisfying emendation has not yet been proposed.<br>
 <a name="fn2312" href="psa.htm#fnB2312"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (64:8)  The Hitpolel verbal form is probably from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dwn</FONT> (see <i>HALOT</i> 678), which is attested elsewhere in the Hitpolel stem, not the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ddn</FONT> (as proposed by BDB 622), which does not occur elsewhere in this stem.<br>
 <a name="fn2313" href="psa.htm#fnB2313"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tc</b> (64:9)  Many medieval Hebrew MSS read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">waryw</FONT> ("and they will see") instead of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">waryyw</FONT> ("and they will proclaim").<br>
 <a name="fn2314" href="psa.htm#fnB2314"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (64:9)  <i>Heb</i> "the work of God," referring to the judgment described in v. 7.<br>

 <a name="fn2318" href="psa.htm#fnB2318"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (65:1)  <i>Heb</i> "for you, silence, praise." Many prefer to emend the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hY&#180;m!D%</FONT> ("silence") to a participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hY&#180;m!oD</FONT>, from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmd</FONT> ("be silent"), understood here in the sense of "wait" (see <i>HALOT</i> 217, 225).<br>

 <a name="fn2323" href="psa.htm#fnB2323"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (65:4)  The Hebrew noun is an abstract plural. The word often refers metonymically to the happiness that God-given security and prosperity produce (see Pss 1:1; 2:12; 34:9; 41:1; 84:12; 89:15; 106:3; 112:1; 127:5; 128:1; 144:15).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (65:5)  <i>All the ends of the earth trust in you</i>. This idealistic portrayal of universal worship is typical hymnic hyperbole, though it does anticipate eschatological reality.<br>
 <a name="fn2328" href="psa.htm#fnB2328"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tc</b> (65:5)  <i>Heb</i> "and [the] distant sea." The plural adjective is problematic after the singular form "sea." One could emend <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;y</FONT> ("sea") to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ymy</FONT> ("seas"), or emend the plural form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yqjr</FONT> ("far") to the singular <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qjr</FONT>. In this case the final <i>mem</i> could be treated as dittographic; note the <i>mem</i> on the beginning of the first word in v. 6.<br>
 <a name="fn2329" href="psa.htm#fnB2329"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (65:6)  <i>Heb</i> "[the] one who establishes [the] mountains by his power."<br>

 <a name="fn2332" href="psa.htm#fnB2332"><sup>15</sup></a><b>sn</b> (65:7)  <i>The raging seas...the commotion made by the nations</i>. The raging seas symbolize the turbulent nations of the earth (see Ps 46:2-3, 6; Isa 17:12).<br>
 <a name="fn2333" href="psa.htm#fnB2333"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (65:8)  <i>Heb</i> "and the inhabitants of the ends fear because of your signs." God's "signs" are the "awesome acts" (see v. 5) he performs in the earth.<br>
 <a name="fn2334" href="psa.htm#fnB2334"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (65:8)  <i>Heb</i> "the goings out of the morning and the evening you cause to shout for joy." The phrase "goings out of the morning and evening" refers to the sunrise and sunset, that is, the east and the west (see BDB 425).<br>
 <a name="fn2335" href="psa.htm#fnB2335"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (65:9)  The verb form is a Polel from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qwv</FONT> ("be abundant"; BDB 1003), a verb which appears only here and in Joel 2:24 and 3:13, where it is used in the Hiphil stem and means "overflow."<br>

 <a name="fn2337" href="psa.htm#fnB2337"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (65:9)  <i>Heb</i> "[with] a channel of God full of water." The divine name is probably used here in a superlative sense to depict a very deep stream ("a stream fit for God," as it were).<br>
 <a name="fn2338" href="psa.htm#fnB2338"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (65:9)  The pronoun apparently refers to the people of the earth, mentioned in v. 8.<br>
 <a name="fn2339" href="psa.htm#fnB2339"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (65:9)  <i>Heb</i> "for thus [referring to the provision of rain described in the first half of the verse] you prepare it." The third feminine singular pronominal suffix attached to the verb "prepare" refers back to the "earth," which is a feminine noun with regard to grammatical form.<br>
 <a name="fn2340" href="psa.htm#fnB2340"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (65:10)  <i>Heb</i> "saturating" [the form is an infinitive absolute].<br>

 <a name="fn2344" href="psa.htm#fnB2344"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (65:10)  <i>Heb</i> "its vegetation you bless." Divine "blessing" often involves an object with special power or capacity (see <i>HALOT</i> 160).<br>

 <a name="fn2352" href="psa.htm#fnB2352"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (66:3)  See Deut 33:29; Ps 81:15 for other uses of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vjk</FONT> in the sense "cower in fear." In Ps 18:44 the verb seems to carry the nuance "be weak, powerless" (see also Ps 109:24).<br>
 <a name="fn2353" href="psa.htm#fnB2353"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (66:4)  Or "bows down to." The prefixed verbal forms in v. 4 are taken (1) as imperfects expressing what is typical. Another option (2) is to interpret them as anticipatory ("all the earth will worship you") or (3) take them as jussives, expressing a prayer or wish ("may all the earth worship you").<br>
 <a name="fn2354" href="psa.htm#fnB2354"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (66:5)  Or "see."<br>

 <a name="fn2356" href="psa.htm#fnB2356"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (66:5)  <i>Heb</i> "awesome [is] an act toward the sons of man." It is unclear how the prepositional phrase relates to what precedes. If collocated with "act," it may mean "on behalf of" or "toward." If taken with "awesome" (see 1 Chr 16:25; Pss 89:7; 96:4; Zeph 2:11), one might translate "his awesome acts are beyond human comprehension" or "his awesome acts are superior to anything men can do."<br>
 <a name="fn2357" href="psa.htm#fnB2357"><sup>8</sup></a><b>sn</b> (66:6)  <i>He turned the sea into dry land</i>. The psalmist alludes to Israel's crossing the Red Sea (Exod 14:21).<br>
 <a name="fn2358" href="psa.htm#fnB2358"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (66:6)  Because of the reference to "the river," some understand this as an allusion to Israel's crossing the Jordan River. However, the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rhn</FONT> does not always refer to a "river" in the technical sense; it can be used of sea currents (see Jon 2:4). So this line may also refer to the Red Sea crossing (cf. NEB).<br>
 <a name="fn2359" href="psa.htm#fnB2359"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (66:6)  The adverb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v</FONT> ("there") is used here, as often in poetic texts, to point "to a spot in which a scene is localized vividly in the imagination" (BDB 1027).<br>

 <a name="fn2362" href="psa.htm#fnB2362"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (66:7)  The verb form is jussive (note the negative particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la</FONT>). The Kethib (consonantal text) has a Hiphil form of the verb, apparently to be understood in an exhibitive sense ("demonstrate stubborn rebellion," see BDB 927), while the Qere (marginal reading) has a Qal form, to be understood in an intransitive sense. The preposition -<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l</FONT> with pronominal suffix should be understood in a reflexive sense ("for themselves") and indicates that the action is performed with the interest of the subject in mind (see BDB 515-16).<br>
 <a name="fn2363" href="psa.htm#fnB2363"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (66:8)  <i>Heb</i> "bless," in the sense of declaring "God to be the source of...special power" (see <i>HALOT</i> 160).<br>

The infinitive with -<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l</FONT> expresses purpose/result. When God demonstrates his favor to his people, all nations will recognize his character as a God who delivers.

The imperfects are translated with the present tense because the statement is understood as a generalization about God's providential control of the world.

 <a name="fn2386" href="psa.htm#fnB2386"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (67:5)  <i>Heb</i> "let the nations, all of them, thank you." The prefixed verbal forms in v. 5 are understood as jussives in this call to praise.<br>

 <a name="fn2396" href="psa.htm#fnB2396"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:4)  Traditionally the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twbru</FONT> is taken as "steppe-lands" (often rendered "deserts"), but here the form is probably a homonym meaning "clouds" (see <i>HALOT</i> 879). Verse 33, which depicts God as the one who "rides on the sky" strongly favors this (see as well Deut 33:26), as does the reference in v. 9 to God as the source of rain. The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbru</FONT> ("cloud") is cognate with Akkadian <i>urpatu/erpetu</i> and with Ugaritic <i>&#180;rpt</i>. The phrase <i>rkb &#180;rpt</i>, "one who rides on the clouds," appears in Ugaritic mythological texts as an epithet of the storm god Baal. The non-phonemic interchange of the bilabial consonants <i>b</i> and <i>p</i> is attested elsewhere in roots common to Hebrew and Ugaritic, though the phenomenon is relatively rare.<br>
 <a name="fn2397" href="psa.htm#fnB2397"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tc</b> (68:4)  <i>Heb</i> "in the LORD his name." If the MT is retained, the preposition -<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">b</FONT> is introducing the predicate (the so-called <i>bet</i> of identity), "the LORD is his name" (see BDB 88). However, some prefer to emend the text to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wmv hy yk</FONT> ("for Yah is his name"). This emendation, reflected in the present translation, assumes a confusion of <i>bet</i> and <i>kaf</i> and haplography of <i>yod</i>.<br>
 <a name="fn2398" href="psa.htm#fnB2398"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (68:5)  God is depicted here as a just ruler. In the ancient Near Eastern world a king was responsible for promoting justice, including caring for the weak and vulnerable, epitomized by the <i>fatherless</i> and <i>widows</i>.<br>
 <a name="fn2399" href="psa.htm#fnB2399"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:5)  <i>Heb</i> "God [is] in his holy dwelling place." He occupies his throne and carries out his royal responsibilities.<br>
 <a name="fn2400" href="psa.htm#fnB2400"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:6)  <i>Heb</i> "God causes the solitary ones to dwell in a house." The participle suggests this is what God typically does.<br>
 <a name="fn2401" href="psa.htm#fnB2401"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:6)  <i>Heb</i> "he brings out prisoners into prosperity." Another option is to translate, "he brings out prisoners with singing" (cf. NIV). The participle suggests this is what God typically does.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (68:6)  God delivers the downtrodden and oppressed, but <i>sinful rebels</i> who oppose his reign are treated appropriately.<br>
 <a name="fn2403" href="psa.htm#fnB2403"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:7)  <i>Heb</i> "when you go out before your people." The Hebrew idiom "go out before" is used here in a militaristic sense of leading troops into battle (see Judg 4:14; 9:39; 2 Sam 5:24).<br>
 <a name="fn2404" href="psa.htm#fnB2404"><sup>15</sup></a><b>sn</b> (68:7)  <i>When you march through the desert</i>. Some interpreters think that v. 7 alludes to Israel's exodus from Egypt and its subsequent travels in the desert. Another option is that v. 7, like v. 8, echoes Judg 5:4, which describes how the God of Sinai marched across the desert regions to do battle with Sisera and his Canaanite army.<br>
 <a name="fn2405" href="psa.htm#fnB2405"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:8)  <i>Heb</i> "this one of Sinai." The phrase is a divine title, perhaps indicating that the LORD rules from Sinai.<br>
 <a name="fn2406" href="psa.htm#fnB2406"><sup>17</sup></a><b>sn</b> (68:8)  The language of vv. 7-8 is reminiscent of Judg 5:4-5, which tells how the God of Sinai came in the storm and annihilated the Canaanite forces led by Sisera. The presence of allusion does not mean, however, that this is a purely historical reference. The psalmist is describing God's typical appearance as a warrior in terms of his prior self-revelation as ancient events are reactualized in the psalmist's experience. (For a similar literary technique, see Hab 3.)<br>
 <a name="fn2407" href="psa.htm#fnB2407"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:9)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[wn</FONT> ("cause rain to fall") is a homonym of the more common <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[wn</FONT> ("brandish"; see <i>HALOT</i> 682).<br>
 <a name="fn2408" href="psa.htm#fnB2408"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:9)  <i>Heb</i> "[on] your inheritance." This refers to Israel as God's specially chosen people (see Pss 28:9; 33:12; 74:2; 78:62, 71; 79:1; 94:5, 14; 106:40). Some take "your inheritance" with what follows, but the <i>vav</i> prefixed to the following word (note <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">halnw</FONT>) makes this syntactically unlikely.<br>
 <a name="fn2409" href="psa.htm#fnB2409"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:9)  <i>Heb</i> "it [is]," referring to God's "inheritance."<br>
 <a name="fn2410" href="psa.htm#fnB2410"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:9)  <i>Heb</i> "it," referring to God's "inheritance."<br>
 <a name="fn2411" href="psa.htm#fnB2411"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:10)  The meaning of the Hebrew text is unclear; it appears to read, "your animals, they live in it," but this makes little, if any, sense in this context. Some suggest that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hyj</FONT> is a rare homonym here, meaning "community" (BDB 312) or "dwelling place" (<i>HALOT</i> 310). In this case one may take "your community/dwelling place" as appositional to the third feminine singular pronominal suffix at the end of v. 9, the antecedent of which is "your inheritance." The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Hb-wbvy</FONT> ("they live in it") may then be understood as an asyndetic relative clause modifying "your community/dwelling place." A literal translation of vv. 9b-10a would be, "when it [your inheritance] is tired, you sustain it, your community/dwelling place in [which] they live."<br>
 <a name="fn2412" href="psa.htm#fnB2412"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:11)  <i>Heb</i> "gives a word." Perhaps this refers to a divine royal decree or battle cry.<br>
 <a name="fn2413" href="psa.htm#fnB2413"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:11)  <i>Heb</i> "the ones spreading the good news [are] a large army." The participle translated "the ones spreading the good news" is a feminine plural form. Apparently the good news here is the announcement that enemy kings have been defeated (see v. 12).<br>
 <a name="fn2414" href="psa.htm#fnB2414"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:12)  The verbal repetition draws attention to the statement.<br>
 <a name="fn2415" href="psa.htm#fnB2415"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:12)  The Hebrew form appears to be the construct of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwn</FONT> ("pasture") but the phrase "pasture of the house" makes no sense here. The translation assumes that the form is an alternative or corruption of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwxn</FONT> ("beautiful woman"; see <i>HALOT</i> 679). A reference to a woman would be appropriate in light of v. 11b.<br>
 <a name="fn2416" href="psa.htm#fnB2416"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:13)  Or "if."<br>
 <a name="fn2417" href="psa.htm#fnB2417"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:13)  The meaning of the Hebrew word translated "sheepfolds" is uncertain. There may be an echo of Judg 5:16 here.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (68:13)  The point of the imagery of v. 13 is not certain, though the reference to <i>silver</i> and <i>gold</i> appears to be positive. Both would be part of the loot carried away from battle (see v. 12b).<br>
 <a name="fn2419" href="psa.htm#fnB2419"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:14)  The divine name used here is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yD~v^</FONT> ("Shaddai"). Shaddai/El Shaddai is the sovereign king/judge of the world who grants life, blesses and kills, and judges. In Genesis he blesses the patriarchs with fertility and promises numerous descendants. Outside Genesis he both blesses (protects) and takes away life and/or happiness.<br>
 <a name="fn2420" href="psa.htm#fnB2420"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:14)  The Hebrew text adds "in it." The third feminine singular pronominal suffix may refer back to God's community/dwelling place (v. 10).<br>
 <a name="fn2421" href="psa.htm#fnB2421"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:14)  The verb form appears to be a Hiphil jussive from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">glv</FONT>, which is usually understood as a denominative verb from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gl#v#</FONT> ("snow") with an indefinite subject (see BDB 1017). The form could be taken as a preterite, in which case one might translate, "when the sovereign judge scattered kings, it snowed on Zalmon" (cf. NIV, NRSV). The point of the image is unclear. Perhaps "snow" suggests fertility and blessing (see v. 9 and Isa 55:10), or the image of a snow-capped mountain suggests grandeur.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (68:14)  <i>Zalmon </i>was apparently a mountain in the region, perhaps the one mentioned in Judg 9:46 as being in the vicinity of Shechem.<br>
 <a name="fn2422" href="psa.htm#fnB2422"><sup>33</sup></a><b>sn</b> (68:15)  The <i>mountain of Bashan</i> probably refers to Mount Hermon.<br>
 <a name="fn2423" href="psa.htm#fnB2423"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:15)  <i>Heb</i> "a mountain of God." The divine name is probably used here in a superlative sense to depict a very high mountain ("a mountain fit for God," as it were). Cf. NIV "are majestic mountains"; NRSV "O mighty mountain."<br>
 <a name="fn2424" href="psa.htm#fnB2424"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:15)  The meaning of the Hebrew term, which appears only here in the OT, is uncertain. <i>HALOT</i> 174 suggests "many-peaked," while BDB 148 suggests "rounded summit."<br>

 <a name="fn2426" href="psa.htm#fnB2426"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:16)  Perhaps the apparent plural form should be read as a singular with enclitic <i>mem</i> (later misinterpreted as a plural ending). The preceding verse has the singular form.<br>

 <a name="fn2431" href="psa.htm#fnB2431"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tc</b> (68:17)  The MT reads, "the sovereign Master [is] among them, Sinai, in holiness," which is syntactically difficult.

 <a name="fn2436" href="psa.htm#fnB2436"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (68:18)  <i>Heb</i> "so that the LORD God might live [there]." Many take the infinitive construct with -<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l</FONT> as indicating purpose here, but it is unclear how the offering of tribute enables the Lord to live in Zion. This may an occurrence of the relatively rare emphatic <i>lamed</i> (see <i>HALOT</i> 510-11, though this text is not listed as an example there). If so, the statement corresponds nicely to the final line of v. 16, which also affirms emphatically that the Lord lives in Zion.<br>

In some cases it is apparent that scolding or threatening is in view (see Gen 37:10; Ruth 2:16; Zech 3:2). However, in militaristic contexts such as Ps 68 this translation is inadequate, for the verb refers in this setting to the warrior's battle cry, which terrifies and paralyzes the enemy. See <i>TDOT</i> 3:53, and note the use of the verb in Ps 106:9 and Nah 1:4, as well as the related noun in Job 26:11; Pss 18:15; 76:6; 104:7; Isa 50:2; 51:20; 66:15.<br>

The Hitpael of this verb appears only here and in Prov 6:3, where it seems to mean, "humble oneself," a nuance that fits nicely in this context. The apparent subject is "wild beast" or "assembly," though both of these nouns are grammatically feminine, while the participle is a masculine form. Perhaps one should emend the participial form to a masculine plural (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;sprtm</FONT>) and understand "bulls" or "calves" as the subject.<br>

The plural of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;wlv</FONT> ("peace") is used in Ps 55:20 of one's "friends." If the reading of the MT is retained here, the term depicts the psalmist's enemies as a close-knit group of friends who are bound together by their hatred for the psalmist. Some prefer to revocalize the text as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ym!WLv!luW</FONT> ("and for retribution"). In this case the noun stands parallel to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jp</FONT> ("trap") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vqwm</FONT> ("snare"), and one might translate, "may their dining table become a trap before them, [a means of] retribution and a snare" (cf.

 <b>sn</b> (69:28)  The phrase <i>the scroll listing the living</i> (<i>Heb </i>"scroll of life") occurs only here in the OT. It pictures a scroll or census list containing the names of the citizens of a community. When an individual dies, that person's name is wiped out of the list.

The basic sense of the word "holy" is "set apart from that which is commonplace, special, unique." The LORD's holiness is first and foremost his transcendent sovereignty as the ruler of the world. He is "set apart" from the world over which he rules. At the same time his holiness encompasses his moral authority, which derives from his royal position. As king he has the right to dictate to his subjects how they are to live; indeed his very own character sets the standard for proper behavior. See the notes on Isa 6:3.<br>

 <a name="fn2589" href="psa.htm#fnB2589"><sup>41</sup></a><b>sn</b> (71:24)  <i>Psalm 72</i>. This royal psalm contains a prayer for the Davidic king (note the imperatival form in v. 1 and the jussive forms in vv. 16-17). It is not entirely clear if vv. 2-15 express a prayer or anticipate a future reign. The translation assumes a blend of petition and vision: (I) opening prayer (v. 1), followed by anticipated results if prayer is answered (vv. 2-7); (II) prayer (v. 8), followed by anticipated results if prayer is answered (vv. 9-14); (III) closing prayer (vv. 15-17). Whether a prayer, vision, or combination of the two, the psalm depicts the king's universal rule of peace and prosperity. As such it is indirectly messianic, for the ideal it expresses will only be fully realized during the Messiah's earthly reign. Verses 18-19 are a conclusion for Book 2 of the Psalter (Pss 42-72; cf. Ps 41:13, which contains a similar conclusion for Book 1), while v. 20 appears to be a remnant of an earlier collection of psalms or an earlier edition of the Psalter.<br>

The phrase "the king's son" in the second line may simply refer to "the king" of the first line, drawing attention to the fact that he has inherited his dynastic rule.

 <a name="fn2622" href="psa.htm#fnB2622"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (72:15)  The prefixed verbal form is jussive, not imperfect. Because the form has the prefixed <i>vav</i>, some subordinate it to what precedes as a purpose/result clause. In this case the representative poor individual might be the subject of this and the following verb, "so that he may live and give to him gold of Sheba." But the idea of the poor offering gold is incongruous. It is better to take the jussive as a prayer with the king as subject of the verb. (Perhaps the initial <i>vav</i> is dittographic; note the <i>vav</i> at the end of the last form in v. 14.) The statement is probably an abbreviated version of the formula <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ilmh yjy</FONT> ("may the king live"; see 1 Sam 10:24; 2 Sam 16:16; 1 Kgs 1:25, 34, 39; 2 Kgs 11:12).<br>

Perhaps the noun is related to the verbal root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hcp</FONT> ("to spread," see BDB 832; the root appears as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hsp</FONT> in post-biblical Hebrew), which is used in post-biblical Hebrew of the rising sun's rays spreading over the horizon and a tree's branches spreading out (see Jastrow, 1194). In Ps 72:16 a "spreading of grain" would refer to grain fields extending out over the land. C. A.

 <a name="fn2630" href="psa.htm#fnB2630"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (72:16)  The antecedent of the third masculine singular pronominal suffix in unclear.

See the note on the word "earth" at the end of the verse for a discussion of the poetic parallelism and interpretation of the verse. The present translation takes it with the preceding words, "like Lebanon its fruit" and emends the verb form from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wxyxyw</FONT> (Qal imperfect third masculine plural with prefixed <i>vav</i>) to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jyxy</FONT> (Qal imperfect third masculine singular). The initial <i>vav</i> is eliminated as dittographic (note the <i>vav</i> on the ending of the preceding form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wyrp</FONT> ["its/his fruit"]) and the <i>vav</i> at the end of the form is placed on the following emended form (see the note on the word "crops"), yielding <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rymuw</FONT> ("and [its] crops"). <br>

 <a name="fn2636" href="psa.htm#fnB2636"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tc</b> (72:16)  The traditional accentuation and vocalization of the MT differ from the text assumed by the present translation. The MT reads as follows: "May there be an abundance of grain in the earth, / and on the tops of the mountains! / May its [or, "his"?] fruit [trees?] rustle like [the trees of] Lebanon! / May they flourish from the city, like the grass of the earth!" If one follows the MT, then it would appear that the "fruit" of the third line is a metaphorical reference to the king's people, who flow out from the cities to populate the land (see line 4). Elsewhere in the OT people are sometimes compared to grass that sprouts up from the land (see v. 7, as well as Isa 27:6; Pss 92:7; 103:15). The translation understands a different poetic structural arrangement and, assuming the emendations mentioned in earlier notes, interprets each line of the verse to be a prayer for agricultural abundance.<br>
 <a name="fn2637" href="psa.htm#fnB2637"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (72:17)  <i>Heb</i> "may his name [be] permanent." The prefixed verbal form is jussive, not imperfect.<br>
 <a name="fn2638" href="psa.htm#fnB2638"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (72:17)  <i>Heb</i> "before the sun may his name increase." The Kethib (consonantal text) assumes <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/yn]y&#180;</FONT> (a Hiphil of the verbal root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/yn</FONT>) or <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/y}n~y+</FONT> (a Piel form), while the Qere (marginal reading) assumes <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/oNy]</FONT> (a Niphal form). The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/yn</FONT> occurs only here, though a derived noun, meaning "offspring," appears elsewhere (see Isa 14:22). The verb appears to mean "propagate, increase" (BDB 630) or "produce shoots, get descendants" (<i>HALOT</i> 696). In this context this appears to be a prayer for a lasting dynasty that will keep the king's name and memory alive.<br>
 <a name="fn2639" href="psa.htm#fnB2639"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (72:17)  <i>Heb</i> "may they bless one another by him," that is, use the king's name in their blessing formulae because he is a prime example of one blessed by God (for examples of such blessing formulae, see Gen 48:20 and Ruth 4:11).  There is some debate on whether the Hitpael form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">irb</FONT> ("bless") is reflexive-reciprocal (as assumed in the present translation) or passive. The Hitpael of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">irb</FONT> occurs in five other passages, including the hotly debated Gen 22:18 and 26:4. In these two texts one could understand the verb form as passive and translate, "all the nations of the earth <i>will be blessed</i> through your offspring," or one could take the Hitpael as reflexive or reciprocal and translate, "all the nations of the earth <i>will pronounce blessings</i> [i.e., on themselves or one another] by your offspring." In the first instance Abraham's (or Isaac's) offspring are viewed as a channel of divine blessing. In the second instance they are viewed as a prime example of blessing that will appear as part of the nations' blessing formulae, but not necessarily as a channel of blessing to the nations. In Deut 29:18 one reads: "When one hears the the words of this covenant [or, "oath"] and invokes a blessing on himself (Hitpael of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">irb</FONT>) in his heart, saying: `I will have peace, even though I walk with a rebellious heart.'" In this case the Hitpael is clearly reflexive, as the phrases "in his heart" and "I will have peace" indicate. The Hitpael of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">irb</FONT> appears twice in Isaiah 65:16: "The one who invokes a blessing on himself (see Deut 9:18) in the land will invoke that blessing by the God of truth; and the one who makes an oath in the land will make that oath by the God of truth." A passive nuance does not fit here. The parallel line, which mentions making an oath, suggests that the Hitpael of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">irb</FONT> refers here to invoking a blessing. Both pronouncements of blessing and oaths will appeal to God as the one who rewards and judges, respectively. Jer 4:2 states: "If you swear, `As surely as the LORD lives,' with truth, integrity, and honesty, then the nations will pronounce blessings by him and boast in him." A passive nuance might work ("the nations will be blessed"), but the context refers to verbal pronouncements (swearing an oath, boasting), suggesting that the Hitpael of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">irb</FONT> refers here to invoking a blessing. The logic of the verse seems to be as follows: If Israel conducts its affairs with integrity, the nation will be favored by the Lord, which will in turn attract the surrounding nations to Israel's God. To summarize, while the evidence might leave the door open for a passive interpretation, there is no clear cut passive use. Usage favors a reflexive or reciprocal understanding of the Hitpael of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">irb</FONT>. In Ps 72:17 the Hitpael of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">irb</FONT> is followed by the prepositional phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wb</FONT> ("by him"). The verb could theoretically be taken as passive, "may all the nations <i>be blessed</i> through him" (cf. NIV, NRSV), because the preceding context describes the positive effects of this king's rule on the inhabitants of the earth. But the parallel line, which employs the Piel of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> in a factitive/declarative sense, "regard as happy, fortunate," suggests a reflexive or reciprocal nuance for the Hitpael of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">irb</FONT> here. If the nations regard the ideal king as a prime example of one who is fortunate or blessed, it is understandable that they would use his name in their pronouncements of blessing.<br>

As noted earlier, v. 20 appears to be a remnant of an earlier collection of psalms or an earlier edition of the Psalter. In the present arrangement of the Book of Psalms, not all psalms prior to this are attributed to David (see Pss 1-2, 10, 33, 42-50, 66-67, 71-72) and several psalms attributed to David appear after this (see Pss 86, 101, 103, 108-110, 122, 124, 131, 138-145).<br>
 <a name="fn2647" href="psa.htm#fnB2647"><sup>57</sup></a><b>sn</b> (72:20)  <i>Psalm 73</i>. In this wisdom psalm the psalmist offers a personal testimony of his struggle with the age-old problem of the prosperity of the wicked. As he observed evil men prosper, he wondered if a godly lifestyle really pays off. In the midst of his discouragement, he reflected upon spiritual truths and realities. He was reminded that the prosperity of the wicked is only temporary. God will eventually vindicate his people.<br>
 <a name="fn2648" href="psa.htm#fnB2648"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (73:1)  Since the psalm appears to focus on an individual's concerns, not the situation of Israel, this introduction may be a later addition designed to apply the psalm's message to the entire community.

 <b>sn</b> (73:2)  <i>My feet almost slid out from under me</i>. The language is metaphorical. As the following context makes clear, the psalmist almost "slipped" in a spiritual sense. As he began to question God's justice, the psalmist came close to abandoning his faith.<br>

Since a reference to the death of the wicked seems incongruous in the immediate context (note v. 5) and premature in the argument of the psalm (see vv. 18-20, 27), some prefer to emend the text by redividing it. The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;twml</FONT> ("at their death") is changed to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;T* oml*</FONT> ("[there are no pains] to them, strong [and fat are their bodies]"). The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;t</FONT> ("complete; sound") is used of physical beauty in Song 5:2; 6:9. This emendation is the basis for the present translation. However, in defense of the MT (the traditional Hebrew text), one may point to an Aramaic inscription from Nerab which views a painful death as a curse and a non-painful death in one's old age as a sign of divine favor. See J. B. Pritchard, <i>ANET</i>, 661.<br>

 <a name="fn2659" href="psa.htm#fnB2659"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tc</b> (73:7)  The MT reads "it goes out from fatness their eye," which might be paraphrased, "their eye protrudes [or, "bulges"] because of fatness." This in turn might refer to their greed; their eyes "bug out" when they see rich food or produce (the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">blj</FONT> ["fatness"] sometimes refers to such food or produce, see BDB 316-17). However, when used with the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">axy</FONT> ("go out") the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m</FONT> ("from") more naturally indicates source. For this reason it is preferable to emend <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wmnyu</FONT> ("their eye") to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">omn&#180;ou&amp;</FONT> ("their sin") and read, "and their sin proceeds forth from fatness," that is, their prosperity gives rise to their sinful attitudes. If one follows this textual reading, another interpretive option is to take <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">blj</FONT> ("fatness") in the sense of "unreceptive, insensitive" (see its use in Ps 17:10). In this case, the sin of the wicked proceeds forth from their spiritual insensitivity.<br>
 <a name="fn2660" href="psa.htm#fnB2660"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (73:7)  <i>Heb</i> "the thoughts of [their] heart [i.e., mind] cross over" (i.e. violate God's moral boundary, see Ps 17:3).<br>

The traditional accentuation of the MT places "oppression" with the preceding line. In this case, one might translate, "they mock and speak with evil [of] oppression, from an elevated place [i.e., "proudly"] they speak." By placing "oppression" with what follows, one achieves better poetic balance in the parallelism.<br>
 <a name="fn2664" href="psa.htm#fnB2664"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (73:9)  <i>Heb</i> "they set in heaven their mouth, and their tongue walks through the earth." The meaning of the text is uncertain. Perhaps the idea is that they lay claim to heaven (i.e., speak as if they were ruling in heaven) and move through the earth declaring their superiority and exerting their influence. Some take the preposition -<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">b</FONT> the first line as adversative and translate, "they set their mouth against heaven," that is, they defy God.<br>
 <a name="fn2665" href="psa.htm#fnB2665"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tc</b> (73:10)  <i>Heb</i> "therefore his people return [so Qere (marginal reading); Kethib (consonantal text) has "he brings back"] to here, and waters of abundance are sucked up by them." The traditional Hebrew text (MT) defies explanation. The present translation reflects Dahood's proposed emendations (see M. Dahood, <i>Psalms</i>, 2:190) and reads the Hebrew text as follows: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">oml* WXm)y&#180; al@m* ym@W &lt;j#l# &lt;Wub=c=y] /k@l*</FONT> ("therefore they are filled with food, and waters of abundance they suck up for themselves"). The reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;j#l# &lt;Wub=c=y]</FONT> ("they are filled with food") assumes (1) an emendation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wmu byvy</FONT> ("he will bring back his people") to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;Wub=c=y]</FONT> ("they will be filled"; a Qal imperfect third masculine plural form from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ubc</FONT>, with enclitic <i>mem</i>), and (2) an emendation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;lh</FONT> ("to here") to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;j#l#</FONT> ("food"). The expression "be filled/fill with food" appears elsewhere at least ten times (see Ps 132:15, for example). In the second line the Niphal form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WxM*y]</FONT> (derived from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hxm</FONT> ["drain"]) is emended to a Qal form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WXm)y&#180;</FONT>, derived from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jxm</FONT> ("to suck"). In Isa 66:11 the verbs <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ubc</FONT> (proposed in Ps 73:10a) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jxm</FONT> (proposed in Ps 73:10b) are parallel. The point of the emended text is this: Because they are seemingly sovereign (v. 9), they become greedy and grab up everything they need and more.<br>

In Deut 14:1 the Israelites are referred to as God's "sons." Perhaps the psalmist refers here to those who are "Israelites" in the true sense because of their loyalty to God (note the juxtaposition of "Israel" with "the pure in heart" in v. 1).<br>

Some interpreters view this as the psalmist's confidence in an afterlife in God's presence and understand <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dwbk</FONT> as a metonymic reference to God's presence in heaven. But this seems unlikely in the present context. The psalmist anticipates a time of vindication, when the wicked are destroyed and he is honored by God for his godly life style. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jql</FONT> ("take") here carries the nuance "lead, guide, conduct," as in Num 23:14, 27-28; Josh 24:3 and Prov 24:11.<br>

Briggs, <i>Psalms</i>, 2:159, emends <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">djy</FONT> ("altogether") to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dyjy</FONT> ("alone") and translates, "let their offspring be solitary" (i.e., exiled). Another option is to understand the form as a Qal imperfect first common plural from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hny</FONT> ("to oppress") with a third masculine plural pronominal suffix, "we will oppress them." However, this verb, when used in the finite form, always appears in the Hiphil. Therefore, it is preferable to emend the form to the Hiphil <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;n}on</FONT> ("we will oppress them"; see <i>HALOT</i> 416).<br>

Because of the reference to a prophet in the next line, it is likely that the "signs" in view here include the evidence of God's presence as typically revealed through the prophets. These could include miraculous acts performed by the prophets (see, for example, Isa 38:7-8) or object lessons which they acted out (see, for example, Isa 20:3).<br>

The psalmist pictures God as having placed his right hand (symbolic of activity and strength) inside his robe against his chest. He prays that God would pull his hand out from under his robe and use it to destroy the enemy.<br>
 <a name="fn2726" href="psa.htm#fnB2726"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (74:12)  The psalmist speaks as Israel's representative here.<br>

 <a name="fn2729" href="psa.htm#fnB2729"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (74:13)  The Hebrew text has the plural form, "sea monsters" (cf. NRSV "dragons"), but it is likely that an original enclitic <i>mem</i> has been misunderstood as a plural ending. The imagery of the mythological sea monster is utilized here. See the note on "Leviathan" in v. 14.<br>
 <a name="fn2730" href="psa.htm#fnB2730"><sup>29</sup></a><b>sn</b> (74:14)  <i>You crushed the heads of Leviathan</i>. The imagery of vv. 13-14 originates in West Semitic mythology. The description of Leviathan should be compared with the following excerpts from Ugaritic mythological texts: (1) "Was not the dragon [Ugaritic <i>tnn</i>, cognate with Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ynt</FONT>, translated "sea monster" in v. 13] vanquished and captured? I did destroy the wriggling [Ugaritic <i>&#180;qltn</i>, cognate to Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/wtlqu</FONT>, translated "squirming" in Isa 27:1] serpent, the tyrant with seven heads" (note the use of the plural "heads" here and in v. 13). (See <i>CTA</i> 3.iii.38-39 in J. C. L. Gibson, <i>Canaanite Myths and Legends</i>, 50.) (2) "For all that you smote Leviathan the slippery [Ugaritic<i> brh</i>, cognate to Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jrb</FONT>, translated "fast moving" in Isa 27:1] serpent, [and] made an end of the wriggling serpent, the tyrant with seven heads" (See <i>CTA</i> 5.i.1-3 in J. C. L. Gibson, <i>Canaanite Myths and Legends</i>, 68.) In the myths Leviathan is a sea creature that symbolizes the destructive water of the sea and, in turn, the forces of chaos that threaten the established order. In the OT, the battle with the sea motif is applied to Yahweh's victories over the forces of chaos at creation and in history (see Pss 74:13-14; 77:16-20; 89:9-10; Isa 51:9-10). Yahweh's subjugation of the waters of chaos is related to his kingship (see Pss 29:3, 10; 93:3-4). Isa 27:1 applies imagery from Canaanite mythology to Yahweh's eschatological victory over his enemies. Apocalyptic literature employs the imagery as well. The beasts of Dan 7 emerge from the sea, while Rev 13 speaks of a seven-headed beast coming from the sea. Here in Ps 74:13-14 the primary referent is unclear. The psalmist may be describing God's creation of the world (note vv. 16-17 and see Ps 89:9-12), when he brought order out of a watery mass, or the exodus (see Isa 51:9-10), when he created Israel by destroying the Egyptians in the waters of the sea.<br>

This pictures the fragments of Leviathan's dead corpse washing up on shore and being devoured by those who find them. If the exodus is in view, then it may allude to the bodies of the dead Egyptians which washed up on the shore of the Red Sea (see Exod 14:30).<br>
 <a name="fn2733" href="psa.htm#fnB2733"><sup>32</sup></a><b>sn</b> (74:15)  <i>You broke open the spring and the stream</i>. Perhaps this alludes to the way in which God provided water for the Israelites as they traveled in the wilderness following the exodus (see Ps 78:15-16, 20; 105:41).<br>

 <a name="fn2745" href="psa.htm#fnB2745"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (74:20)  <i>Heb</i> "for the dark places of the earth are full of dwelling places of violence." The "dark regions" are probably the lands where the people have been exiled (see C. A. Briggs, <i>Psalms</i>, 2:157). In some contexts "dark regions" refers to Sheol (Ps 88:6) or to hiding places likened to Sheol (Ps 143:3; Lam 3:6).<br>

The presence of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk</FONT> ("for") at the beginning of both vv. 6-7 seems to indicate that vv. 4-9 are a unit. However, there is no formal indication of a new speaker in v. 4 (or in v. 10, where God appears to speak). Another option is to see God speaking in vv. 2-6 and v. 10 and to take only vv. 7-9 as the words of the psalmist. In this case one must interpret <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk</FONT> at the beginning of v. 7 in an asseverative or emphatic sense ("surely; indeed").<br>

The horn of the wild ox is frequently a metaphor for military strength; the idiom "exalt/lift up the horn" signifies military victory (see 1 Sam 2:10; Pss 89:17, 24; 92:10; Lam 2:17).

This could mean that men's anger (subjective genitive), when punished by God, will bring him praise, but this interpretation does not harmonize well with the next line. The translation assumes that God's anger is in view here (see v. 7) and that "men" is an objective genitive.

Having opened with an affirmation of confidence, he then retraces how he gained confidence during his trial (see vv. 2-12).<br>
 <a name="fn2800" href="psa.htm#fnB2800"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (77:2)  Here the psalmist refers back to the very recent past, when he began to pray for divine help.<br>
 <a name="fn2801" href="psa.htm#fnB2801"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (77:2)  <i>Heb</i> "my hand [at] night was extended and was not growing numb." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rgn</FONT>, which can mean "flow" in certain contexts, here has the nuance "be extended" (see <i>HALOT</i> 669-70). The imperfect form (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gwpt</FONT>, "to be numb") is used here to describe continuous action in the past.<br>
 <a name="fn2802" href="psa.htm#fnB2802"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (77:2)  Or "my soul." The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vpn</FONT> with a pronominal suffix is often equivalent to a pronoun, especially in poetry (see BDB 660 [4]).<br>
 <a name="fn2803" href="psa.htm#fnB2803"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (77:3)  <i>Heb</i> "I will remember God and I will groan, I will reflect and my spirit will grow faint." The first three verbs are cohortatives, the last a perfect with <i>vav</i> consecutive. The psalmist's statement in v. 4 could be understood as concurrent with v. 1, or, more likely, as a quotation of what he had said earlier as he prayed to God (see v. 2). The words "I said" are supplied in the translation at the beginning of the verse to reflect this interpretation (see v. 10).<br>
 <a name="fn2804" href="psa.htm#fnB2804"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (77:4)  <i>Heb</i> "you held fast the guards of my eyes." The "guards of the eyes" apparently refers to his eyelids. The psalmist seems to be saying that God would not bring him relief, which would have allowed him to shut his eyes and get some sleep (see v. 2).<br>
 <a name="fn2805" href="psa.htm#fnB2805"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (77:4)  The imperfect is used in the second clause to emphasize that this was an ongoing condition in the past.<br>
 <a name="fn2806" href="psa.htm#fnB2806"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (77:5)  <i>Heb</i> "the years of antiquity."<br>
 <a name="fn2807" href="psa.htm#fnB2807"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (77:6)  <i>Heb</i> "I will remember my song in the night, with my heart I will reflect. And my spirit searched." As in v. 4, the words of v. 6a are understood as what the psalmist said earlier. Consequently the words "I said" are supplied in the translation for clarification (see v. 10). The prefixed verbal form with <i>vav</i> consecutive at the beginning of the final line is taken as sequential to the perfect "I thought" in v. 6.<br>
 <a name="fn2808" href="psa.htm#fnB2808"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (77:7)  As in vv. 4 and 6a, the words of vv. 7-9 are understood as a quotation of what the psalmist said earlier. Therefore the words "I asked" are supplied in the translation for clarification.<br>
 <a name="fn2809" href="psa.htm#fnB2809"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (77:8)  <i>Heb</i> "word," which may refer here to God's word of promise (note the reference to "loyal love" in the preceding line).<br>

This divine title (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/oyl=u#</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u#l=yo/</FONT>) pictures God as the exalted ruler of the universe who vindicates the innocent and judges the wicked. See especially Pss 7:17; 9:2; 18:13; 21:7; 47:2.<br>
 <a name="fn2811" href="psa.htm#fnB2811"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tc</b> (77:10)  <i>Heb</i> "And I said, `This is my wounding, the changing of the right hand of the Most High.'" The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yt!oLj^</FONT> appears to be a Qal infinitive construct (with a first person singular pronominal suffix) from the verbal root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">llj</FONT> ("to pierce; to wound"; see BDB 319). The present translation assumes an emendation to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yt!olj&amp;</FONT>, a Qal infinitive construct (with a first person singular pronominal suffix) from the verbal root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlj</FONT> ("be sick, weak"; see BDB 317). The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">t.nv</FONT> is understood as a Qal infinitive construct from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnv</FONT> ("to change") rather than a plural noun form, "years" (see v. 5). "Right hand" here symbolizes by metonymy God's power and activity. The psalmist observes that his real problem is theological in nature. His experience suggests that the sovereign Lord has abandoned him and become inactive. However, this goes against the grain of his most cherished beliefs.<br>
 <a name="fn2812" href="psa.htm#fnB2812"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (77:11)  <i>Heb</i> "yes, I will remember from old your wonders."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (77:11)  The psalmist refuses to allow skepticism to win out. God has revealed himself to his people in tangible, incontrovertible ways in the past and the psalmist vows to <i>remember</i> the historical record as a source of hope for the future.<br>
 <a name="fn2813" href="psa.htm#fnB2813"><sup>16</sup></a><b>sn</b> (77:13)  Verses 13-20 are the content of the psalmist's reflection (see vv. 11-12). As he thought about God's work in Israel's past, he reached the place where he could confidently cry out for God's help (see v. 1).<br>
 <a name="fn2814" href="psa.htm#fnB2814"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (77:13)  <i>Heb</i> "O God, in holiness [is] your way." God's "way" here refers to his actions. "Holiness" is used here in the sense of "set apart, unique," rather than in a moral/ethical sense. As the next line and the next verse emphasize, God's deeds are incomparable and set him apart as the one true God.<br>
 <a name="fn2815" href="psa.htm#fnB2815"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (77:13)  <i>Heb</i> "Who [is] a great god like God?" The rhetorical question assumes the answer, "No one!"<br>

 <b>sn</b> (77:18)  Verses 16-18 depict the LORD coming in the storm to battle his enemies and subdue the sea. There is no record of such a storm in the historical account of the Red Sea crossing. The language the psalmist uses here is stereotypical and originates in Canaanite myth, where the storm god Baal subdues the sea in his quest for kingship. The psalmist has employed the stereotypical imagery to portray the exodus vividly and at the same time affirm that it is not Baal who subdues the sea, but Yahweh.<br>

He praises God for his power, goodness and patience, but also reminds his audience that sin angers God and prompts his judgment. In the conclusion to the psalm the author elevates Jerusalem as God's chosen city and David as his chosen king.<br>
 <a name="fn2830" href="psa.htm#fnB2830"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (77:20)  The meaning of the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lykcm</FONT> ("<i>maskil</i>") is uncertain. See the note on the phrase "well-written song" in the superscription of Ps 74.<br>

Elsewhere the Hebrew word pair <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hdyj</FONT> + <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lvm</FONT> refers to a taunt song (Hab 2:6), a parable (Ezek 17:2), proverbial sayings (Prov 1:6), and an insightful song that reflects on the mortality of humankind and the ultimate inability of riches to prevent death Ps 49:4).<br>

 <a name="fn2859" href="psa.htm#fnB2859"><sup>29</sup></a><b>sn</b> (78:25)  Because of the reference to "heaven" in the preceding verse, it is likely that <i>mighty ones</i> refers here to the angels of heaven.

 <b>sn</b> (78:41)  The basic sense of the word "holy" is "set apart from that which is commonplace, special, unique." The Lord's holiness is first and foremost his transcendent sovereignty as the ruler of the world. He is "set apart" from the world over which he rules. At the same time his holiness encompasses his moral authority, which derives from his royal position. As king he has the right to dictate to his subjects how they are to live; indeed his very own character sets the standard for proper behavior. See the notes on Isa 6:3.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (81:3)  <i>New moon</i> festivals were a monthly ritual in Israel (see R. de Vaux, <i>Institutes of Ancient Israel</i>, 2:469-70). In this context the New Moon festival of the seventh month, when the Feast of Tabernacles was celebrated (note the reference to a "festival" in the next line), may be in view.<br>
 <a name="fn2990" href="psa.htm#fnB2990"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (81:3)  <i>Heb</i> "at the full moon on the day of our festival."

 <b>sn</b> (81:3)  The <i>festival </i>in view is probably the Feast of Tabernacles (Booths), which began on the fifteenth day of the seventh month when the moon was full. See Lev 23:34; Num 29:12.<br>

This apparently refers to the general time period of Israel's exodus from Egypt. The LXX reads, "from Egypt," in which case "Joseph" (see the preceding line) would be the subject of the verb, "when he [Joseph = Israel] left Egypt."<br>
 <a name="fn2993" href="psa.htm#fnB2993"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (81:5)  <i>Heb</i> "a lip I did not know, I heard." Here the term "lip" probably stands for speech or a voice. Apparently the psalmist speaks here and refers to God's voice, whose speech is recorded in the following verses.<br>

The reference to a basket/burden probably alludes to the hard labor of the Israelites in Egypt, where they had to carry loads of bricks (see Exod 1:14).<br>
 <a name="fn2996" href="psa.htm#fnB2996"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (81:7)  <i>Heb</i> "I answered you in the hidden place of thunder." This may allude to God's self-revelation at Mount Sinai, where he appeared in a dark cloud accompanied by thunder (see Exod 19:16).<br>

In Ps 18:44 the verb seems to carry the nuance "to be weak; to be powerless" (see also Ps 109:24). The prefixed verbal form is taken as a jussive, parallel to the jussive form in the next line.<br>
 <a name="fn3012" href="psa.htm#fnB3012"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tc</b> (81:15)  <i>Heb</i> "and may their time be forever." The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;tu</FONT> ("their time") must refer here to the "time" of the demise and humiliation of those who hate the LORD. Some propose an emendation to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ttub</FONT> or <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;tub</FONT> ("their terror"; i.e., "may their terror last forever"), but the omission of <i>bet</i> in the present Hebrew text is difficult to explain, making the proposed emendation unlikely.<br>
 <b>tn</b> (81:15)  The verb form at the beginning of the line is jussive, indicating that this is a prayer. The translation assumes that v. 15 is a parenthetical "curse" offered by the psalmist. Having heard the reference to Israel's enemies (v. 14), the psalmist inserts this prayer, reminding the Lord that they are God's enemies as well.<br>
 <a name="fn3013" href="psa.htm#fnB3013"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (81:16)  <i>Heb</i> "and he fed him from the best of the wheat." The Hebrew text has a third person form of the preterite with a <i>vav</i> consecutive attached. However, it is preferable, in light of the use of the first person in v. 14 and in the next line, to emend the verb to a first person form and understand the <i>vav</i> as conjunctive, continuing the apodosis of the conditional sentence of vv. 13-14. The third masculine singular pronominal suffix refers to Israel, as in v. 6.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (81:16)  <i>I would feed</i>. After the parenthetical "curse" in v. 15, the Lord's speech continues here.<br>

 <a name="fn3016" href="psa.htm#fnB3016"><sup>29</sup></a><b>sn</b> (81:16)  <i>Psalm 82</i>. The psalmist pictures God standing in the "assembly of El" where he accuses the "gods" of failing to promote justice on earth. God pronounces sentence upon them, announcing that they will die like men. Having witnessed the scene, the psalmist then asks God to establish his just rule over the earth.<br>
 <a name="fn3017" href="psa.htm#fnB3017"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (82:1)  Or "presides over."<br>
 <a name="fn3018" href="psa.htm#fnB3018"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (82:1)  The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la tdu</FONT>, "assembly of El," appears only here in the OT. (1) Some understand "El" to refer to God himself. In this case he is pictured presiding over his own heavenly assembly. (2) Others take <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la</FONT> as a superlative here ("God stands in the <i>great</i> assembly"), as in Pss 36:6 and 80:10. (3) The present translation assumes this is a reference to the Canaanite high god El, who presided over the Canaanite divine assembly. (See Isa 14:13, where El's assembly is called "the stars of El.") In the Ugaritic myths the phrase <i>&#180;dt </i>`<i>ilm</i> refers to the "assembly of the gods," who congregate in King Kirtu's house, where Baal asks El to bless Kirtu's house (see J. C. L. Gibson, <i>Canaanite Myths and Legends</i>, 91). If the Canaanite divine assembly is referred to here in Ps 82:1, then the psalm must be understood as a bold polemic against Canaanite religion. Israel's God invades El's assembly, denounces its gods as failing to uphold justice, and announces their coming demise. For an interpretation of the psalm along these lines, see W. VanGemeren, "Psalms," in <i>EBC</i> 5:533-36.<br>
 <a name="fn3019" href="psa.htm#fnB3019"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (82:1)  The present translation assumes that the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yhla</FONT> ("gods") here refers to the pagan gods who supposedly comprise El's assembly according to Canaanite religion. Those who reject the polemical view of the psalm prefer to see the referent as human judges or rulers (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yhla</FONT> sometimes refers to officials appointed by God, see Exod 21:6; 22:8-9; Ps 45:6) or as angelic beings (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yhla</FONT> sometimes refers to angelic beings, see Gen 3:5; Ps 8:5).<br>
 <a name="fn3020" href="psa.htm#fnB3020"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (82:1)  The picture of God rendering <i>judgment</i> among the gods clearly depicts his sovereign authority as universal king (see v. 8, where the psalmist boldly affirms this truth).<br>

 <a name="fn3032" href="psa.htm#fnB3032"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (82:8)  The translation assumes that the Qal of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ljn</FONT> here means "to own; to possess," and that the imperfect emphasizes a general truth.

Because Sisera and Jabin are mentioned in v. 9b, many understand them to be the subject of the verbs in v. 10, though relate v. 10 to Gideon's victory, which is referred to in v. 9a, 11.

If taken in the latter sense here, one could understand the term as a metonymical reference to dust blown by a whirlwind (cf. NRSV "like whirling dust"). However, <i>HALOT</i> 190 understands the noun as a homonym referring to a "dead thistle" here and in Isa 17:13.

The Hebrew expression <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">du-ydu</FONT> ("to perpetuity") can mean "forevermore" (see Pss 92:7; 132:12, 14), but here it may be used hyperbolically, for the psalmist asks that the experience of judgment might lead the nations to recognize (v. 18) and even to seek (v. 16) God.<br>
 <a name="fn3063" href="psa.htm#fnB3063"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (83:17)  <i>Heb</i> "may they be ashamed and perish." The four prefixed verbal forms in this verse are understood as jussives. The psalmist concludes his prayer with an imprecation, calling severe judgment down on his enemies. The strong language of the imprecation seems to run contrary to the positive outcome of divine judgment envisioned in v. 16b. Perhaps the language of v. 17 is overstated for effect. Another option is that v. 16b expresses an ideal, while the strong imprecation of vv. 17-18 anticipates reality. It would be nice if the defeated nations actually pursued a relationship with God, but if judgment does not bring them to that point, the psalmist asks that they be annihilated so that they might at least be forced to acknowledge God's power.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (84:3)  The psalmist here romanticizes the temple as a place of refuge and safety. As he thinks of the <i>birds</i> nesting near its roof, he envisions them finding protection in God's presence.<br>
 <a name="fn3076" href="psa.htm#fnB3076"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (84:4)  The Hebrew noun translated "happy" is an abstract plural. The word often refers metonymically to the happiness that God-given security and prosperity produce (see v. 12 and Pss 1:1; 2:12; 34:9; 41:1; 65:4; 89:15; 106:3; 112:1; 127:5; 128:1; 144:15).<br>

Hebrew literature often assumes and reflects the male-oriented perspective of ancient Israelite society. The principle stated here was certainly applicable to all people, regardless of their gender or age. To facilitate modern application, we translate the gender and age specific "man" with the plural "those." The individual referred to in v. 5a is representative of followers of God, as the use of plural forms in vv. 5b-7 indicates.<br>

 <a name="fn3079" href="psa.htm#fnB3079"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (84:6)  The translation assumes that the Hebrew phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">akbh qmu</FONT> is the name of an otherwise unknown arid valley through which pilgrims to Jerusalem passed. The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">akb</FONT> may be the name of a particular type of plant or shrub that grew in this valley (see <i>HALOT</i> 129). O. Borowski (<i>Agriculture in Iron Age Israel</i>, 130) suggests it is the black mulberry. Some take the phrase as purely metaphorical and relate <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">akb</FONT> to the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkb</FONT> ("to weep"). In this case one might translate, "the valley of weeping" or "the valley of affliction."<br>
 <a name="fn3080" href="psa.htm#fnB3080"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tc</b> (84:6)  The MT reads "a spring they make it," but this makes little sense.

 <b>sn</b> (84:6)  <i>Pools of water</i>. Because water is so necessary for life, it makes an apt symbol for divine favor and blessing. As the pilgrims traveled to Jerusalem, God provided for their physical needs and gave them a token of his favor and of the blessings awaiting them at the temple.<br>
 <a name="fn3083" href="psa.htm#fnB3083"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (84:7)  <i>Heb</i> "they go from strength to strength." The phrase "from strength to strength" occurs only here in the OT. With a verb of motion, the expression "from [common noun] to [same common noun]" normally suggests movement from one point to another or through successive points (see Num 36:7; 1 Chr 16:20; 17:5; Ps 105:13; Jer 25:32). Ps 84:7 may be emphasizing that the pilgrims move successively from one "place of strength" to another as they travel toward Jerusalem. All along the way they find adequate provisions and renewed energy for the trip.<br>

 <a name="fn3086" href="psa.htm#fnB3086"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (84:9)  The phrase "our shield" refers metaphorically to the Davidic king, who, as God's vice-regent, was the human protector of the people. Note the parallelism with "your anointed one" here and with "our king" in Ps 89:18.<br>
 <a name="fn3087" href="psa.htm#fnB3087"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (84:9)  <i>Heb</i> "look [on] the face of your anointed one."

The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[ps</FONT> appears only here in the OT; it is derived from the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[s</FONT> ("threshold"). Traditionally some have interpreted this as a reference to being a doorkeeper at the temple, though some understand it to mean "lie as a beggar at the entrance to the temple" (see <i>HALOT</i> 765).<br>

It appears twice in the Qal, meaning "be joined" in both cases (Gen 49:6; Isa 14:20).

 <a name="fn3140" href="psa.htm#fnB3140"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (86:16)  <i>Heb</i> "the son of your female servant." The phrase "son of a female servant" (see also Ps 116:16) is used of a son born to a secondary wife or concubine (Exod 23:12). In some cases the child's father is the master of the house (see Gen 21:10, 13; Judg 9:18). The use of the expression here certainly does not imply that the LORD has such a secondary wife or concubine! It is used metaphorically and idiomatically to emphasize the psalmist's humility before the LORD and his status as the LORD's servant.<br>

 <a name="fn3144" href="psa.htm#fnB3144"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (86:17)  <i>Psalm 87</i>. The psalmist celebrates the Lord's presence in Zion and the special status of its citizens.<br>

 <a name="fn3146" href="psa.htm#fnB3146"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (87:3)  <i>Heb</i> "glorious things are spoken about you." The translation assumes this is a general reference to compliments paid to Zion by those who live within her walls and by those who live in the surrounding areas and lands.

The verbal construction (the Hiphil of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rkz</FONT> ["remember"] followed by the preposition -<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l</FONT> with a substantive) is rare, but the prepositional phrase is best understood as indicating the recipient of the announcement (see Jer 4:16). Some take the preposition in the sense of "among" and translate, "among those who know me" (cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV). In this case these foreigners are viewed as the LORD's people and the psalm is interpreted as anticipating a time when all nations will worship the LORD (see Ps 86:9) and be considered citizens of Zion.<br>

The words "It is said of them" not in the Hebrew text, but are supplied for clarification and stylistic purposes (see v. 5). Those advocating the universalistic interpretation understand "there" as referring to Zion, but it seems more likely that the adverb refers to the nations just mentioned. The foreigners are identified by their native lands.<br>
 <a name="fn3152" href="psa.htm#fnB3152"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (87:5)  <i>Heb</i> "and of Zion it is said." Another option is to translate, "and to Zion it is said." In collocation with the Niphal of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rma</FONT>, the preposition <i>lamed</i> (-<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l</FONT>) can introduce the recipient of the statement (see Josh 2:2; Jer 4:11; Hos 1:10; Zeph 3:16), carry the nuance "concerning, of" (see Num 23:23), or mean "be named" (see Isa 4:3; 62:4).<br>
 <a name="fn3153" href="psa.htm#fnB3153"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (87:5)  <i>Heb</i> "a man and a man." The idiom also appears in Esth 1:8. The translation assumes that the phrase refers to each of Zion's residents, in contrast to the foreigners mentioned in v. 4 .

Though <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yla</FONT> is vocalized as a plural form ("gods") in the Hebrew text, it is likely that the final <i>mem</i> is actually enclitic rather than a plural marker. In this case one may read "God." Some, following a Qumran text and the LXX, also propose the phrase occurred in the original text of Deut 32:8. The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yla ynb</FONT> ("sons of gods" or "sons of God") occurs only here and in Ps 29:1. Since the "sons of gods/God" are here associated with "the assembly of the holy ones" and "council of the holy ones," the heavenly assembly (comprised of so-called "angels" and other supernatural beings) appears to be in view. See Job 5:1; 15:15 and Zech 14:5, where these supernatural beings are referred to as "holy ones." In Canaanite mythological texts the divine council of the high god El is called "the sons of El."

Since it is sometimes used of Egypt (see Ps 87:4; Isa 30:7), the passage may allude to the exodus. However, the name is also used of the sea (or the mythological sea creature) which symbolizes the disruptive forces of the world that seek to replace order with chaos (see Job 9:13; 26:12). Isa 51:9 appears to combine the mythological and historical referents. The association of Rahab with the sea in Ps 89 (see v. 9) suggests that the name carries symbolic force in this context. In this case the passage may allude to creation (see vv. 11-12), when God overcame the great deep and brought order out of chaos.<br>

The horn of an ox underlies the metaphor (see Deut 33:17; 1 Kgs 22:11; Ps 92:10). The horn of the wild ox is frequently a metaphor for military strength; the idiom "exalt/lift up the horn" signifies military victory (see 1 Sam 2:10; Pss 75:10; 89:24; 92:10; Lam 2:17).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (89:18)  <i>Sovereign Ruler</i>. The basic sense of the word "holy" is "set apart from that which is commonplace, special, unique." The Lord's holiness is first and foremost his transcendent sovereignty as the ruler of the world. He is "set apart" from the world over which he rules. At the same time his holiness encompasses his moral authority, which derives from his royal position. As king he has the right to dictate to his subjects how they are to live; indeed his very own character sets the standard for proper behavior. See the notes on Isa 6:3.<br>

This may allude to the practice of a conqueror forcing his subjects to pay tribute in exchange for "protection." Another option is to take the verb from a homonymic verbal root meaning "to deceive," "to trick."

The horn of the wild ox is frequently a metaphor for military strength; the idiom "exalt/lift up the horn" signifies military victory (see 1 Sam 2:10; Pss 75:10; 92:10; Lam 2:17).<br>

The idiom reflects ancient Near Eastern adoption language associated with covenants of grant, by which a lord would reward a faithful subject by elevating him to special status, referred to as "sonship." Like a son, the faithful subject received an "inheritance," viewed as an unconditional, eternal gift. Such gifts usually took the form of land and/or an enduring dynasty. See M.

In this case one may translate the second line, "[it] will be secure like the skies." Another option (the one reflected in the present translation) is to take <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">du</FONT> as a rare noun meaning "throne" or "dais."

Emending <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qjvb</FONT> ("in the heavens") to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qjvk</FONT> ("like the heavens")--<i>bet/kaf</i> confusion is widely attested--one can then read, "[his] throne like the heavens [is] firm/stable."

The Polel verbal form in the Hebrew text pictures God giving birth to the world. The LXX and some other ancient textual witnesses assume a <i>polal</i> (passive) verbal form here.

 <a name="fn3283" href="psa.htm#fnB3283"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (90:2)  <i>Heb</i> "and from everlasting to everlasting you [are] God."

In this case v. 3a reads as a prayer, "do not turn man back to a low place."

 <a name="fn3285" href="psa.htm#fnB3285"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (90:3)  The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">akd</FONT> carries the basic sense of "crushed." Elsewhere it refers to those who are "crushed" in spirit or contrite of heart (see Ps 34:18; Isa 57:15). If one understands this nuance here, then v. 3 is observing that God leads mankind to repentance (the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwv</FONT> ["return"], which appears twice in this verse, is sometimes used of repentance.) However, the following context laments mankind's mortality and the brevity of life, so it is doubtful if v. 3 should be understood so positively. It is more likely that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">akd</FONT> here refers to "crushed matter," that is, the dust that fills the grave (see <i>HALOT</i> 221; BDB 194).

However, the verb form here is Qal, not Polel, and is better understood as a homonym meaning "to make an end [of life]" (see <i>HALOT</i> 281). The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnv</FONT> ("sleep") can be taken as an adverbial accusative; it is a euphemism here for death (see Ps 76:5-6).<br>

In Ezek 2:10 the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hgh</FONT> elsewhere refers to a grumbling or moaning sound. Here a brief sigh or moan is probably in view (see BDB 212). If so, the simile pictures one's lifetime as transient. Another option is that the simile alludes to the weakness that characteristically overtakes a person at the end of one's lifetime. In this case the phrase could be translated, "we end our lives with a painful moan."<br>

Here the "pride" of one's days (see v. 9) probably refers to one's most productive years in the prime of life. The words translated "destruction and wickedness" are also paired in Ps 10:7. They also appear in proximity in Pss 7:14 and 55:10. The oppressive and abusive actions of evil men are probably in view (see Job 4:8; 5:6; 15:35; Isa 10:1; 59:4).<br>

However, here the context seems to demand "feel sorrow for," "have pity on." In Deut 32:36 and Ps 135:14, where "servants" is also the object of the preposition, this idea is expressed with the Hitpael form of the verb.<br>

 <a name="fn3320" href="psa.htm#fnB3320"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (91:1)  The divine name used here is "Shaddai" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yD~v^</FONT>; see also Ps 68:14). Shaddai (or El Shaddai) is the mighty king (sovereign judge) of the world who grants life/blesses and kills/judges.

 <a name="fn3325" href="psa.htm#fnB3325"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (91:5)  This probably alludes to a sneak attack by enemies in the darkness of night (see Song 3:8).<br>
 <a name="fn3326" href="psa.htm#fnB3326"><sup>10</sup></a><b>sn</b> (91:6)  As in Deut 32:23-24, vv. 5-6 closely associate military attack and deadly disease.

 <a name="fn3379" href="psa.htm#fnB3379"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (94:6)  The Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;wty</FONT> refers to one who has lost his father (not necessarily his mother, see Ps 109:9). Because they were so vulnerable and were frequently exploited, fatherless children are often mentioned as epitomizing the oppressed (see Pss 10:14; 68:5; 82:3; 146:9; as well as Job 6:27; 22:9; 24:3, 9; 29:12; 31:17, 21).<br>

Hebrew wisdom literature often assumes and reflects the male-oriented perspective of ancient Israelite society. The principle of the psalm is certainly applicable to all people, regardless of their gender or age. To facilitate modern application, we translate the gender and age specific "man" with the more neutral "one." The generic masculine pronoun is used in v. 2.  <br>

 <a name="fn3391" href="psa.htm#fnB3391"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (94:15)  <i>Heb</i> "all the pure of heart." The "heart" is here viewed as the seat of one's moral character and motives. The "pure of heart" are God's faithful followers who trust in and love the LORD and, as a result, experience his deliverance (see Pss 7:10; 11:2; 32:11; 36:10; 64:10; 97:11).<br>

Synonyms are joined here to emphasize the degree of "darkness" experienced by the exiles. The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twmlx</FONT> ("deep darkness") has traditionally been understood as a compound noun, meaning "shadow of death" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lx@</FONT> + <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tw\m*</FONT>, see BDB 853; cf. NASB). Other authorities prefer to vocalize the form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tWml=x</FONT> and understand it as an abstract noun (from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;lx</FONT>) meaning "darkness." An examination of the word's usage favors the latter derivation. It is frequently associated with darkness/night and contrasted with light/morning (see Job 3:5; 10:21-22; 12:22; 24:17; 28:3; 34:22; Ps 107:10, 14; Isa 9:1; Jer 13:16; Amos 5:8). In some cases the darkness described is associated with the realm of death (Job 10:21-22; 38:17), but this is a metaphorical application of the word and does not reflect its inherent meaning. In Ps 107:10 the word refers metonymically to a dungeon, which in turn metaphorically depicts the place of Israel's exile (see vv. 2-3).<br>

(The use of prefixed forms with <i>vav</i> consecutive in vv. 36-37 favor this.) The psalmist may return to the theme of God's intervention for the exiles (see vv. 4-22, especially vv. 4-9). However, many regard vv. 33-41 as a hymnic description which generalizes about God's activities among men. In this case it would be preferable to use the English present tense throughout (cf.

 <a name="fn3785" href="psa.htm#fnB3785"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (107:38)  "Bless" here carries the nuance "endue with sexual potency, make fertile." See Gen 1:28, where the statement "he blessed them" directly precedes the command "be fruitful and populate the earth" (see also 1:22). The verb "bless" carries this same nuance in Gen 17:16 (where God's blessing of Sarai imparts to her the capacity to bear a child); 48:16 (where God's blessing of Joseph's sons is closely associated with their having numerous descendants); and Deut 7:13 (where God's blessing is associated with fertility in general, including numerous descendants). See also Gen 49:25 (where Jacob uses the noun derivative in referring to "blessings of the breast and womb," an obvious reference to fertility) and Gen 27:27 (where the verb is used of a field to which God has given the capacity to produce vegetation).<br>

Without such clarification, one might think that v. 39 refers to those just mentioned in v. 38 as objects of divine blessing, which would contradict the point just emphasized by the psalmist. The structure of vv. 33-42 is paneled (A-B-A-B). In vv. 33-34 the psalmist describes God's judgment upon his enemies (perhaps those who had enslaved his people). In vv. 35-38 he contrasts this judgment with the divine blessing poured out on God's people. (See the note on the word "people" in v. 35.) In vv. 39-40 he contrasts this blessing with the judgment experienced by enemies, before returning in vv. 41-42 to the blessing experienced by God's people.<br>

However, it could be taken as generalizing (in which case one should translate using the English present tense), in which case the psalmist moves from narrative to present reality. Perhaps the participial form appears because the statement is lifted from Job 12:21.<br>

Some attribute this curse-list to the psalmist's enemies rather than the psalmist. In this case one should paraphrase v. 6: "They say about me, `Appoint an evil man, etc.'" Those supporting this line of interpretation point out that vv. 2-5 and 20 refer to the enemies' attack on the psalmist being a verbal one. Furthermore in vv. 1-5, 20 the psalmist speaks of his enemies in the plural, while vv. 6-19 refer to an individual. This use of the singular in vv. 6-19 could be readily explained if this is the psalmist's enemies' curse on him. However, it is much more natural to understand vv. 6-19 as the psalmist's prayer against his enemies. There is no introductory quotation formula in v. 6 to indicate that the psalmist is quoting anyone, and the statement "may the LORD repay my accusers in this way" in v. 20 most naturally appears to be a fitting conclusion to the prayer in vv. 6-19. But what about the use of the singular in vv. 6-19? Often in the psalms the psalmist will describe his enemies as a group, but then speak of them as an individual as well, as if viewing his adversaries collectively as one powerful foe. See, for example, Ps 7, where the psalmist uses both the plural (vv. 1, 6) and the singular (vv. 2, 4-5) in referring to enemies. Perhaps by using the singular in such cases, the psalmist wants to single out each enemy for individual attention, or perhaps he has one especially hostile enemy in mind who epitomizes the opposition of the whole group. This may well be the case in Ps 109. Perhaps we should understand the singular throughout vv. 6-19 in the sense of "each and every one." For a lengthy and well-reasoned defense of the opposite view--that vv. 6-19 are a quotation of what the enemies said about the psalmist--see L. Allen, <i>Psalms 101-150</i>, 72-73.<br>

A reference to the evil man experiencing a curse seems premature here, for the psalmist is asking God to bring judgment on his enemies. For this reason some (cf.

The prefixed form with <i>vav</i> consecutive in the next line is emended in the same way and translated, "may it be far from him."

David himself instructed the Levites to bring the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem (1 Chr 15:11-15), joined the procession, offered sacrifices, wore a priestly ephod, and blessed the people (2 Sam 6:12-19).

In this case "the LORD" is the subject of the third person verbs throughout vv. 5-7 and is depicted as a warrior in a very anthropomorphic manner. In this case the LORD is pictured as being at the psalmist's right hand (just the opposite of v. 1). See Pss 16:8; 121:5.

The third masculine plural pronominal suffix must refer back to the "precepts" mentioned in v. 7. In the translation the referent has been specified for clarity. The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwf lkc</FONT> also occurs in Prov 3:4; 13:15 and 2 Chr 30:22.<br>

 <a name="fn3914" href="psa.htm#fnB3914"><sup>18</sup></a><b>sn</b> (111:10)  <i>Psalm 112</i>. This wisdom psalm lists some of the benefits of living a godly life. The psalm is an acrostic. After the introductory call to praise, every poetic line (twenty-two in all) begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.<br>
 <a name="fn3915" href="psa.htm#fnB3915"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (112:1)  <i>Heb</i> "[Oh] the happiness [of] the man." Hebrew wisdom literature often assumes and reflects the male-oriented perspective of ancient Israelite society. The individual is representative of a larger group, called the "godly" in vv. 3-4. The principle of the psalm is certainly applicable to all people, regardless of their gender. To facilitate modern application, we translate the gender specific "man" with the more neutral "one." The generic masculine pronoun is used in the following verses.<br>
 <a name="fn3916" href="psa.htm#fnB3916"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (112:1)  <i>Heb</i> "fears."<br>
 <a name="fn3917" href="psa.htm#fnB3917"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (112:1)  <i>Heb</i> "in his commands he delights very much." The words "in keeping" are supplied in the translation for clarification. Taking delight in the law is metonymic here for obeying God's moral will. See Ps 1:2.<br>
 <a name="fn3918" href="psa.htm#fnB3918"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (112:2)  Or "offspring"; <i>Heb</i> "seed."<br>
 <a name="fn3919" href="psa.htm#fnB3919"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (112:2)  <i>Heb</i> "His seed will be mighty on the earth, the generation of the godly." The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rwd</FONT> ("generation") could be taken as parallel to "offspring" and translated "posterity," but the singular more likely refers to the godly as a class. See BDB 190 for other examples where "generation" refers to a class of people.<br>
 <a name="fn3920" href="psa.htm#fnB3920"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (112:3)  <i>Heb</i> "stands forever."<br>
 <a name="fn3921" href="psa.htm#fnB3921"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (112:4)  In this context "light" symbolizes divine blessing in its various forms (see v. 2), including material prosperity and stability.<br>
 <a name="fn3922" href="psa.htm#fnB3922"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (112:4)  <i>Heb</i> "merciful and compassionate and just." The Hebrew text has three singular adjectives, which are probably substantival and in apposition to the "godly" (which is plural, however). By switching to the singular, the psalmist focuses on each individual member of the group known as the "godly." Note how vv. 5-9, like vv. 1-2a, use the singular to describe the representative godly individual who typifies the whole group.<br>
 <a name="fn3923" href="psa.htm#fnB3923"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (112:5)  <i>Heb</i> "man."<br>

 <a name="fn3927" href="psa.htm#fnB3927"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (112:7)  The passive participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">j^f%B*</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">j^WfB*</FONT>] expresses a state that results from the subject's action. See Isa 26:3.<br>

 <a name="fn3931" href="psa.htm#fnB3931"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (112:9)  <i>Heb</i> "his horn will be lifted up in honor." The horn of an ox underlies the metaphor (see Deut 33:17; 1 Kgs 22:11; Ps 92:10). The horn of the wild ox is frequently a metaphor for military strength; the idiom "exalt/lift up the horn" signifies military victory (see 1 Sam 2:10; Pss 89:17, 24; 92:10; Lam 2:17).<br>
 <a name="fn3932" href="psa.htm#fnB3932"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (112:10)  The Hebrew text uses the singular; the representative wicked individual is in view as typifying the group (note the use of the plural form in v. 10).<br>
 <a name="fn3933" href="psa.htm#fnB3933"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (112:10)  <i>Heb</i> "his teeth he will gnash." In Pss 35:16 and 37:12 this action is associated with a vicious attack.<br>
 <a name="fn3934" href="psa.htm#fnB3934"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (112:10)  This could mean that the desires of the wicked will go unfulfilled. Another possibility is that "desire" refers by metonymy to the object desired and acquired. In this case the point is that the wicked will lose what they desired so badly and acquired by evil means (see Ps 10:3).<br>
 <a name="fn3935" href="psa.htm#fnB3935"><sup>21</sup></a><b>sn</b> (112:10)  <i>Psalm 113</i>. The psalmist praises God as the sovereign king of the world who reaches down to help the needy.<br>
 <a name="fn3936" href="psa.htm#fnB3936"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (113:3)  <i>Heb</i> "from the rising of the sun to its setting." The extent is not temporal ("from sunrise to sunset") but spatial ("from the place where the sun rises [the east] to the place where it sets [the west]." In the phenomenological language of OT cosmology, the sun was described as rising in the east and setting in the west.<br>

 <a name="fn3950" href="psa.htm#fnB3950"><sup>7</sup></a><b>sn</b> (114:8)  <i>Psalm 115</i>. The psalmist affirms that Israel's God is superior to pagan idols and urges Israel to place their confidence in him.<br>

 <a name="fn3952" href="psa.htm#fnB3952"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (115:1)  The psalmist asks the LORD to demonstrate his <i>loyal love and faithfulness</i>, not simply so Israel may benefit, but primarily so that the LORD will receive honor among the nations, who will recognize, contrary to their present view (see v. 2), that Israel's God is committed to his people.<br>
 <a name="fn3953" href="psa.htm#fnB3953"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (115:3)  <i>He does whatever he pleases</i>. Such sovereignty is characteristic of kings (see Eccl 8:3).<br>

 <a name="fn3957" href="psa.htm#fnB3957"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (115:8)  <i>Heb</i> "will be." Another option is to take the prefixed verbal form as a prayer, "may those who make them end up like them." <br>

 <a name="fn3970" href="psa.htm#fnB3970"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (115:13)  <i>Heb</i> "the small along with the great." The translation assumes that "small" and "great" here refer to age (see 2 Chr 15:13). Another option is to translate "both the insignificant and the prominent" (see Job 3:19; cf. NEB "high and low alike").<br>
 <a name="fn3971" href="psa.htm#fnB3971"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (115:14)  <i>Heb</i> "may he add to you, to you and your sons." The prefixed verbal form is jussive, indicating this is a prayer.<br>

 <a name="fn3977" href="psa.htm#fnB3977"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (116:1)  <i>Heb</i> "I love because the LORD heard my volce, my pleas." It is possible that "the LORD" originally appeared directly after "I love" and was later accidentally misplaced. The translation assumes the prefixed verbal form is a preterite. The psalmist recalls that God heard his cry for help (note the perfect in v. 2a and the narrative in vv. 3-4).<br>

If retained, it refers to Sheol as a place where one is confined or severely restricted (cf. BDB 865, "<i>the straits</i> of Sheol"; NIV "the anguish of the grave"; NRSV "the pangs of Sheol"). However, <i>HALOT</i> 624 suggests an emendation to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ydxm</FONT> ("snares of") a rare noun attested in Job 19:6 and Eccl 7:26 (<i>HALOT</i> 622).

 <a name="fn3993" href="psa.htm#fnB3993"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (116:13)  <i>Heb</i> "a cup of deliverance I will lift up." Perhaps this alludes to a drink offering the psalmist will present as he thanks the LORD for his deliverance (see BDB 447). See v. 17.<br>
 <a name="fn3994" href="psa.htm#fnB3994"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (116:15)  <i>Heb</i> "precious in the eyes of the LORD [is] the death of his godly ones." The point is not that God delights in or finds satisfaction in the death of his followers! The psalmist, who has been delivered from death, affirms that the life-threatening experiences of God's followers get God's attention, just as a precious or rare object would attract someone's eye. See Ps 72:14 for a similar expression of this belief.<br>
 <a name="fn3995" href="psa.htm#fnB3995"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (116:16)  <i>Heb</i> "I am your servant, the son of your female servant." The phrase "son of a female servant" (see also Ps 86:16) is used of a son born to a secondary wife or concubine (Exod 23:12). In some cases the child's father is the master of the house (see Gen 21:10, 13; Judg 9:18). The use of the expression here certainly does not imply that the LORD has such a secondary wife or concubine! It is used metaphorically and idiomatically to emphasize the psalmist's humility before the LORD and his status as the LORD's servant.<br>

 <a name="fn4009" href="psa.htm#fnB4009"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (118:8)  "Taking shelter" in the LORD is an idiom for seeking his protection. Seeking his protection presupposes and even demonstrates the subject's loyalty to the LORD. In the psalms those who "take shelter" in the LORD are contrasted with the wicked and equated with those who love, fear, and serve the LORD (Pss 5:11-12; 31:17-20; 34:21-22).<br>

 <a name="fn4012" href="psa.htm#fnB4012"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (118:10)  Traditionally the verb has been derived from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lwm</FONT> ("to circumcise") and translated "[I] cut [them] off" (see BDB 557-58). However, it is likely that this is a homonym meaning "to fend off" (see <i>HALOT</i> 556) or "to push away." In this context, where the psalmist is reporting his past experience, the prefixed verbal form is best understood as a preterite. The phrase also occurs in vv. 11, 12.<br>
 <a name="fn4013" href="psa.htm#fnB4013"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (118:12)  <i>Heb</i> "were extinguished."<br>
 <a name="fn4014" href="psa.htm#fnB4014"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (118:12)  The point seems to be that the hostility of the nations (v. 10) is short-lived, like a fire that quickly devours thorns and then burns out. Some, attempting to create a better parallel with the preceding line, emend <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wkud</FONT> ("they were extinguished") to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wrub</FONT> ("they burned"). In this case the statement emphasizes their hostility.<br>
 <a name="fn4015" href="psa.htm#fnB4015"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (118:13)  <i>Heb</i> "pushing, you pushed me." The infinitive absolute emphasizes the following verbal idea. The psalmist appears to address the nations as if they were an individual enemy. Some find this problematic and emend the verb form (which is a Qal perfect second masculine singular with a first person singular suffix) to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ytyjdn</FONT>, a Niphal perfect first common singular, "I was pushed."<br>

The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">trmz </FONT>is traditionally understood as meaning "song" ("my strength and song [is] the LORD") in which case one might translate, "for the LORD gives me strength and joy" (i.e., a reason to sing). However, many recent commentators have argued that the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">trmz</FONT> is here a homonym, meaning "protection" or "strength." See <i>HALOT</i> 274; cf.

They are called "gates of justice" because they are the entrance to the just king's palace. This has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn4025" href="psa.htm#fnB4025"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (118:22)  Or "rejected."<br>

 <b>sn</b> (118:22)  The metaphor of the <i>stone...the builders discarded</i> describes the way in which God's deliverance reversed the psalmist's circumstances. When he was in distress, he was like a stone which was discarded by builders as useless, but now that he has been vindicated by God, all can see that he is of special importance to God, like the<i> cornerstone</i> of the building.<br>
 <a name="fn4027" href="psa.htm#fnB4027"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (118:23)  <i>Heb</i> "it is amazing in our eyes." The use of the plural pronoun here and in vv. 24-27 suggests that the psalmist may be speaking for the entire nation. However, it is more likely that vv. 22-27 are the people's response to the psalmist's thanksgiving song (see especially v. 26). They rejoice with him because his deliverance on the battlefield (see vv. 10-12) had national repercussions.<br>
 <a name="fn4028" href="psa.htm#fnB4028"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (118:24)  <i>Heb</i> "this is the day the LORD has made." Though sometimes applied in a general way, this statement in its context refers to the day of deliverance which the psalmist and people celebrate.<br>
 <a name="fn4029" href="psa.htm#fnB4029"><sup>30</sup></a><b>sn</b> (118:25)  A petition for deliverance and <i>success </i>seems odd in a psalm thanking God for deliverance, but it is not unique (see Ps 9:19-20). The people ask God to continue to intervene for them as he has for the psalmist.<br>
 <a name="fn4030" href="psa.htm#fnB4030"><sup>31</sup></a><b>sn</b> (118:26)  The people refer here to the psalmist, who enters the LORD's temple to thank him publicly (see vv. 19-21), as <i>the one who comes in the name of the </i>LORD.<br>
 <a name="fn4031" href="psa.htm#fnB4031"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (118:26)  The pronominal suffix is second masculine plural, but the final <i>mem</i> is probably dittographic (note the <i>mem</i> at the beginning of the following form) or enclitic, in which case the suffix may be taken as second masculine singular, referring to the psalmist.<br>
 <a name="fn4032" href="psa.htm#fnB4032"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (118:26)  <i>Heb</i> "from the house of the LORD."<br>
 <a name="fn4033" href="psa.htm#fnB4033"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (118:27)  <i>Heb</i> "and he has given us light." This may be an elliptical expression, with "his face" being implied as the object (see Num 6:25; Pss 31:16; 67:1; 80:3, 7, 19). In this case, "his face has given us light" = "he has smiled on us," or "he has shown us his favor." Another option (the one reflected in the translation) is that "light" here symbolizes divine blessing in the form of deliverance. "Light" is often used as a metaphor for deliverance and the life/blessings it brings. See Pss 37:6; 97:11; 112:4; Isa 49:6; 51:4; Mic 7:8. Some prefer to repoint the form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ra@y&#180;w+</FONT> (<i>vav</i> conjunctive + jussive) and translate the statement as a prayer, "may he give us light."<br>
 <a name="fn4034" href="psa.htm#fnB4034"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (118:27)  The Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gj</FONT> normally means "festival," but here it apparently refers metonymically to an offering made at the festival. BDB 291 interprets the word in this way here, citing as comparable the use of later Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hgygj</FONT>, which can refer to both a festival and a festival offering (see Jastrow, 424).<br>

 <a name="fn4038" href="psa.htm#fnB4038"><sup>39</sup></a><b>sn</b> (118:29)  <i>Psalm 119</i>. The psalmist celebrates God's law and the guidance it provides his people. He expresses his desire to know God's law thoroughly so that he might experience the blessings that come to those who obey it. This lengthy psalm exhibits an elaborate acrostic pattern. The psalm is divided into twenty-two sections (corresponding to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet), each of which is comprised of eight verses. Each of the verses in the first section (vv. 1-8) begins with the letter <i>alef</i>, the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. This pattern continues throughout the psalm as each new section highlights a successive letter of the alphabet. Each verse in section two (vv. 9-16) begins with the second letter of the alphabet, each verse in section three (vv. 17-24) with the third letter, etc. This rigid pattern creates a sense of order and completeness and may have facilitated memorization.  <br>

Some prefer to derive the verb from a homonym meaning "to place; to set" (see BDB 1001), but in this case an elliptical prepositional phrase must be understood, "I place your regulations [before me]" (see Ps 16:8).<br>

The psalmist wants to be able to give a reliable testimony about the LORD's loyal love (vv. 41-42), but if God does not intervene, the psalmist will be deprived of doing so, for the evidence of such love (i.e., deliverance) will be lacking.<br>

In this view these words were accidentally repeated from the previous verse. (2) However, it is possible that the psalmist closely associates the law with God himself because he views the law as the expression of the divine will. (3) Another option is that "lifting the hands" does not refer to prayer here, but to the psalmist's desire to receive and appropriate the law.<br>

See vv. 9, 16-17, 57, 101, 105, 130, 139 and 160-61. The reference in v. 86 to God's law being faithful favors this interpretation.

The psalmist addresses his deceptive enemies. The LORD is the understood subject of the verbs "give" and "add." The second part of the question echoes a standard curse formula, "thus the LORD/God will do . . . and thus he will add" (see Ruth 1:17; 1 Sam 3:17; 14:44; 20:13; 25:22; 2 Sam 3:9, 35; 19:13; 1 Kgs 2:23; 2 Kgs 6:31).<br>

 <a name="fn4262" href="psa.htm#fnB4262"><sup>10</sup></a><b>sn</b> (120:5)  <i>Meshech</i> was located in central Anatolia (modern Turkey; see <i>HALOT</i> 646). <i>Kedar</i> was located in the desert to east-southeast of Israel (see BDB 871). Because of the reference to Kedar, it is possible that Ps 120:5 refers to a different Meshech, perhaps one associated with the individual mentioned as a descendant of Aram in 1 Chr 1:17. (However, the LXX in 1 Chr 1:17 follows the parallel text in Gen 10:23, which reads "Mash," not Meshech.) It is, of course, impossible that the psalmist could have been living in both the far north and the east at the same time. For this reason one must assume that he is recalling his experience as a wanderer among the nations or that he is using the geographical terms metaphorically and sarcastically to suggest that the enemies who surround him are like the barbarians who live in these distant regions. For a discussion of the problem, see L. Allen, <i>Psalms 101-150</i>, 146.<br>
 <a name="fn4263" href="psa.htm#fnB4263"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (120:6)  The singular participial form probably has a representative function here. The psalmist envisions the typical hater of peace who represents the entire category of such individuals.<br>

 <a name="fn4266" href="psa.htm#fnB4266"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (120:7)  <i>Psalm 121</i>. The psalm affirms that the Lord protects his people Israel. Unless the psalmist addresses an observer (note the second person singular forms in vv. 3-8), it appears there are two or three speakers represented in the psalm, depending on how one takes v. 3. The translation assumes that speaker one talks in vv. 1-2, that speaker two responds to him with a prayer in v. 3 (this assumes the verbs are true jussives of prayer), and that speaker three responds with words of assurance in vv. 4-8. If the verbs in v. 3 are taken as a rhetorical use of the jussive, then there are two speakers. Verses 3-8 are speaker two's response to the words of speaker one. See the note on the word "sleep" at the end of v. 3.<br>

 <a name="fn4269" href="psa.htm#fnB4269"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (121:1)  The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/yam</FONT> is interrogative, not relative, in function. Rather than directly stating that his source of help descends from the hills, the psalmist is asking, "From where does my help come?" Nevertheless, the first line does indicate that he is looking toward the hills for help, probably indicating that he is looking up toward the sky in anticipation of supernatural intervention. The psalmist assumes the dramatic role of one needing help. He answers his own question in v. 2.<br>
 <a name="fn4270" href="psa.htm#fnB4270"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (121:2)  <i>Heb</i> "my help [is] from with the LORD."<br>

 <a name="fn4273" href="psa.htm#fnB4273"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (121:3)  The prefixed verbal forms following the negative particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la</FONT> appear to be jussives. As noted above, if they are taken as true jussives of prayer, then the speaker in v. 3 would appear to be distinct from both the speaker in vv. 1-2 and the speaker in vv. 4-8. However, according to GKC &#167;109.<i>e</i>), the jussives are used rhetorically here "to express the conviction that something cannot or should not happen" (see also BDB 39). In this case one should probably translate, "he will not allow your foot to slip, your protector will not sleep," and understand just one speaker in vv. 4-8.<br>

The reference to the <i>moon</i> may simply lend poetic balance to the verse, but it is likely that the verse reflects an ancient, primitive belief that the moon could have an adverse effect on the mind (note the English expression "moonstruck," which reflects such a belief). Another possibility is that the sun and moon stand by metonymy for harmful forces characteristic of the day and night, respectively.<br>

The text then reads literally, "Jerusalem, which is built like a city which has a company together."

 <a name="fn4325" href="psa.htm#fnB4325"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (126:1)  <i>Heb</i> "turns with a turning [toward] his people." The Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tbyv</FONT> occurs only here in the OT. For this reason many prefer to emend the form to the more common <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tybv</FONT> or <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twbv</FONT>, both of which are used as a cognate accusative of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwv</FONT> (see Ps 14:7). However an Aramaic cognate of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tbyv</FONT> appears in an eighth century B.C. Old Aramaic inscription with the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwv</FONT>. This cognate noun appears to mean "return" (see J. Fitzmyer, <i>The Aramaic Treaties of Sefire</i>, 119-20) or "restoration" (see <i>DNWSI</i>, 1125). Therefore it appears that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tbyv</FONT> should be retained and understood as a cognate accusative of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwv</FONT>. In addition to Fitzmyer (119-20) see L. Allen, who offers the literal translation, "turn with a turning toward" (L. Allen, <i>Psalms 101-150</i>, 170). Allen takes <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tbyv</FONT> as construct and understands "Zion" as an objective genitive.<br>
 <a name="fn4326" href="psa.htm#fnB4326"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (126:1)  <i>Heb</i> "we were like dreamers." This could mean the speakers were so overcome with ecstatic joy (see v. 3b) that they were like those who fantasize about pleasurable experiences in their sleep (see Isa 29:7-8). Since dreams are more commonly associated in the OT with prophetic visions (see BDB 321), the community may be comparing their experience of God's renewed favor to a prophet's receiving divine visions. Just as a prophetic dream sweeps the individual into a different dimension and sometimes brings one face-to-face with God himself (see Gen 28:11-15; 1 Kgs 3:5-15), so the community was aware of God's presence in a special way in the day of Zion's restoration. Though the MT as it stands makes good sense, some choose to understand a homonymic root here meaning "to be healthy; to be strong" (see BDB 321) and translate, "we were like those restored to health." This reading appears to have the support of several ancient translations as well as 11QPs<sup><sub>a</sub></sup>. See L. Allen, <i>Psalms 101-150</i>, 170-71, for a discussion of the viewpoints.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (126:4)  <i>The streams in the arid south</i>. Y. Aharoni writes of the streams in the Negev: "These usually dry wadis collect water on rainy days from vast areas. The situation is also aggravated by floods from the desert mountains and southern Judah. For a day or two or, more frequently, for only a few hours they turn into dangerous torrents" (Y. Aharoni, <i>The Land of the Bible</i>, 26). God's people were experiencing a "dry season" after a time of past blessing; they pray here for a "flash flood" of his renewed blessing. This does not imply that they are requesting only a brief display of God's blessing. Rather the point of comparison is the suddenness with which the wadis swell during a rain, as well as the depth and power of these raging waters. The community desires a sudden display of divine favor in which God overwhelms them with blessings.<br>
 <a name="fn4330" href="psa.htm#fnB4330"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (126:5)  O. Borowski  says regarding this passage: "The dependence on rain for watering plants, the uncertainty of the quantity and timing of the rains, and the possibility of crop failure due to pests and diseases appear to have kept the farmer in a gloomy mood during sowing" (<i>Agriculture in Iron Age Israel</i>, 54). Perhaps the people were experiencing a literal drought, the effects of which cause them to lament their plight as they plant their seed in hopes that the rain would come. However, most take the language as metaphorical. Like a farmer sowing his seed, the covenant community was enduring hardship as they waited for a new outpouring of divine blessing. Yet they are confident that a time of restoration will come and relieve their anxiety, just as the harvest brings relief and joy to the farmer.<br>

 <a name="fn4335" href="psa.htm#fnB4335"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (127:1)  The expression <i>build a house</i> may have a double meaning here. It may refer on the surface level to a literal physical structure in which a family lives, but at a deeper, metaphorical level it refers to building, perpetuating, and maintaining a family line. See Deut 25:9; Ruth 4:11; 1 Sam 2:35; 2 Sam 7:27; 1 Kgs 11:38; 1 Chr 17:10, 25. Having a family line provided security in ancient Israel.<br>
 <a name="fn4336" href="psa.htm#fnB4336"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (127:1)  The <i>city</i> symbolizes community security, which is the necessary framework for family security.<br>

 <a name="fn4338" href="psa.htm#fnB4338"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (127:2)  Here the Hebrew particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/k</FONT> is used to stress the following affirmation (see Josh 2:4; Ps 63:2).<br>
 <a name="fn4339" href="psa.htm#fnB4339"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (127:2)  <i>Heb</i> "he gives to his beloved, sleep." The translation assumes that the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">anv</FONT> ("sleep," an alternate form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnv</FONT>) is an adverbial accusative. The point seems to be this: Hard work by itself is not what counts, but one's relationship to God, for God is able to bless an individual even while he sleeps. (There may even be a subtle allusion to the miracle of conception following sexual intercourse; see the reference to the gift of sons in the following verse.) The statement is not advocating laziness, but utilizing hyperbole to give perspective and to remind the addressees that God must be one's first priority. Another option is to take "sleep" as the direct object: "yes, he gives sleep to his beloved" (cf. NIV, NRSV). In this case the point is this: Hard work by itself is futile, for only God is able to bless one with sleep, which metonymically refers to having one's needs met. He blesses on the basis of one's relationship to him, not on the basis of physical energy expended.<br>
 <a name="fn4340" href="psa.htm#fnB4340"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (127:3)  or "look."<br>
 <a name="fn4341" href="psa.htm#fnB4341"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (127:3)  Some prefer to translate this term with the gender neutral "children," but "sons" are plainly in view here, as the following verses make clear. Daughters are certainly wonderful additions to a family, but in ancient Israelite culture sons were the "arrows" that gave a man security in his old age, for they could defend the family interests at the city gate, where the legal and economic issues of the community were settled.<br>
 <a name="fn4342" href="psa.htm#fnB4342"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (127:4)  <i>Heb</i> "like arrows in the hand of a warrior, so [are] sons of youth." Arrows are used in combat to defend oneself against enemies; sons are viewed here as providing social security and protection (see v. 5). The phrase "sons of youth" is elliptical, meaning "sons [born during the father's] youth." Such sons will have grown up to be mature adults and will have children of their own by the time the father reaches old age and becomes vulnerable to enemies. Contrast the phrase "son of old age" in Gen 37:3 (see also 44:20), which refers to Jacob's age when Joseph was born.<br>
 <a name="fn4343" href="psa.htm#fnB4343"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (127:5)  Being "put to shame" is here metonymic for being defeated, probably in a legal context, as the reference to the city gate suggests.

 <a name="fn4362" href="psa.htm#fnB4362"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (129:4)  The background of the metaphor is not entirely clear.

But when God "cut the ropes" of their ox, as it were, they could no longer plow. The point of the metaphor seems to be that God took away the enemies' ability to oppress his people. See L.

The group who is speaking heard about the ark while they were in Ephrath. They then went to retrieve it from Kiriath-jearim ("Jaar").

The horn of the wild ox is frequently a metaphor for military strength; the idiom "exalt the horn" signifies military victory (see 1 Sam 2:10; Pss 89:17, 24; 92:10; Lam 2:17). In the ancient Near East powerful warrior-kings would sometimes compare themselves to a goring bull that used its horns to kill its enemies. For examples, see P.

However, the statement is odd and several emendations have been proposed. Some read, "for you have exalted over everything your name and your word," while others suggest, "for you have exalted over all the heavens your name and your word." The translation assumes an emendation of "your name" to "your heavens" (a construction that appears in Pss 8:3 and 144:5). The point is that God has been faithful to his promise and the reliability of that promise is apparent to all.  For a fuller discussion of these options, see L. Allen, Psalms 101-150, 244.<br>

The kidneys were sometimes viewed as the seat of one's emotions and moral character (see Pss 7:9; 26:2, as well as BDB 480). A number of translations, recognizing that "kidneys" does not communicate this idea to the modern reader, have generalized the concept: "inmost being" (NAB, NIV); "inward parts" (NASB, NRSV); "the delicate, inner parts of my body" (NLT). In the last instance, the focus is almost entirely on the physical body rather than the emotions or moral character. The present translation, by using a hendiadys (one concept expressed through two terms), links the concepts of emotion (heart) and moral character (mind).<br>

The text as it stands is syntactically problematic and makes little, if any, sense. The Niphal of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlP</FONT> occurs elsewhere only in Exod 33:16. Many take the form from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">alp</FONT> (see GKC &#167;75.<i>qq</i>), which in the Niphal perfect means "to be amazing" (see 2 Sam 1:26; Ps 118:23; Prov 30:18). Some, following the LXX and some other ancient witnesses, also prefer to emend the verb from first to second person, "you are amazing" (see L. Allen, <i>Psalms 101-150</i>, 249, 251). The present translation assumes the text conflates two variants: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yalpn</FONT>, the otherwise unattested masculine plural participle of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">alp</FONT>, and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twalpn</FONT>, the usual (feminine) plural form of the Niphal participle.

In later Hebrew the word refers to "a lump, a shapeless or lifeless substance," and to "unfinished matter, a vessel wanting finishing" (Jastrow, 222).

Elsewhere in the immediate context the psalmist expresses his amazement at the extent of God's knowledge about him (see vv. 1-6, 17b-18).<br>

The syntax of the Hebrew text is difficult and the meaning uncertain. The perfect verbal form is understood as rhetorical; the psalmist describes the anticipated downfall of the wicked as if it had already occurred. "Their judges" could be taken as the subject of the verb, but this makes little, if any, sense.

 <a name="fn4566" href="psa.htm#fnB4566"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (141:6)  It is unclear how this statement relates to the preceding sentence. Perhaps the judges are the referent of the pronominal subject ("they") of the verb "will listen," and "my words" are the referent of the pronominal subject ("they") of the phrase "are pleasant."

The reference to the "right hand" is probably a metonymy for an oath. When making an oath, one would raise the hand as a solemn gesture. See Exod 6:8; Num 14:30; Deut 32:40. The figure thus represents the making of false oaths (false promises).<br>

(For other examples of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> indicating purpose/result, see BDB 83 and <i>HALOT</i> 99.) If the psalmist--who appears to be a Davidic king preparing to fight a battle (see vv. 10-11)--is victorious, the whole nation will be spared invasion and defeat (see v. 14) and can flourish. Some prefer to emend the form to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yrva</FONT> ("how happy [are our sons]"). A suffixed noun sometimes follows <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yrva</FONT> (see 1 Kgs 10:8; Prov 20:7), but the presence of a comparative element (see "like plants") after the suffixed noun makes the proposed reading too awkward syntactically.<br>
