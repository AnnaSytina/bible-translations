<p><A NAME="1"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b><a name="fnB0" href="est_note.htm#fn0"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> The following events happened in the days of Ahasuerus.<a name="fnB1" href="est_note.htm#fn1"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> (I speak of that Ahasuerus who used to rule over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces extending all the way from India to Ethiopia.<a name="fnB2" href="est_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a>) 
<bqverse 2>2 In those days, as King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne in Susa<a name="fnB3" href="est_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> the citadel, 
<bqverse 3>3 in the third year of his reign he provided a banquet for all his officials and his servants. The army<a name="fnB4" href="est_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> of Persia and Media<a name="fnB5" href="est_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> was present,<a name="fnB6" href="est_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> as well as the nobles and the officials of the provinces. <p>

<bqverse 4>4 He displayed the riches of his royal glory and the splendor of his majestic greatness for a lengthy period of time<a name="fnB7" href="est_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a>--a hundred and eighty days, to be exact! 
<bqverse 5>5 When those days<a name="fnB8" href="est_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> were completed, the king then provided a seven-day<a name="fnB9" href="est_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> banquet for all the people who were present<a name="fnB10" href="est_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> in Susa the citadel, for those of highest standing to the most lowly.<a name="fnB11" href="est_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> It was held in the court located in the garden of the royal palace. 
<bqverse 6>6 The appointments included linen and purple curtains hung by cords of the finest linen<a name="fnB12" href="est_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> and purple wool on silver rings, alabaster columns, gold and silver couches<a name="fnB13" href="est_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> displayed on a surface made of valuable stones of alabaster, mother-of-pearl, and mineral stone. 
<bqverse 7>7 Drinks<a name="fnB14" href="est_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> were served in golden containers, all of which differed from one another. Royal wine was available in abundance at the king's expense. 
<bqverse 8>8 There were no restrictions on the drinking,<a name="fnB15" href="est_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> for the king had instructed all of his supervisors<a name="fnB16" href="est_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> that they should do as everyone so desired. 
<bqverse 9>9 Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in King Ahasuerus' royal palace.<a name="_Toc494012210"></a></p>
<p><i>Queen Vashti is Removed from Her Royal Position</i>
<p>
<bqverse 10>10 On the seventh day, as King Ahasuerus was feeling the effects of the wine,<a name="fnB17" href="est_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> he ordered Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs who attended him,<a name="fnB18" href="est_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11 to bring Queen Vashti into the king's presence wearing her royal high turban. He wanted to show the people and the officials her beauty, for she was very attractive. 
<bqverse 12>12 But Queen Vashti refused<a name="fnB19" href="est_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> to come at the king's bidding conveyed through the eunuchs. Then the king became extremely angry, and his rage consumed him.<p>

<bqverse 13>13 The king then inquired of the wise men who were discerners of the times--for it was the royal custom to confer with all those who were proficient in laws and legalities.<a name="fnB20" href="est_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14 Those who were closest to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan. These men were seven of the officials of Persia and Media who saw the king on a regular basis<a name="fnB21" href="est_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> and had the most prominent offices<a name="fnB22" href="est_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> in the kingdom. 
<bqverse 15>15 The king asked, "By law,<a name="fnB23" href="est_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> what should be done to Queen Vashti, in light of the fact that she has not obeyed the instructions of King Ahasuerus conveyed through the eunuchs?"<p>

<bqverse 16>16 Memucan then replied to the king and the officials, "The wrong of Queen Vashti is not against the king alone, but against all the officials and all the people who are throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus. 
<bqverse 17>17 For the matter concerning the queen will spread to all the women, leading them to treat their husbands with contempt, saying, `When King Ahasuerus gave orders to bring Queen Vashti into his presence, she would not come.' 
<bqverse 18>18 And this very day the noble ladies of Persia and Media who have heard the matter concerning the queen will respond in the same way to all the royal officials, and there will be more than enough contempt and anger! 
<bqverse 19>19 If the king is so inclined,<a name="fnB24" href="est_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> let a royal edict go forth from him, and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media that cannot be repealed,<a name="fnB25" href="est_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> that Vashti may not come into the presence of King Ahasuerus, and let the king convey her royalty to another<a name="fnB26" href="est_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> who is more deserving than she. 
<bqverse 20>20 And let the king's decision which he will enact be disseminated throughout all his kingdom, vast though it is.<a name="fnB27" href="est_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> Then all the women will give honor to their husbands, from the most prominent to the lowly."<p>

<bqverse 21>21 The matter seemed appropriate to the king and the officials. So the king acted on the advice of Memucan. 
<bqverse 22>22 He sent letters throughout all the royal provinces, to each province according to its script and to each people according to its language, that every man should be ruling in his family and should be speaking the language of his own people.<a name="fnB28" href="est_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqchapter 2>
<a name="_Toc494012211"></a></p>
<p><i>Esther Becomes Queen in Vashti's Place</i>
<p><A NAME="2"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> When this was done<a name="fnB29" href="est_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> and the rage of King Ahasuerus had diminished, he remembered<a name="fnB30" href="est_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> Vashti and what she had done and what had been decided against her. 
<bqverse 2>2 The king's servants who attended him said, "Let a search be conducted in the king's behalf for attractive young women.<a name="fnB31" href="est_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3 And let the king appoint officers throughout all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the attractive young women to Susa the citadel, to the harem<a name="fnB32" href="est_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> under the authority of Hegai, the king's eunuch who oversees the women, and let him provide whatever cosmetics they desire.<a name="fnB33" href="est_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4 Let the young woman whom the king finds most attractive become queen in place of Vashti." It seemed like a good idea to the king,<a name="fnB34" href="est_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> so he acted accordingly.<p>

<bqverse 5>5 Now there happened to be a Jewish man in Susa the citadel whose name was Mordecai.<a name="fnB35" href="est_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> He was the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjaminite, 
<bqverse 6>6 who had been taken into exile from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried into exile with King Jeconiah<a name="fnB36" href="est_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> of Judah, whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had taken into exile. 
<bqverse 7>7 Now he was acting as the guardian<a name="fnB37" href="est_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> of Hadassah<a name="fnB38" href="est_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> (that is, Esther), the daughter of his uncle, for neither her father nor mother were alive. This young woman was very attractive and had a beautiful figure.<a name="fnB39" href="est_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> When her father and mother died, Mordecai had raised her<a name="fnB40" href="est_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> as if she were his own daughter.<p>

<bqverse 8>8 It so happened that when the king's edict and his law became known many young women were taken to Susa the citadel to be placed under the authority of Hegai. Esther also was taken to the harem to be under the authority of Hegai, who was overseeing the women. 
<bqverse 9>9 This young woman pleased him, and she found favor with him. He quickly provided her with her cosmetics and her rations; he also provided her with the seven special young women who were from the palace. He then transferred her and her young women to the best part of the harem.<p>

<bqverse 10>10 Now Esther had not disclosed her people or her lineage, for Mordecai had instructed her not to do so. 
<bqverse 11>11 And day after day Mordecai used to walk back and forth in front of the court of the harem in order to learn how Esther was doing<a name="fnB41" href="est_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> and what might happen to her.<p>

<bqverse 12>12 At the end of the twelve months that were required for the women,<a name="fnB42" href="est_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> when the turn of each young woman arrived to go to King Ahasuerus-- 
<bqverse 13>13 for in this way they had to fulfill their time of cosmetic treatment: six months in oil of myrrh, and six months in perfume and various ointments used by women--the woman would go to the king in the following way: whatever she asked for would be provided for her to take with her from the harem to the palace. 
<bqverse 14>14 In the evening she went, and in the morning she returned back to the harem, to the authority of Shaashgaz the king's eunuch who was overseeing the concubines. She would not go back to the king unless the king was pleased with her<a name="fnB43" href="est_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> and she was requested by name.<p>

<bqverse 15>15 When it became the turn of Esther daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai (who had raised her as if she were his own daughter<a name="fnB44" href="est_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a>) to go to the king, she did not request a thing except for what Hegai the king's eunuch, who was overseer of the women, had recommended. Yet Esther met with the approval of all who saw her. 
<bqverse 16>16 Then Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus at his royal residence in the tenth<a name="fnB45" href="est_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> month (that is, Tebeth) in the seventh<a name="fnB46" href="est_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> year of his reign. 
<bqverse 17>17 And the king loved Esther more than all the other women, and she met with his loving approval<a name="fnB47" href="est_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> more than all the other young women.<a name="fnB48" href="est_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> So he placed the royal high turban on her head and appointed her queen<a name="fnB49" href="est_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> in place of Vashti. 
<bqverse 18>18 Then the king prepared a large banquet for all his officials and his servants--it was actually Esther's banquet. He also set aside a holiday for the provinces, and he provided for offerings at the king's expense.<a name="fnB50" href="est_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494012212"></a></p>
<p><i>Mordecai Learns of a Plot against the King</i>
<p>
<bqverse 19>19 Now when the young women were being gathered again,<a name="fnB51" href="est_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate.<a name="fnB52" href="est_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20 Esther was still not divulging her lineage or her people,<a name="fnB53" href="est_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> just as Mordecai had instructed her.<a name="fnB54" href="est_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> Esther continued to do whatever Mordecai said, just as she had done when he was raising her.<p>

<bqverse 21>21 In those days while Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, Bigthan<a name="fnB55" href="est_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> and Teresh,<a name="fnB56" href="est_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> two of the king's eunuchs who protected the entrance, got angry and plotted to assassinate<a name="fnB57" href="est_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> King Ahasuerus. 
<bqverse 22>22 When Mordecai learned of the conspiracy,<a name="fnB58" href="est_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> he informed Queen Esther,<a name="fnB59" href="est_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> and Esther told the king in Mordecai's behalf.<a name="fnB60" href="est_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23 The king then had the matter investigated and, finding it to be so, had the two conspirators<a name="fnB61" href="est_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> hanged on a gallows.<a name="fnB62" href="est_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> It was then recorded in the daily chronicles in the king's presence.
<bqchapter 3>
<a name="_Toc494012213"></a></p>
<p><i>Haman Conspires to Destroy the Jews</i>
<p><A NAME="3"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>Sometime later<a name="fnB63" href="est_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, exalting him and setting his position above that of all the officials who were with him. 
<bqverse 2>2  As a result, all the king's servants who were at the king's gate were bowing and paying homage to Haman, for the king had so commanded. However, Mordecai did not bow,<a name="fnB64" href="est_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> nor did he pay him homage.<p>

<bqverse 3>3  Then the servants of the king who were at the king's gate asked Mordecai, "Why are you violating the king's commandment?" 
<bqverse 4>4  And after they had spoken to him day after day without his paying any attention to them, they informed Haman to see whether this attitude on Mordecai's part would be permitted. Furthermore, he had revealed to them that he was a Jew.<p>

<bqverse 5>5  When Haman saw that Mordecai was not bowing or paying homage to him, he<a name="fnB65" href="est_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> was filled with rage. 
<bqverse 6>6  But the thought of striking out against<a name="fnB66" href="est_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> Mordecai alone was repugnant to him, for he had been informed of the identity of Mordecai's people.<a name="fnB67" href="est_note.htm#fn67"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> So Haman sought to destroy all the Jews (that is, the people of Mordecai)<a name="fnB68" href="est_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> who were in all the kingdom of Ahasuerus.<p>

<bqverse 7>7  In the first month (that is, the month of Nisan), in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus' reign, <i>pur</i> (that is, the lot) was cast before Haman in order to determine a day and a month.<a name="fnB69" href="est_note.htm#fn69"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> It turned out to be the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar).<p>

<bqverse 8>8  Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, "There is a particular people that is dispersed and spread throughout the inhabitants in all the provinces of your kingdom whose laws differ from those of all other peoples. Furthermore, they do not observe the king's laws. It is not appropriate for the king to provide a haven for them.<a name="fnB70" href="est_note.htm#fn70"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  If the king is so inclined, let an edict be issued to destroy them. I will pay ten thousand talents of silver<a name="fnB71" href="est_note.htm#fn71"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> to be conveyed to the king's treasuries for the officials who carry out this business."<p>

<bqverse 10>10  So the king removed his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, who was hostile toward the Jews. 
<bqverse 11>11  The king replied to Haman, "Keep your money,<a name="fnB72" href="est_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and do with those people whatever you wish."<p>

<bqverse 12>12  So the royal scribes were summoned in the first month, on the thirteenth day of the month. Everything Haman commanded was written to the king's satraps and governors who were in every province and to the officials of every people, province by province according to its script and people by people according to its language. In the name of King Ahasuerus it was written and sealed with the king's signet ring. 
<bqverse 13>13  Letters were sent by the runners to all the king's provinces stating that they should destroy, kill, and annihilate all the Jews, from youth to elderly, both women and children, on a particular day, namely the thirteenth day<a name="fnB73" href="est_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> of the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar), and to loot and plunder their possessions. 
<bqverse 14>14  A copy of this edict was to be presented as law throughout every province; it was to be made known to all the inhabitants, so that they would be prepared for this day. 
<bqverse 15>15  The messengers scurried forth with the king's order. The edict was issued in Susa the citadel. While the king and Haman sat down to drink, the city of Susa was in an uproar!<a name="fnB74" href="est_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqchapter 4>
<a name="_Toc494012214"></a></p>
<p><i>Esther Decides to Risk Everything in order to Help Her People</i>
<p><A NAME="4"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Now when Mordecai became aware of all that had been done, he<a name="fnB75" href="est_note.htm#fn75"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> tore his garments and put on sackcloth and ashes. He went out into the city, crying out in a loud<a name="fnB76" href="est_note.htm#fn76"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> and bitter voice. 
<bqverse 2>2 But he went no further than the king's gate, for no one was permitted to enter the king's gate clothed in sackcloth. 
<bqverse 3>3 Throughout each and every province where the king's edict and law were announced there was considerable mourning among the Jews, along with fasting, weeping, and sorrow. Sackcloth and ashes were characteristic<a name="fnB77" href="est_note.htm#fn77"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> of many. 
<bqverse 4>4 When Esther's female attendants and her eunuchs came and informed her about Mordecai's behavior,<a name="fnB78" href="est_note.htm#fn78"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> the queen was overcome with anguish. Although she sent garments for Mordecai to put on so that he could remove his sackcloth, he would not accept them. 
<bqverse 5>5 So Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs who had been placed at her service,<a name="fnB79" href="est_note.htm#fn79"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and instructed him to find out the cause and reason for Mordecai's behavior.<a name="fnB80" href="est_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6 So Hathach went to Mordecai at the plaza of the city in front of the king's gate. 
<bqverse 7>7 Then Mordecai related to him everything that had happened to him, even the specific amount of money that Haman had offered to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews to be destroyed. 
<bqverse 8>8 He also gave him a written copy of the law that had been disseminated<a name="fnB81" href="est_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> in Susa for their destruction so that he could show it to Esther and talk to her about it. He also gave instructions that she should go to the king to implore him and petition him in behalf of her people. 
<bqverse 9>9 So Hathach returned and related Mordecai's instructions to Esther.<p>

<bqverse 10>10 Then Esther replied to Hathach with instructions for Mordecai: 
<bqverse 11>11 "All the servants of the king and the people of the king's provinces know that there is only one law applicable<a name="fnB82" href="est_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> to any man or woman who comes uninvited to the king in the inner court--that person will be put to death, unless the king extends to him the gold scepter, permitting him to be spared.<a name="fnB83" href="est_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> Now I have not been invited to come to the king for some thirty days!"<p>

<bqverse 12>12 When Esther's reply was conveyed to Mordecai, 
<bqverse 13>13 he<a name="fnB84" href="est_note.htm#fn84"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> said to take back this answer to Esther: 
<bqverse 14>14 "Don't imagine that because you are part of the king's household you will be the one Jew who will escape.

<bqverse 15>15 Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai: 
<bqverse 16>16 "Go, assemble all the Jews who are found in Susa and fast in my behalf. Don't eat and don't drink for thirty days, night or day. My female attendants and I will also fast in the same way. Afterwards I will go to the king, even though it violates the law.<a name="fnB89" href="est_note.htm#fn89"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> If I perish, I perish!"<p>

<bqverse 17>17 So Mordecai set out to do everything that Esther had instructed him.

<p><i>Esther Appeals to the King for Help</i>
<p><A NAME="5"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> It so happened that on the third day Esther put on her royal attire and stood in the inner court of the palace, opposite the king's quarters.<a name="fnB90" href="est_note.htm#fn90"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> The king was sitting on his royal throne in the palace, opposite the entrance. 
<bqverse 2>2 When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she met with his approval.<a name="fnB91" href="est_note.htm#fn91"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> The king extended to Esther the gold scepter that was in his hand, and Esther approached the end of the scepter.<p>

<bqverse 3>3 The king said to her, "What is on your mind, Queen Esther? What is your request? Even as much as half the kingdom will be given to you!" <p>

<bqverse 4>4 Esther replied, "If the king is so inclined, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him."<p>

<bqverse 5>5 The king replied, "Find Haman quickly so that we can do as Esther requests."<p>
So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared. 
<bqverse 6>6 While at the banquet of wine, the king said to Esther, "What is your request? It shall be given to you. What is your petition? Ask for as much as half the kingdom,<a name="fnB92" href="est_note.htm#fn92"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> and it shall be done!"<p>

<bqverse 7>7 Esther responded, "My request and my petition is this: 
<bqverse 8>8 If I have found favor in the king's sight and if the king is inclined to grant my request and my petition, let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the banquet that I will prepare for them.

<p><i>Haman Expresses His Hatred of Mordecai</i>
<p>
<bqverse 9>9 Now Haman went forth that day pleased and very much encouraged.<a name="fnB95" href="est_note.htm#fn95"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> But when Haman saw Mordecai at the king's gate, and he did not rise nor tremble in his presence,<a name="fnB96" href="est_note.htm#fn96"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> Haman was filled with rage toward Mordecai. 
<bqverse 10>10 But Haman restrained himself and went on to his home.<p>
He then sent for his friends to join him, along with his wife Zeresh. 
<bqverse 11>11 Haman then recounted to them his fabulous wealth,<a name="fnB97" href="est_note.htm#fn97"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> his many sons, and how the king had magnified him and exalted him over the king's other officials and servants. 
<bqverse 12>12 Haman said, "Furthermore, Esther the queen invited<a name="fnB98" href="est_note.htm#fn98"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> only me to accompany the king to the banquet that she prepared! And also tomorrow I am invited along with the king. 
<bqverse 13>13 Yet all of this fails to satisfy me so long as I have to see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate."<p>

<bqverse 14>14 Haman's<a name="fnB99" href="est_note.htm#fn99"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, "Have a gallows seventy-five feet<a name="fnB100" href="est_note.htm#fn100"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> high built, and in the morning tell the king that Mordecai should be hanged on it. Then go satisfied with the king to the banquet."<p>
It seemed like a good idea to Haman, so he had the gallows built.

<a name="_Toc494012217"></a></p>
<p><i>The Turning Point: The King Honors Mordecai</i>
<p><A NAME="6"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Throughout that night the king was unable to sleep,<a name="fnB101" href="est_note.htm#fn101"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> so he asked for the book containing the historical records<a name="fnB102" href="est_note.htm#fn102"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> to be brought. As the records<a name="fnB103" href="est_note.htm#fn103"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> were being read in the king's presence, 
<bqverse 2>2 it was found written that Mordecai had disclosed that Bigthana<a name="fnB104" href="est_note.htm#fn104"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs who guarded the entrance, had plotted to assassinate<a name="fnB105" href="est_note.htm#fn105"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> King Ahasuerus.<p>

<bqverse 3>3 The king asked, "What great honor<a name="fnB106" href="est_note.htm#fn106"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> was bestowed on Mordecai because of this?" The king's attendants who served him responded, "Not a thing was done for him."<p>

<bqverse 4>4 Then the king said, "Who is in the courtyard?" Now Haman had come to the inner courtyard of the palace to suggest that the king hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had constructed for him. 
<bqverse 5>5 The king's attendants said to him, "It is Haman who is standing in the courtyard." The king said, "Let him enter."<p>

<bqverse 6>6 So Haman came in, and the king said to him, "What should be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor?" Haman thought to himself,<a name="fnB107" href="est_note.htm#fn107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> "Who is it that the king would want to honor more than me?" 
<bqverse 7>7 So Haman said to the king, "Let them bring royal attire which the king himself has worn for the man whom the king wishes to honor, 
<bqverse 8>8 and a horse on which the king himself has ridden--one on whose head the royal crown has been!<a name="fnB108" href="est_note.htm#fn108"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9 Then let this clothing and this horse be given to one of the king's noble officials. Let him<a name="fnB109" href="est_note.htm#fn109"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> then clothe the man whom the king wishes to honor, and let him lead him about through the plaza of the city on the horse, calling before him, `So shall it be done to the man whom the king wishes to honor!'"<p>

<bqverse 10>10 The king then said to Haman, "Go quickly! Take the clothing and the horse, just as you have described, and do as you just indicated to Mordecai the Jew who sits at the king's gate. Don't neglect<a name="fnB110" href="est_note.htm#fn110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> a single thing of all that you have said."<p>

<bqverse 11>11 So Haman took the clothing and the horse, and he clothed Mordecai. He led him about on the horse throughout the plaza of the city, calling before him, "So shall it be done to the man whom the king wishes to honor!" <p>

<bqverse 12>12 Then Mordecai again sat at the king's gate, while Haman hurried away to his home, mournful and with a veil over his head. 
<bqverse 13>13 Haman then related to his wife Zeresh and to all his friends everything that had happened to him. These wise men,<a name="fnB111" href="est_note.htm#fn111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> along with his wife Zeresh, said to him, "If indeed this Mordecai before whom you have begun to fall is Jewish, you will not be adequate for him. No, you will surely fall before him!" <p>

<bqverse 14>14 While they were still speaking with him, the king's eunuchs arrived. They quickly brought Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
<bqchapter 7>
<a name="_Toc494012218"></a></p>
<p><i>The King Has Haman Executed</i>
<p><A NAME="7"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> So the king and Haman came to dine<a name="fnB112" href="est_note.htm#fn112"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> with Queen Esther. 
<bqverse 2>2 Then on the second day of the banquet of wine the king asked Esther, "What is your request, Queen Esther? It shall be granted to you. And what is your petition? Ask up to half the kingdom, and it shall be done!" <p>

<bqverse 3>3 Queen Esther replied, "If I have met with your approval, O king, and if the king is so inclined, grant me my life as my request, and my people as my petition. 
<bqverse 4>4 For we have been sold--both I and my people--to destruction and to slaughter and to annihilation! If we had simply been sold as male and female slaves, I would have remained silent, for such distress would not have been sufficient for troubling the king."<p>

<bqverse 5>5 Then King Ahasuerus responded<a name="fnB113" href="est_note.htm#fn113"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> to Queen Esther, "Who is this individual? Where is this person to be found who is presumptuous enough<a name="fnB114" href="est_note.htm#fn114"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> to act in this way?"<p>

<bqverse 6>6 Esther replied, "The oppressor and enemy is this evil Haman!"<p>
Then Haman became terrified in the presence of the king and queen. 
<bqverse 7>7 In rage the king arose from the banquet of wine and withdrew to the palace garden. Meanwhile, Haman stood to beg Esther the queen for his life,<a name="fnB115" href="est_note.htm#fn115"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> for he realized that the king had now determined a catastrophic end for him.<p>

<bqverse 8>8 When the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet of wine, Haman was throwing himself down<a name="fnB116" href="est_note.htm#fn116"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> on the couch where Esther was lying.<a name="fnB117" href="est_note.htm#fn117"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> The king exclaimed, "Will he also attempt to rape the queen while I am still in the building!"<p>
As these words left the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face. 
<bqverse 9>9 Harbona, one of the king's eunuchs, said, "Indeed, there is the gallows that Haman made for Mordecai, who spoke out in the king's behalf. It stands near Haman's home and is seventy-five feet<a name="fnB118" href="est_note.htm#fn118"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> high."<p>
The king said, "Hang him on it!" 
<bqverse 10>10 So they hanged Haman on the very gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. The king's rage then abated.
<bqchapter 8>
<a name="_Toc494012219"></a></p>
<p><i>The King Acts to Protect the Jews</i>
<p><A NAME="8"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> On that same day King Ahasuerus gave the estate<a name="fnB119" href="est_note.htm#fn119"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> of Haman, that adversary of the Jews, to Queen Esther. Now Mordecai had come before the king, for Esther had revealed how he was related to her. 
<bqverse 2>2 The king then removed the signet ring (the very one he had taken back from Haman) and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther designated Mordecai to be in charge of Haman's estate.<p>

<bqverse 3>3 Then Esther again spoke with the king, falling at his feet. She wept and begged him for mercy, that he might nullify the evil of Haman the Agagite which he had intended against the Jews. 
<bqverse 4>4 When the king extended to Esther the gold scepter, she<a name="fnB120" href="est_note.htm#fn120"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> arose and stood before the king. <p>

<bqverse 5>5 She said, "If the king is so inclined and if I have met with his approval and if the matter is agreeable to the king and if I am attractive to him, let an edict be written rescinding those recorded intentions of Haman the son of Hamadatha, the Agagite,<a name="fnB121" href="est_note.htm#fn121"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> which he wrote in order to destroy the Jews who are throughout all the king's provinces. 
<bqverse 6>6 For how can I watch the calamity that will befall my people, and how can I watch the destruction of my relatives?"<a name="fnB122" href="est_note.htm#fn122"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 7>7 King Ahasuerus replied to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, "Look, I have already given Haman's estate to Esther, and he has been hanged on the gallows because he struck out<a name="fnB123" href="est_note.htm#fn123"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> against the Jews. 
<bqverse 8>8 Now you write in the king's name whatever in your opinion is appropriate concerning the Jews and seal it with the king's signet ring. Any decree that is written in the king's name and sealed with the king's signet ring cannot be rescinded.<p>

<bqverse 9>9 The king's scribes were quickly<a name="fnB124" href="est_note.htm#fn124"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> summoned--in the third month (that is, the month of Sivan), on the twenty-third day. They wrote out everything that Mordecai instructed to the Jews and to the satraps and the governors and the officials of the provinces all the way from India to Ethiopia<a name="fnB125" href="est_note.htm#fn125"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a>-- a hundred and twenty-seven provinces in all--to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language, and to the Jews according to their own script and their own language. 
<bqverse 10>10 Mordecai<a name="fnB126" href="est_note.htm#fn126"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed it with the king's signet ring. He then sent letters by couriers on horses, who rode royal horses that were very swift.<p>

<bqverse 11>11 The king thereby allowed the Jews who were in every city to assemble and to stand up for themselves--to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate any army of whatever people or province that should become their adversaries, including their children and women, and to confiscate their property. 
<bqverse 12>12 This was to take place on a certain day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus--namely, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar). 
<bqverse 13>13 A copy of the edict was to be presented as law throughout each and every province and made known to all peoples, so that the Jews might be prepared on that day to avenge themselves from their enemies. <p>

<bqverse 14>14 The couriers who were riding the royal horses went forth with the king's edict without delay.<a name="fnB127" href="est_note.htm#fn127"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> And the law was presented in Susa the citadel as well.<p>

<bqverse 15>15 Now Mordecai went out from the king's presence in purple and white royal attire, with a large golden crown and a purple linen mantle. The city of Susa shouted with joy.<a name="fnB128" href="est_note.htm#fn128"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16 For the Jews there was radiant happiness and joyous honor.<a name="fnB129" href="est_note.htm#fn129"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17 Throughout every province and throughout every city where the king's edict and his law came, the Jews experienced happiness and joy, banquets and holidays. Many of the resident peoples pretended<a name="fnB130" href="est_note.htm#fn130"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> to be Jews, because the fear of the Jews had overcome them.<a name="fnB131" href="est_note.htm#fn131"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqchapter 9>
<a name="_Toc494012220"></a></p>
<p><i>The Jews Prevail over Their Enemies</i>
<p><A NAME="9"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> In the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar), on its thirteenth day, the edict of the king and his law were to be executed. It was on this day that the enemies of the Jews had supposed that they would gain power over them. But contrary to expectations, the Jews gained power over their enemies. 
<bqverse 2>2 The Jews assembled themselves in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to strike out against those who were seeking their harm. No one was able to stand before them, for dread of them fell on all the peoples. 
<bqverse 3>3 All the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors and those who performed the king's business were assisting the Jews, for the dread of Mordecai fell on them. 
<bqverse 4>4 Mordecai was high-ranking<a name="fnB132" href="est_note.htm#fn132"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> in the king's palace, and word about him was spreading throughout all the provinces. His influence continued to become greater and greater.<p>

<bqverse 5>5 The Jews struck all their enemies with the sword, bringing death and destruction, and they did as they pleased with their enemies. 
<bqverse 6>6 In Susa the citadel the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men. 
<bqverse 7>7 In addition, they also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 
<bqverse 8>8 Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 
<bqverse 9>9 Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha, 
<bqverse 10>10 the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. But they did not confiscate their property. <p>

<bqverse 11>11 On that same day the number of those killed in Susa the citadel was brought to the king's attention. 
<bqverse 12>12 Then the king said to Queen Esther, "In Susa the citadel the Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman! What then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? What is your request? It shall be given to you. What other petition do you have? It shall be done."<p>

<bqverse 13>13 Esther replied, "If the king is so inclined, let the Jews who are in Susa be permitted to act tomorrow also according to today's law, and let them hang the ten sons of Haman on the gallows."<p>

<bqverse 14>14  So the king issued orders for this to be done. A law was passed in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman were hanged. 
<bqverse 15>15  The Jews who were in Susa then assembled on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and they killed three hundred men in Susa. But they did not confiscate their property.<p>

<bqverse 16>16  The rest of the Jews who were throughout the provinces of the king assembled in order to stand up for themselves and to have rest from their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand<a name="fnB133" href="est_note.htm#fn133"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> of their adversaries, but they did not confiscate their property. 
<bqverse 17>17  All of this was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. They then rested on the fourteenth day and made it a day for banqueting and happiness.<a name="_Toc494012221"></a></p>
<p><i>The Origins of the Feast of Purim</i>
<p>
<bqverse 18>18  But the Jews who were in Susa assembled on the thirteenth and fourteenth days, and rested on the fifteenth, making it a day for banqueting and happiness. 
<bqverse 19>19  This is why the Jews who are in the rural country--those who live in rural cities--set aside the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a holiday for happiness, banqueting, holiday, and sending gifts to one another.<p>

<bqverse 20>20  Mordecai wrote these matters down and sent letters to all the Jews who were throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far, 
<bqverse 21>21  to have them observe the fourteenth and the fifteenth day of the month of Adar each year 
<bqverse 22>22  as the time when the Jews gave themselves rest from their enemies--the month when their trouble was turned to happiness and their mourning to a holiday. These were to be days of banqueting, happiness, sending gifts to one another, and providing for the poor.<p>

<bqverse 23>23  So the Jews committed themselves to continue what they had begun to do and to what Mordecai had written to them. 
<bqverse 24>24  For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised plans against the Jews to destroy them. He had cast <i>pur</i> (that is, the lot) in order to afflict and destroy them. 
<bqverse 25>25  But when the matter came to the king's attention, the king<a name="fnB134" href="est_note.htm#fn134"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> gave written orders that Haman's<a name="fnB135" href="est_note.htm#fn135"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> evil intentions that he had devised against the Jews should fall on his own head. He and his sons were hanged on the gallows. 
<bqverse 26>26  For this reason these days are known as <i>Purim</i>, after the name of <i>pur</i>. 
<bqverse 27>27  Therefore, because of the account found in this letter and what they had faced in this regard and what had happened to them, the Jews established as binding on themselves, their descendants, and all who joined their company that they should observe these two days without fail, just as written and at the appropriate time on an annual basis. 
<bqverse 28>28  These days were to be remembered and to be celebrated in every generation and in every family, every province, and every city. The Jews were not to fail to observe these days of Purim; the remembrance of them was not to cease among their descendants.<p>

<bqverse 29>29  So Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew wrote with full authority to confirm this second<a name="fnB136" href="est_note.htm#fn136"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> letter about Purim. 
<bqverse 30>30  Letters were sent<a name="fnB137" href="est_note.htm#fn137"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> to all the Jews in the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the empire of Ahasuerus--words of true peace<a name="fnB138" href="est_note.htm#fn138"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a>-- 
<bqverse 31>31  to establish these days of Purim in their proper times, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established, and just as they had established both for themselves and their descendants, matters pertaining to fasting and lamentation. 
<bqverse 32>32  Esther's command established these matters of Purim, and the matter was officially recorded.
