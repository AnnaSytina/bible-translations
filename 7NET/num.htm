<p><i>The Exemption of the Levites</i>

<bqverse 50>50  But appoint<a name="fnB49" href="num_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony,<a name="fnB50" href="num_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> over all its furnishings and over everything in it.

<bqverse 51>51  Whenever the tabernacle is to move,<a name="fnB53" href="num_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> the Levites must take it down, and whenever the tabernacle is to be reassembled,<a name="fnB54" href="num_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> the Levites must put it up.<a name="fnB55" href="num_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> Any unauthorized person<a name="fnB56" href="num_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> who approaches it must be killed.<p>

<bqverse 52>52  And the Israelites will camp according to their divisions, each man in his camp, and each man by his standard. 
<bqverse 53>53  But the Levites must camp around the tabernacle of the testimony, so that divine anger<a name="fnB57" href="num_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> will not fall on the Israelite community. The Levites are responsible for the care<a name="fnB58" href="num_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> of the tabernacle of the testimony."<p>

<bqverse 54>54  The Israelites did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses--that is what they did.

<p><i>The Numbering of the Levites</i>

<bqverse 18>18  And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei. 
<bqverse 19>19  And the sons of Kohath by their families were: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. 
<bqverse 20>20 And the sons of Merari by their families were: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites by their clans.<a name="_Toc494011513"></a></p>
<p><i>The Numbering of the Gershonites</i>
<p>
<bqverse 21>21  From Gershon came the family of the Libnites and the family of the Shimnites; these were the families of the Gershonites. 
<bqverse 22>22  Those numbered of them, by the number of every male from a month old and upward--those numbered of them were 7,500. 
<bqverse 23>23  The families of the Gershonites were to camp behind the tabernacle toward the west. 
<bqverse 24>24  Now the leader<a name="fnB110" href="num_note.htm#fn110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> of the clan of the Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael.<p>

<bqverse 25>25  And<a name="fnB111" href="num_note.htm#fn111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> the responsibility of the Gershonites in the tent of meeting included the tabernacle, the tent with its covering, the curtain at the entrance of the tent of meeting,

<p><i>The Numbering of the Kohathites</i>
<p>
<bqverse 27>27  From Kohath came the family of the Amramites, the family of the Izharites, the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites; these were the families of the Kohathites.<a name="fnB114" href="num_note.htm#fn114"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  By the number of every male, from a month old and upward, there were 8,600. They were responsible for the care<a name="fnB115" href="num_note.htm#fn115"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> of the sanctuary. 
<bqverse 29>29  The families of the Kohathites were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle. 
<bqverse 30>30  Now the leader of the clan of the families of the Kohathites was Elizaphan son of Uzziel.<p>

<bqverse 31>31  And their responsibility included the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, and the utensils of the sanctuary with which they ministered,<a name="fnB116" href="num_note.htm#fn116"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> the curtain, and all their service.<a name="fnB117" href="num_note.htm#fn117"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 32>32  Now the head of all the levitical leaders<a name="fnB118" href="num_note.htm#fn118"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> was Eleazar son of Aaron the priest. He was appointed over those who were responsible<a name="fnB119" href="num_note.htm#fn119"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> for the sanctuary.<a name="_Toc494011515"></a></p>
<p><i>The Numbering of Merari</i>
<p>
<bqverse 33>33  From Merari came the family of the Mahlites and the family of the Mushites; these were<a name="fnB120" href="num_note.htm#fn120"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> the families of Merari. 
<bqverse 34>34  And those numbered of them, by the number of every male from a month old and upward, were 6,200. 
<bqverse 35>35  Now the leader of the clan of the families of Merari was Zuriel son of Abihail. These were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle.<p>

<bqverse 36>36  The appointed responsibility of the Merarites included the frames of the tabernacle, its crossbars, its posts, its sockets, its utensils, and all their service,<a name="fnB121" href="num_note.htm#fn121"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 37>37  and the pillars of the court all around, with their sockets, their pegs, and their ropes.<p>

<bqverse 38>38  But those who were to camp in front of the tabernacle on the east, in front of the tent of meeting, were Moses, Aaron<a name="fnB122" href="num_note.htm#fn122"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> and his sons. They were responsible for the needs<a name="fnB123" href="num_note.htm#fn123"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> of the sanctuary, and for the needs of the Israelites; but the unauthorized person who approached was to be put to death. 
<bqverse 39>39  All who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered by the word<a name="fnB124" href="num_note.htm#fn124"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> of the LORD, by their families, every male from a month old and upward, were 22,000.<a name="fnB125" href="num_note.htm#fn125"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494011516"></a></p>
<p><i>The Substitution for the Firstborn</i>
<p>
<bqverse 40>40  Then the LORD said to Moses, "Number all the firstborn males of the Israelites from a month old and upward, and take<a name="fnB126" href="num_note.htm#fn126"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> the number of their names. 
<bqverse 41>41 And take<a name="fnB127" href="num_note.htm#fn127"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> the Levites for me--I am the LORD--instead of all the firstborn among the Israelites, and the livestock of the Levites instead of all the firstborn of the livestock of the Israelites." 
<bqverse 42>42  So Moses numbered all the firstborn among the Israelites, as the LORD had commanded him. 
<bqverse 43>43  And every firstborn male, by the number of the names, from a month old and upward, according to those numbered of them, were 22,273.<p>

<bqverse 44>44  Then the LORD spoke to Moses: 
<bqverse 45>45  "Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the Israelites, and the livestock of the Levites instead of their livestock. And the Levites will be mine. I am the LORD. 
<bqverse 46>46  And for the redemption of the 273 of the firstborn of the Israelites who are more than the number of the Levites, 
<bqverse 47>47  collect<a name="fnB128" href="num_note.htm#fn128"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> five shekels for each<a name="fnB129" href="num_note.htm#fn129"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> one individually; you are to collect<a name="fnB130" href="num_note.htm#fn130"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> them in the currency of the sanctuary shekel, which is the shekel of twenty gerahs.<a name="fnB131" href="num_note.htm#fn131"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 48>48  And give the money for the redemption of the excess number of them to Aaron and his sons."<p>

<bqverse 49>49  So Moses took the redemption money<a name="fnB132" href="num_note.htm#fn132"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> from those who were in excess of those redeemed by the Levites. 
<bqverse 50>50  From the firstborn of the Israelites he collected the money, 1,365 shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary. 
<bqverse 51>51  And Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses.

<bqverse 2>2  Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of their clans, made an offering. They were the leaders of the tribes; they were the ones who had been supervising<a name="fnB288" href="num_note.htm#fn288"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> the numbering. 
<bqverse 3>3  They brought<a name="fnB289" href="num_note.htm#fn289"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> their offering before the LORD, six covered carts<a name="fnB290" href="num_note.htm#fn290"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and twelve oxen--one cart for every two of the leaders, and for each one an ox; and they presented them in front of the tabernacle.<a name="_Toc494011529"></a></p>
<p><i>The Distribution of the Gifts</i>
<p>
<bqverse 4>4  Then the LORD spoke to Moses: 
<bqverse 5>5  "Receive these<a name="fnB291" href="num_note.htm#fn291"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> from them, that they may be<a name="fnB292" href="num_note.htm#fn292"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> used in doing the work<a name="fnB293" href="num_note.htm#fn293"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> of the tent of meeting; and you must give them to the Levites, to every man<a name="fnB294" href="num_note.htm#fn294"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> as his service required."<a name="fnB295" href="num_note.htm#fn295"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 6>6  So Moses accepted the carts and the oxen and gave them to the Levites. 
<bqverse 7>7  Two carts and four oxen he gave to the Gershonites, as their service required; 
<bqverse 8>8  and four carts and eight oxen he gave to the Merarites, as their service required, under the authority of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest. 
<bqverse 9>9  But to the Kohathites he gave none, because the service of the holy things, which they carried<a name="fnB296" href="num_note.htm#fn296"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> on their shoulders, was their responsibility.<a name="fnB297" href="num_note.htm#fn297"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494011530"></a></p>

<bqverse 10>10  The leaders offered<a name="fnB298" href="num_note.htm#fn298"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> gifts<a name="fnB299" href="num_note.htm#fn299"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> for<a name="fnB300" href="num_note.htm#fn300"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> the dedication<a name="fnB301" href="num_note.htm#fn301"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> of the altar when it was anointed.<a name="fnB302" href="num_note.htm#fn302"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> And the leaders offered their offering before the altar. 
<bqverse 11>11  For the LORD said to Moses, "They must offer their offering, one leader for each day,<a name="fnB303" href="num_note.htm#fn303"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> for the dedication of the altar."<a name="_Toc494011531"></a></p>

<bqverse 89>89  Now when Moses went into<a name="fnB306" href="num_note.htm#fn306"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> the tent of meeting to speak with the LORD,<a name="fnB307" href="num_note.htm#fn307"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> he heard the voice speaking to him from above the cover<a name="fnB308" href="num_note.htm#fn308"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> that was on the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim;<a name="fnB309" href="num_note.htm#fn309"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> thus he spoke to him.

<p><i>Lighting the Lamps</i>
<p><A NAME="8"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b><a name="fnB310" href="num_note.htm#fn310"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> And the LORD spoke to Moses: 
<bqverse 2>2  "Speak to Aaron and tell him, `When you set up<a name="fnB311" href="num_note.htm#fn311"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> the lamps, the seven lamps are to give light<a name="fnB312" href="num_note.htm#fn312"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> in front of the lampstand.'"<p>

<bqverse 3>3  And Aaron did so; he set up the lamps to face toward the front of the lampstand, as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<bqverse 4>4 And this is how the lampstand was made:<a name="fnB313" href="num_note.htm#fn313"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> it was beaten work in gold;<a name="fnB314" href="num_note.htm#fn314"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> from its shaft to its flowers it was beaten work. According to the pattern which the LORD had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand.<a name="_Toc494011534"></a></p>
<p><i>The Separation of the Levites</i>
<p>
<bqverse 5>5  Then the LORD spoke to Moses: 
<bqverse 6>6  "Take the Levites from among the Israelites and purify<a name="fnB315" href="num_note.htm#fn315"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> them. 
<bqverse 7>7  And do this<a name="fnB316" href="num_note.htm#fn316"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> to them to purify them: sprinkle water of purification<a name="fnB317" href="num_note.htm#fn317"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> on them; then have them shave<a name="fnB318" href="num_note.htm#fn318"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> all their body and wash<a name="fnB319" href="num_note.htm#fn319"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> their clothes, and so purify themselves.<a name="fnB320" href="num_note.htm#fn320"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8 Then they are to take a young bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with olive oil; and you are to take a second young bull for a purification offering.<a name="fnB321" href="num_note.htm#fn321"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  And you are to bring the Levites before the tent of meeting, and assemble the entire community of the Israelites. 
<bqverse 10>10  Then you are to bring the Levites before the LORD, and the Israelites are to lay their hands on the Levites;<a name="fnB322" href="num_note.htm#fn322"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  and Aaron is to offer<a name="fnB323" href="num_note.htm#fn323"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> the Levites before the LORD as a waved offering from the Israelites, that they may do the work<a name="fnB324" href="num_note.htm#fn324"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> of the LORD. 
<bqverse 12>12 When<a name="fnB325" href="num_note.htm#fn325"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> the Levites lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, offer<a name="fnB326" href="num_note.htm#fn326"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> the one for a purification offering and the other for a whole burnt offering to the LORD,<a name="fnB327" href="num_note.htm#fn327"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> to make atonement for the Levites. 
<bqverse 13>13  And you are to have the Levites stand before Aaron<a name="fnB328" href="num_note.htm#fn328"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> and his sons, and then offer them as a waved offering to the LORD. 
<bqverse 14>14  And so<a name="fnB329" href="num_note.htm#fn329"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> you are to separate the Levites from among the Israelites, and the Levites will be mine. <p>

<bqverse 15>15  "And after this, the Levites will go in<a name="fnB330" href="num_note.htm#fn330"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> to do the work<a name="fnB331" href="num_note.htm#fn331"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> of the tent of meeting. So you must cleanse them<a name="fnB332" href="num_note.htm#fn332"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> and offer them like a wave offering.<a name="fnB333" href="num_note.htm#fn333"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  For they are entirely given<a name="fnB334" href="num_note.htm#fn334"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> to me from among the Israelites. I have taken them for myself instead of<a name="fnB335" href="num_note.htm#fn335"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> all who open the womb, the firstborn of all the Israelites. 
<bqverse 17>17  For all the firstborn among the Israelites are mine, both human being and animal; when I destroyed<a name="fnB336" href="num_note.htm#fn336"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I set them apart for myself. 
<bqverse 18>18  So I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the Israelites. 
<bqverse 19>19  And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the Israelites, to do the work for the Israelites in the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the Israelites, so there will be no plague among the Israelites when the Israelites come near the sanctuary."<a name="fnB337" href="num_note.htm#fn337"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 20>20  So Moses and Aaron and the entire community of the Israelites did this with the Levites: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, this is what the Israelites did with them. 
<bqverse 21>21  And the Levites purified themselves<a name="fnB338" href="num_note.htm#fn338"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> and washed their clothing; then Aaron presented them like a wave offering before the LORD, and Aaron made atonement for them to purify them. 
<bqverse 22>22  And after this, the Levites went in to do their work in the tent of meeting before Aaron and before his sons. As the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did.<a name="_Toc494011535"></a></p>
<p><i>The Work of the Levites</i>
<p>
<bqverse 23>23  Then the LORD spoke to Moses: 
<bqverse 24>24 "This is what pertains to the Levites:<a name="fnB339" href="num_note.htm#fn339"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a><b> </b>At the age of twenty-five years old<a name="fnB340" href="num_note.htm#fn340"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> and upward one may enter to join the company<a name="fnB341" href="num_note.htm#fn341"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> in the work of the tent of meeting; 
<bqverse 25>25  and at the age of fifty years they must retire from performing the work, and may no longer work. 
<bqverse 26>26  They may assist<a name="fnB342" href="num_note.htm#fn342"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> their colleagues<a name="fnB343" href="num_note.htm#fn343"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> in the tent of meeting, to attend to needs, but they must do no work. This is the way you must establish<a name="fnB344" href="num_note.htm#fn344"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> the Levites regarding their duties."

<p><i>The Response of God</i>
<p>
<bqverse 16>16 <a name="fnB471" href="num_note.htm#fn471"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> And the LORD said to Moses, "Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know are elders of the people, and officials<a name="fnB472" href="num_note.htm#fn472"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> over them; and bring them to the tent of meeting, and let them take their position there with you. 
<bqverse 17>17  Then I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take part of the Spirit that is on you, and will put it on them, and they will bear some of the burden of the people with you, so that you do not bear it<a name="fnB473" href="num_note.htm#fn473"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> by yourself. <p>

<bqverse 18>18  "And say to the people, `Sanctify yourselves<a name="fnB474" href="num_note.htm#fn474"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> for tomorrow, and you will eat meat, for you have wept in the hearing<a name="fnB475" href="num_note.htm#fn475"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> of the LORD, saying, "Who will give us meat to eat,<a name="fnB476" href="num_note.htm#fn476"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> for life<a name="fnB477" href="num_note.htm#fn477"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> was good for us in Egypt?" Therefore the LORD will give you meat, and you will eat. 
<bqverse 19>19  You will eat, not just one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days, 
<bqverse 20>20  but a whole month, until it comes out your nostrils and makes you sick,<a name="fnB478" href="num_note.htm#fn478"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> because you have despised<a name="fnB479" href="num_note.htm#fn479"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, "Why<a name="fnB480" href="num_note.htm#fn480"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> did we ever come out of Egypt?"'"<p>

<bqverse 21>21  And Moses said, "The people around me<a name="fnB481" href="num_note.htm#fn481"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> are six hundred thousand on foot;<a name="fnB482" href="num_note.htm#fn482"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> but you say, `I will give them meat,<a name="fnB483" href="num_note.htm#fn483"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> that they may eat<a name="fnB484" href="num_note.htm#fn484"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> for a whole month.' 
<bqverse 22>22  Would they have enough if the flocks and the herds were slain for them? If all the fish of the sea were caught for them, would they have enough?" 
<bqverse 23>23  And the LORD said to Moses, "Is the LORD's hand shortened?<a name="fnB485" href="num_note.htm#fn485"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> Now you will see whether my word to you will happen<a name="fnB486" href="num_note.htm#fn486"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> or not."<p>

<bqverse 24>24  So Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD. He then gathered seventy men of the elders of the people and had them stand around the tabernacle. 
<bqverse 25>25 And the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to them, and he took some of the Spirit that was on Moses<b>,</b><a name="fnB487" href="num_note.htm#fn487"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a><b> </b>and put it on the seventy elders.

<p><i>Eldad and Medad</i>
<p>
<bqverse 26>26 But two men remained in the camp; the name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad. And the Spirit rested on them. Now they were among those in the registration,<a name="fnB491" href="num_note.htm#fn491"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> but had not gone to the tabernacle. So they prophesied in the camp. 
<bqverse 27>27  And a<a name="fnB492" href="num_note.htm#fn492"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> young man ran and told Moses, and he said, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp." 
<bqverse 28>28  And Joshua son of Nun, the servant<a name="fnB493" href="num_note.htm#fn493"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> of Moses, one of his choice young men,<a name="fnB494" href="num_note.htm#fn494"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> answered and said, "My lord Moses, stop them!"<a name="fnB495" href="num_note.htm#fn495"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 29>29 And Moses said to him, "Are you envious for me?<a name="fnB496" href="num_note.htm#fn496"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> Oh that<a name="fnB497" href="num_note.htm#fn497"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> all the LORD's people were prophets, that the LORD would put his Spirit on them!" 
<bqverse 30>30  And Moses returned to the camp along with the elders of Israel.<a name="_Toc494011548"></a></p>
<p><i>Provision of Quail</i>
<p>
<bqverse 31>31  Now a wind <a name="fnB498" href="num_note.htm#fn498"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a>went forth<a name="fnB499" href="num_note.htm#fn499"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> from the LORD, and brought quail<a name="fnB500" href="num_note.htm#fn500"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a> from the sea, and let them fall<a name="fnB501" href="num_note.htm#fn501"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> near the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and about a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about three feet<a name="fnB502" href="num_note.htm#fn502"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a> high on the surface of the ground. 
<bqverse 32>32 And the people stayed up<a name="fnB503" href="num_note.htm#fn503"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>69</SUP></FONT></a> all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and gathered the quail. The one who gathered the least gathered ten homers,<a name="fnB504" href="num_note.htm#fn504"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>70</SUP></FONT></a> and they spread them out<a name="fnB505" href="num_note.htm#fn505"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>71</SUP></FONT></a> for themselves round about the camp. 
<bqverse 33>33  But while the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed,<a name="fnB506" href="num_note.htm#fn506"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>72</SUP></FONT></a> the anger of the LORD burned against the people, and the LORD struck the people with a very great plague. <p>

<bqverse 34>34  So the name of that place was called Kibroth Hattaavah,<a name="fnB507" href="num_note.htm#fn507"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>73</SUP></FONT></a> because there they buried the people that craved different food.<a name="fnB508" href="num_note.htm#fn508"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>74</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 35>35  And the people journeyed from Kibroth Hattaavah to Hazeroth, and they stayed at Hazeroth.

<bqverse 2>2  And they<a name="fnB513" href="num_note.htm#fn513"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> said, "Has the LORD only<a name="fnB514" href="num_note.htm#fn514"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> spoken by Moses?

<p><i>The Response of the LORD</i>
<p>
<bqverse 4>4  And the LORD spoke immediately to Moses, and to Aaron, and to Miriam, "The three of you come out to the tent of meeting." And the three of them came out. 
<bqverse 5>5  And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood at the entrance of the tent; he then called Aaron and Miriam, and they both came forward.<p>

<bqverse 6>6 And the LORD said, "Hear now my words: If there is a prophet among you,<a name="fnB518" href="num_note.htm#fn518"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> I the LORD will make myself known to him in a vision, I will speak with him in a dream. 
<bqverse 7>7  My servant<a name="fnB519" href="num_note.htm#fn519"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> Moses is not so; he is faithful<a name="fnB520" href="num_note.htm#fn520"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> in all my house. 
<bqverse 8>8  With him I will speak face to face,<a name="fnB521" href="num_note.htm#fn521"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> openly,<a name="fnB522" href="num_note.htm#fn522"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> and not in riddles; and he will see the form<a name="fnB523" href="num_note.htm#fn523"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?" 
<bqverse 9>9  And the anger of the LORD burned against them, and he departed. 
<bqverse 10>10  When<a name="fnB524" href="num_note.htm#fn524"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> the cloud departed from over the tent, Miriam became<a name="fnB525" href="num_note.htm#fn525"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> leprous<a name="fnB526" href="num_note.htm#fn526"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> as snow.

<p><i>The Intercession of Moses</i>

<bqverse 11>11  So Aaron said to Moses, "Oh my lord,<a name="fnB528" href="num_note.htm#fn528"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> please do not lay this sin upon us, in which we have acted foolishly and have sinned. 
<bqverse 12>12  Do not let her be like a dead person, whose flesh is half-consumed when he comes out of the mother's womb."<p>

<bqverse 13>13 Then Moses cried to the LORD, "Heal her now, O God." 
<bqverse 14>14  And the LORD said to Moses, "If her father had even spit<a name="fnB529" href="num_note.htm#fn529"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> in her face, would she not have been disgraced for seven days? Let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and afterward let her be received back in again.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  So Miriam was shut outside of the camp for seven days; and the people did not journey on until Miriam was brought back in.<a name="fnB530" href="num_note.htm#fn530"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 3>3  Why has the LORD brought us into this land only to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should become plunder? Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?" 
<bqverse 4>4  So they said to one another,<a name="fnB577" href="num_note.htm#fn577"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> "Let's appoint<a name="fnB578" href="num_note.htm#fn578"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> a leader<a name="fnB579" href="num_note.htm#fn579"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> and return<a name="fnB580" href="num_note.htm#fn580"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> to Egypt." <p>

<bqverse 6>6  And Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, part of those who investigated the land, tore their garments. 
<bqverse 7>7  They said to all the community of the Israelites, "The land we passed through to investigate is an exceedingly<a name="fnB582" href="num_note.htm#fn582"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> good land.

<bqverse 13>13  And Moses said to the LORD, "When the Egyptians hear<a name="fnB592" href="num_note.htm#fn592"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> it--for you brought up this people in your might from among them-- 
<bqverse 14>14  then they will tell it to the inhabitants<a name="fnB593" href="num_note.htm#fn593"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> of this land.

<bqverse 15>15 If you kill<a name="fnB595" href="num_note.htm#fn595"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> all this people at once,<a name="fnB596" href="num_note.htm#fn596"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> then the nations that have heard of your fame will say, 
<bqverse 16>16  `Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land that he swore to them, he killed them in the wilderness.' 
<bqverse 17>17  So now, let the power of my Lord<a name="fnB597" href="num_note.htm#fn597"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> be great, just as you have said,

<bqverse 24>24  Only my servant Caleb, because he had a different spirit and has followed me fully--I will bring him into the land where he had gone, and his descendants<a name="fnB609" href="num_note.htm#fn609"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> will possess it.

<bqverse 34>34  After the number of the days you have investigated this land, forty days, one day for a year, you will suffer for<a name="fnB623" href="num_note.htm#fn623"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> your iniquities, forty years, and you will know what it means to thwart me.<a name="fnB624" href="num_note.htm#fn624"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 35>35  I the LORD have said, `I will surely do so to all this evil community that has gathered together against me. In this wilderness they will be finished, and there they will die!'"<p>

<bqverse 36>36 And the men whom Moses sent to investigate the land, who returned and made all the community murmur against him by producing<a name="fnB625" href="num_note.htm#fn625"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> an evil report about the land, 
<bqverse 37>37 those men who produced the evil report about the land, died by the plague before the LORD. 
<bqverse 38>38  But Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephuneh, who were among<a name="fnB626" href="num_note.htm#fn626"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> the men who went to investigate the land, lived.

<bqverse 40>40 And early<a name="fnB629" href="num_note.htm#fn629"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> in the morning they went up to the crest of the hill country,<a name="fnB630" href="num_note.htm#fn630"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> saying, "Here we are, and we will go up to the place that the LORD commanded,<a name="fnB631" href="num_note.htm#fn631"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> for we have sinned."<a name="fnB632" href="num_note.htm#fn632"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 41>41  But Moses said, "Why<a name="fnB633" href="num_note.htm#fn633"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> are you now transgressing the commandment of the LORD? But it will not prosper. 
<bqverse 42>42  Do not go up, for the LORD is not among you, and you will be<a name="fnB634" href="num_note.htm#fn634"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> defeated before your enemies. 
<bqverse 43>43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and you will fall by the sword. Because you have turned away from the LORD, the LORD will not be with you."<p>

<bqverse 44>44  But they presumed<a name="fnB635" href="num_note.htm#fn635"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> to go up to the crest of the hill, although<a name="fnB636" href="num_note.htm#fn636"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> neither the ark of the covenant of the LORD nor Moses departed out of the camp. 
<bqverse 45>45  So the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country swooped<a name="fnB637" href="num_note.htm#fn637"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a> down and attacked them<a name="fnB638" href="num_note.htm#fn638"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> as far as Hormah.<a name="fnB639" href="num_note.htm#fn639"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 35>35  Then the LORD said to Moses, "The man must surely be put to death; all the congregation must stone<a name="fnB677" href="num_note.htm#fn677"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> him with stones outside the camp.

<bqverse 1>1 </b><a name="fnB684" href="num_note.htm#fn684"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> Now Korah son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth, Reubenites, took men<a name="fnB685" href="num_note.htm#fn685"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  and rose up against Moses, with some of the Israelites, two hundred fifty princes of the community, chosen from the assembly,<a name="fnB686" href="num_note.htm#fn686"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> famous men.<a name="fnB687" href="num_note.htm#fn687"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  And they assembled against Moses and Aaron, saying to them, "You take too much upon yourselves,<a name="fnB688" href="num_note.htm#fn688"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> seeing all the community is holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them. Why then do you lift yourselves above the community of the LORD?"<p>

<bqverse 4>4 When Moses heard it he fell down with his face to the ground. 
<bqverse 5>5  Then he said to Korah and to all his company, "In the morning the LORD will make known who are his, and who is holy. He will cause that person<a name="fnB689" href="num_note.htm#fn689"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> to approach him; the person he has chosen he will cause to approach him. 
<bqverse 6>6 Do this, Korah, you and all your<a name="fnB690" href="num_note.htm#fn690"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> company: Take censers, 
<bqverse 7>7  put fire in them, and set incense on them before the LORD tomorrow and the man whom the LORD chooses will be holy. You take too much upon yourselves, you sons of Levi." 
<bqverse 8>8  And Moses said to Korah, "Listen now, you sons of Levi! 
<bqverse 9>9 Does it seem too small a thing to you that the God of Israel has separated you from the community of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD and to stand before the community to minister to them? 
<bqverse 10>10 And he has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you. Do you now seek<a name="fnB691" href="num_note.htm#fn691"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> the priesthood also? 
<bqverse 11>11  Therefore you and all your company have assembled together against the LORD; and Aaron--what is he, that you murmur against him?"<a name="fnB692" href="num_note.htm#fn692"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 12>12  And Moses sent to summon<a name="fnB693" href="num_note.htm#fn693"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; but they said, "We will not come up.<a name="fnB694" href="num_note.htm#fn694"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  Is it a small thing<a name="fnB695" href="num_note.htm#fn695"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> that you have brought us up out of the land that flows with milk and honey,<a name="fnB696" href="num_note.htm#fn696"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> to kill us in the wilderness? Now do you want to make yourself a prince<a name="fnB697" href="num_note.htm#fn697"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> over us? 
<bqverse 14>14 Moreover,<a name="fnB698" href="num_note.htm#fn698"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> you have not brought us into a land that flows with milk and honey, nor given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Do you think you can blind<a name="fnB699" href="num_note.htm#fn699"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> these men? We will not come up."<p>

<bqverse 15>15  And Moses was very angry; and he said to the LORD, "Have no respect<a name="fnB700" href="num_note.htm#fn700"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> for their offering. I have not taken so much as one donkey from them, nor have I harmed any one of them." <p>

<bqverse 16>16  Then Moses said to Korah, "You and all your company be present before the LORD, you and they, and Aaron, tomorrow. 
<bqverse 17>17  And each of you<a name="fnB701" href="num_note.htm#fn701"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> take his censer, put<a name="fnB702" href="num_note.htm#fn702"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> incense in it, and then each of you present his censer before the LORD--two hundred fifty censers; along with you, and Aaron--each of you with his censer. 
<bqverse 18>18  So everyone took his censer, put fire in it, and set incense on it, and stood at the entrance of the tent of meeting, with Moses and Aaron. 
<bqverse 19>19  When<a name="fnB703" href="num_note.htm#fn703"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> Korah assembled the whole community against them at the entrance of the tent of meeting, then the glory of the LORD appeared to the whole community.<a name="_Toc494011564"></a></p>
<p><i>The Judgment on the Rebels</i>
<p>
<bqverse 20>20  And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron: 
<bqverse 21>21  Separate yourselves<a name="fnB704" href="num_note.htm#fn704"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> from among this community,<a name="fnB705" href="num_note.htm#fn705"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> that I may consume them in an instant. 
<bqverse 22>22  Then they fell down with their faces to the ground,<a name="fnB706" href="num_note.htm#fn706"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> and said, "O God, the God of the spirits of all people,<a name="fnB707" href="num_note.htm#fn707"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> will you be angry with the whole community when only one man sins?"<a name="fnB708" href="num_note.htm#fn708"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 23>23  So the LORD spoke to Moses: 
<bqverse 24>24  "Tell the community: `Get away<a name="fnB709" href="num_note.htm#fn709"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> from around the homes of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.'" 
<bqverse 25>25  Then Moses got up<a name="fnB710" href="num_note.htm#fn710"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel went after him. 
<bqverse 26>26 And he said to the community, "Move away from the tents of these wicked<a name="fnB711" href="num_note.htm#fn711"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> men, and do not touch anything they have, lest you be destroyed because<a name="fnB712" href="num_note.htm#fn712"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> of all their sins."<a name="fnB713" href="num_note.htm#fn713"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  So they got away from the homes of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stationed themselves<a name="fnB714" href="num_note.htm#fn714"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> in the entrances of their tents, with their wives and their children, and their toddlers. 
<bqverse 28>28 Then Moses said, "This is how<a name="fnB715" href="num_note.htm#fn715"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> you will know that the LORD has sent me to do all these works, for I have not done them of my own will.<a name="fnB716" href="num_note.htm#fn716"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 29>29 If these men die a natural death,<a name="fnB717" href="num_note.htm#fn717"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> or if they share the fate<a name="fnB718" href="num_note.htm#fn718"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> of all men, then the LORD has not sent me. 
<bqverse 30>30  But if the LORD does something entirely new,<a name="fnB719" href="num_note.htm#fn719"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them up<a name="fnB720" href="num_note.htm#fn720"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> with all that they have, and they<a name="fnB721" href="num_note.htm#fn721"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> go down alive to the grave,<a name="fnB722" href="num_note.htm#fn722"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> then you will know that these men have despised the LORD!"<p>

<bqverse 31>31  And when he had finished<a name="fnB723" href="num_note.htm#fn723"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> speaking<a name="fnB724" href="num_note.htm#fn724"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> all these words, the ground that was under them split open, 
<bqverse 32>32  and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, along with their houses, and all Korah's men, and all their goods. 
<bqverse 33>33  They and all that they had went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed over them. So they perished from the midst of the community. 
<bqverse 34>34  And all the Israelites<a name="fnB725" href="num_note.htm#fn725"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> that were around them fled at their cry, for they said, "What if<a name="fnB726" href="num_note.htm#fn726"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> the earth swallows us too?" 
<bqverse 35>35  Then a fire<a name="fnB727" href="num_note.htm#fn727"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> went out from the LORD and devoured the two hundred fifty men that offered incense.<a name="_Toc494011565"></a></p>
<p><i>The Atonement for the Rebellion</i>
<p>
<bqverse 36>36 <i>(17.1)</i><a name="fnB728" href="num_note.htm#fn728"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> And the LORD spoke to Moses: 
<bqverse 37>37  "Tell<a name="fnB729" href="num_note.htm#fn729"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to pick up<a name="fnB730" href="num_note.htm#fn730"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> the censers out of the flame, for they are holy, and then scatter the coals of fire<a name="fnB731" href="num_note.htm#fn731"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> at a distance. 
<bqverse 38>38 As for the censers of these who sinned at the cost of their lives,<a name="fnB732" href="num_note.htm#fn732"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> they must be made into<a name="fnB733" href="num_note.htm#fn733"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> into hammered sheets for covering the altar, for they presented them before the LORD and sanctified them; and they will become a sign to the Israelites." 
<bqverse 39>39  So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers presented by those who had been burned, and they were hammered out as a covering for the altar. 
<bqverse 40>40  It was a memorial for the Israelites, that no outsider who is not a descendant of Aaron come near to burn incense before the LORD, that he might not become like Korah and his company, just as the LORD had spoken by the authority of Moses.<p>

<bqverse 41>41  But on the next day the whole community of Israelites murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying, "You have killed the people of the LORD."<a name="fnB734" href="num_note.htm#fn734"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 42>42 When the community assembled<a name="fnB735" href="num_note.htm#fn735"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> against Moses and against Aaron, they turned toward the tent of meeting--and<a name="fnB736" href="num_note.htm#fn736"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared. 
<bqverse 43>43  And Moses and Aaron stood before the tent of meeting.<p>

<bqverse 44>44 And the LORD spoke to Moses: 
<bqverse 45>45  "Get away from this community, that I may consume them in an instant." 
<bqverse 46>46  And Moses said to Aaron, "Take the censer and put fire in it from the altar, and lay incense on it, and go quickly into the community and make an atonement for them, for wrath has gone out from the LORD--the plague has begun." 
<bqverse 47>47  So Aaron did<a name="fnB737" href="num_note.htm#fn737"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> as Moses had commanded, and ran into the middle of the assembly--now the plague was just beginning among the people. And he placed incense, and made atonement for the people. 
<bqverse 48>48  And he stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was stopped. 
<bqverse 49>49  Now those who died in the plague were 14,700, besides those who died over the matter of Korah. 
<bqverse 50>50  Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and the plague was stopped.

<bqverse 8>8  And the LORD spoke to Aaron, "See, I have given you the responsibility for my raised offerings; I have given all the holy things of the Israelites to you by reason of your anointing,<a name="fnB763" href="num_note.htm#fn763"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> and to your sons as a perpetual ordinance. 
<bqverse 9>9  Of all the most holy offerings reserved<a name="fnB764" href="num_note.htm#fn764"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> from the fire this will be yours: every offering of theirs, whether from every grain offering of theirs, or from every purification offering of theirs, or from every reparation offering of theirs which they bring to me, will be most holy for you and for your sons. 
<bqverse 10>10  You are to eat it in the most holy place; every male may eat it. It will be holy to you.<p>

<bqverse 11>11  And this is yours: the raised offering of their gift, along with all the waved offerings of the Israelites. I have given them to you and to your sons and daughters with you as a perpetual ordinance. Everyone who is clean in your household may eat of it.<p>

<bqverse 12>12  All the best of the olive oil, and all the best of the wine and of the wheat, the first fruits of these things that they give to the LORD, I have given to you.<a name="fnB765" href="num_note.htm#fn765"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  And whatever first ripe fruit in the land they bring to the LORD will be yours; everyone who is clean in your household may eat of it.<p>

<bqverse 14>14  Everything devoted<a name="fnB766" href="num_note.htm#fn766"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> in Israel will be yours. 
<bqverse 15>15  The firstborn of every womb which they present to the LORD, whether human beings or animals, will be yours. Nevertheless, the firstborn of people you must redeem,<a name="fnB767" href="num_note.htm#fn767"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> and the firstborn male of unclean animals you must redeem. 
<bqverse 16>16  And those that are to be redeemed, you are to redeem when they are a month old, according to your estimation, for five shekels of silver according to the sanctuary shekel, which is twenty gerahs. 
<bqverse 17>17  But you must not redeem the firstborn of a cow or a sheep or a goat; they are holy. You must sprinkle<a name="fnB768" href="num_note.htm#fn768"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> their blood on the altar and burn their fat for an offering made by fire for a pleasing aroma to the LORD. 
<bqverse 18>18  And their meat will be yours, just as the raised breast and the right hip is yours. 
<bqverse 19>19  All the raised offerings of the holy things that the Israelites offer to the LORD, I have given to you, and to your sons and daughters with you, as a perpetual ordinance. It is a covenant of salt<a name="fnB769" href="num_note.htm#fn769"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> forever before the LORD for you and for your descendants with you.<a name="_Toc494011570"></a></p>
<p><i>Duties of the Levites</i>
<p>
<bqverse 20>20  And the LORD spoke to Aaron, "You will have no inheritance in their land, nor will you have any portion among them--I am your portion and your inheritance among the Israelites. 
<bqverse 21>21  And see, I have given the Levites all the tithes in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they perform--the service of the tent of meeting. 
<bqverse 22>22 No longer may the Israelites approach the tent of meeting, lest they bear their sin<a name="fnB770" href="num_note.htm#fn770"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and die. 
<bqverse 23>23  But the Levites must perform the service<a name="fnB771" href="num_note.htm#fn771"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> of the tent of meeting, and they must bear their iniquity.<a name="fnB772" href="num_note.htm#fn772"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> It will be a perpetual ordinance throughout your generations that among the Israelites they have no inheritance.<a name="fnB773" href="num_note.htm#fn773"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  But I have given<a name="fnB774" href="num_note.htm#fn774"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> to the Levites for an inheritance the tithes of the Israelites that are offered<a name="fnB775" href="num_note.htm#fn775"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> to the LORD as a raised offering. That is why I said to them that among the Israelites they are to have no inheritance."<a name="_Toc494011571"></a></p>
<p><i>Instructions for the Levites</i>
<p>
<bqverse 25>25  And the LORD spoke to Moses: 
<bqverse 26>26  "You are to speak to the Levites, and you must tell them, `When you receive from the Israelites the tithe which I have given you from them as your inheritance, then you are to offer up<a name="fnB776" href="num_note.htm#fn776"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> from it as a raised offering to the LORD a tenth of the tithe. 
<bqverse 27>27  And your raised offering will be credited<a name="fnB777" href="num_note.htm#fn777"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> to you as though it were grain from the threshing floor or as juice<a name="fnB778" href="num_note.htm#fn778"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> from the winepress. 
<bqverse 28>28  Thus you are to offer up a raised offering to the LORD of all your tithes which you receive from the Israelites; and you must give the LORD's raised offering from it to Aaron the priest. 
<bqverse 29>29  From all your gifts you must offer up every raised offering due<a name="fnB779" href="num_note.htm#fn779"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> to the LORD, from all the best of it, and the holiest part of it.'<a name="fnB780" href="num_note.htm#fn780"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 30>30  "Therefore you will say to them,<a name="fnB781" href="num_note.htm#fn781"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> `When you offer up<a name="fnB782" href="num_note.htm#fn782"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> the best of it, then it will be credited to the Levites as the product of the threshing floor and as the product of the winepress. 
<bqverse 31>31  And you may<a name="fnB783" href="num_note.htm#fn783"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> eat it in any place, you and your household, because it is your wages for your service in the tent of meeting. 
<bqverse 32>32 And you will bear no sin concerning it when you offer up the best of it. And you must not profane the holy things of the Israelites, lest you die.'"<a name="fnB784" href="num_note.htm#fn784"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 5>5  And the heifer must be burnt<a name="fnB793" href="num_note.htm#fn793"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> in his sight--its skin, its flesh, its blood, and its offal is to be burnt.<a name="fnB794" href="num_note.htm#fn794"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 2>2  And there was no water for the community; and so they gathered themselves together against Moses and Aaron.

<p><i>Moses Responds</i>

<bqverse 6>6  So Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the entrance to the tent of meeting, and they fell down with their faces to the ground; and the glory of the LORD appeared to them. 
<bqverse 7>7  Then the LORD spoke to Moses: 
<bqverse 8>8 "Take the rod and assemble the community, you and Aaron your brother, and then speak<a name="fnB832" href="num_note.htm#fn832"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> to the rock before their eyes.

<bqverse 9>9  So Moses took the rod from before the LORD, just as he commanded him. 
<bqverse 10>10  Then Moses and Aaron gathered the community together in front of the rock, and he said to them, "Listen, you rebels,<a name="fnB834" href="num_note.htm#fn834"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> must we bring<a name="fnB835" href="num_note.htm#fn835"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> water out of this rock for you?" 
<bqverse 11>11  Then Moses raised his hand, and struck the rock twice with his rod. And water came out abundantly. So the community drank, and their beasts drank too.<a name="_Toc494011576"></a></p>
<p><i>The LORD's Judgment</i>

<bqverse 27>27  So Moses did as the LORD commanded; and they went up Mount Hor in the sight of the whole community. 
<bqverse 28>28  And Moses removed Aaron's garments and put them on his son Eleazar. So Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. And Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. 
<bqverse 29>29  When all the community saw that Aaron was dead, the whole house of Israel mourned for Aaron for thirty days.

<bqverse 2>2  So Israel made a vow<a name="fnB864" href="num_note.htm#fn864"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> to the LORD and said, "If you will indeed deliver<a name="fnB865" href="num_note.htm#fn865"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> this people into our hand, then we will utterly destroy<a name="fnB866" href="num_note.htm#fn866"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> their cities." 
<bqverse 3>3  Then the LORD listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites, and they utterly destroyed them and their cities.

<bqverse 5>5 And the people spoke against God and against Moses, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness, for there is no bread or water, and we detest this worthless<a name="fnB870" href="num_note.htm#fn870"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> bread."<p>

<bqverse 6>6  So the LORD sent poisonous<a name="fnB871" href="num_note.htm#fn871"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> snakes<a name="fnB872" href="num_note.htm#fn872"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> among the people, and they bit the people; many people of Israel died. 
<bqverse 7>7  Then the people came to Moses and said, "We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD and against you.

<p>
<bqverse 21>21 <a name="fnB887" href="num_note.htm#fn887"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> Then Israel sent messengers to King Sihon of the Amorites, saying, <p>

<bqverse 23>23  But Sihon did not permit Israel to pass through his border; he<a name="fnB889" href="num_note.htm#fn889"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> gathered all his forces<a name="fnB890" href="num_note.htm#fn890"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> together and went out against Israel into the wilderness. When<a name="fnB891" href="num_note.htm#fn891"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> he came to Jahaz, he fought against Israel. 
<bqverse 24>24  But the Israelites<a name="fnB892" href="num_note.htm#fn892"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> defeated him with the edge of the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the Ammonites, for the border of the Ammonites was strong. 
<bqverse 25>25  So Israel took all these cities; and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages.<a name="fnB893" href="num_note.htm#fn893"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  For Heshbon was the city of King Sihon of the Amorites. Now he had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken all of his land out of his control,<a name="fnB894" href="num_note.htm#fn894"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> as far as the Arnon.

<bqverse 33>33  Then they turned and went up by the road to Bashan. And King Og of Bashan and all his forces<a name="fnB902" href="num_note.htm#fn902"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> went out against them to the battle at Edrei. 
<bqverse 34>34  And the LORD said to Moses, "Do not fear him, for I have delivered him and all his people and his land into your hand. You will do to him what you did to King Sihon of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon. 
<bqverse 35>35  So they defeated Og,<a name="fnB903" href="num_note.htm#fn903"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> his sons, and all his people, until there were no survivors,<a name="fnB904" href="num_note.htm#fn904"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> and they possessed his land.

<bqverse 2>2  Balak son of Zippor saw all that the Israelites had done to the Amorites. 
<bqverse 3>3 And the Moabites were greatly afraid of the people, because they were so numerous. The Moabites<a name="fnB908" href="num_note.htm#fn908"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> were sick with fear because of the Israelites.<p>

<bqverse 4>4  So the Moabites said to the elders of Midian, "Now this mass of people<a name="fnB909" href="num_note.htm#fn909"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> will lick up everything around us, as the bull devours the grass of the field. Now Balak son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at this time. 
<bqverse 5>5  And he sent messengers to Balaam<a name="fnB910" href="num_note.htm#fn910"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> son of Beor at Pethor, which is by the river in his native land,<a name="fnB911" href="num_note.htm#fn911"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> to summon him, saying, "Look, a nation has come out of Egypt. They cover the face<a name="fnB912" href="num_note.htm#fn912"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> of the earth, and they are settling next to me. 
<bqverse 6>6  So<a name="fnB913" href="num_note.htm#fn913"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> now, please come and curse this nation for me, for they are too powerful for me. Perhaps I will prevail so that we may conquer them,<a name="fnB914" href="num_note.htm#fn914"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and drive them out of the land. For I know that whoever you bless is blessed,<a name="fnB915" href="num_note.htm#fn915"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> and whoever you curse is cursed."<p>

<bqverse 7>7 So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the fee for divination in their hand. And they came to Balaam and reported to him the words of Balak. 
<bqverse 8>8  He replied to them, "Stay<a name="fnB916" href="num_note.htm#fn916"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> here tonight, and I will bring back to you whatever word the LORD may speak to me." So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam. 
<bqverse 9>9  And God came to Balaam and said, "Who are these men with you?" 
<bqverse 10>10  Balaam said to God, "Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent a message to me saying,

<bqverse 13>13  So Balaam got up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, "Go to your land, for the LORD has refused to permit me to go<a name="fnB922" href="num_note.htm#fn922"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> with you."

<p><i>Balaam Accompanies the Moabite Princes</i>

<bqverse 15>15  And Balak again sent princes,<a name="fnB924" href="num_note.htm#fn924"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> more numerous and more honorable than the first.<a name="fnB925" href="num_note.htm#fn925"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  And they came to Balaam and said to him, "Thus says Balak son of Zippor: `Please do not let anything hinder you from coming<a name="fnB926" href="num_note.htm#fn926"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> to me.

<bqverse 18>18  Balaam replied<a name="fnB928" href="num_note.htm#fn928"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> to the servants of Balak, "If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not transgress the commandment of the LORD my God<a name="fnB929" href="num_note.htm#fn929"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> to do less or more.

<bqverse 20>20 And God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, "If the men come to call you, get up and go with them; but the word that I will say to you, that you must do." 
<bqverse 21>21  So Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab. <a name="_Toc494011585"></a></p>
<p><i>God Opposes Balaam</i>

<bqverse 22>22 Then God's anger was kindled<a name="fnB932" href="num_note.htm#fn932"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> because he went, and the angel of the LORD stood in the road to oppose<a name="fnB933" href="num_note.htm#fn933"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> him. Now he was riding on his donkey and his two servants were with him. 
<bqverse 23>23  And the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with<a name="fnB934" href="num_note.htm#fn934"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> his sword drawn in his hand, so the donkey turned aside from the road and went into the field. And Balaam beat the donkey, to make her turn back to the road. <p>

<bqverse 24>24 Then the angel of the LORD stood in a path<a name="fnB935" href="num_note.htm#fn935"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> among the vineyards, where there was a wall on either side.<a name="fnB936" href="num_note.htm#fn936"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  And when the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she pressed herself into the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall, and so he beat her again.<a name="fnB937" href="num_note.htm#fn937"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 26>26  Then the angel of the LORD went farther, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left. 
<bqverse 27>27  So when the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she crouched down under Balaam. Then Balaam's anger was kindled, and he beat his donkey with a staff. <p>

<bqverse 28>28  Then the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, "What have I done to you that you have beaten me these three times?" 
<bqverse 29>29  And Balaam said to the donkey, "Because you have made me look stupid; I wish<a name="fnB938" href="num_note.htm#fn938"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> there were a sword in my hand, for now I would kill you." 
<bqverse 30>30  And the donkey said to Balaam, "Am not I your donkey that you have ridden ever since I was yours until this day?

<bqverse 31>31 Then the LORD opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way with his sword drawn in his hand; so he bowed his head, and fell down with his face to the ground.<a name="fnB941" href="num_note.htm#fn941"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 32>32 And the angel of the LORD said to him, "Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? Look, I came out to oppose you, because what you are doing<a name="fnB942" href="num_note.htm#fn942"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> is perverse before me.<a name="fnB943" href="num_note.htm#fn943"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 33>33 The donkey saw me, and turned from me these three times. If<a name="fnB944" href="num_note.htm#fn944"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> she had not turned from me, I would have killed you, but saved her alive." 
<bqverse 34>34 And Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, "I have sinned, for I did not know that you stood against me in the road.<a name="fnB945" href="num_note.htm#fn945"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> So now, if it is evil in your sight,<a name="fnB946" href="num_note.htm#fn946"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> I will go back home."<a name="fnB947" href="num_note.htm#fn947"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 4>4  And the LORD said to Moses, "Arrest all the leaders<a name="fnB1055" href="num_note.htm#fn1055"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> of the people, and hang them up<a name="fnB1056" href="num_note.htm#fn1056"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> before the LORD in broad daylight,<a name="fnB1057" href="num_note.htm#fn1057"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> so that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel." 
<bqverse 5>5 So Moses said to the judges of Israelites, "Each of you must execute those of his men<a name="fnB1058" href="num_note.htm#fn1058"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> who were joined to Baal-peor.<p>

<bqverse 6>6  Just then<a name="fnB1059" href="num_note.htm#fn1059"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> one of the Israelites came and brought to his brothers<a name="fnB1060" href="num_note.htm#fn1060"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> a Midianite woman, before the eyes of Moses and in the plain view<a name="fnB1061" href="num_note.htm#fn1061"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> of the whole community of the Israelites, while they<a name="fnB1062" href="num_note.htm#fn1062"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> were weeping at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 
<bqverse 7>7  When Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it,<a name="fnB1063" href="num_note.htm#fn1063"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> he got up from among the assembly, took a javelin in his hand,

<p><i>The Aftermath</i>
<p>
<bqverse 10>10  And the LORD spoke to Moses: 
<bqverse 11>11 "Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my anger away from the Israelites, when he was zealous with my zeal<a name="fnB1067" href="num_note.htm#fn1067"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> for my sake among them, so that I did not consume the Israelites in my zeal.<a name="fnB1068" href="num_note.htm#fn1068"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  Therefore, announce:<a name="fnB1069" href="num_note.htm#fn1069"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> `I am going to give<a name="fnB1070" href="num_note.htm#fn1070"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> to him my covenant of peace;<a name="fnB1071" href="num_note.htm#fn1071"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13 and so it will be to him and his descendants after him a covenant of a permanent priesthood, because he has been zealous for his God,<a name="fnB1072" href="num_note.htm#fn1072"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> and has made atonement<a name="fnB1073" href="num_note.htm#fn1073"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> for the Israelites.'"<p>

<bqverse 14>14 Now the name of the Israelite who was stabbed--the one who was stabbed with the Midianite woman--was Zimri son of Salu, a leader of a clan of the Simeonites. 
<bqverse 15>15  And the name of the Midianite woman that was killed was Cozbi daughter of Zur.

<bqverse 16>16  Then the LORD spoke to Moses: 
<bqverse 17>17  "Bring trouble<a name="fnB1076" href="num_note.htm#fn1076"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> to the Midianites, and destroy them,

<bqverse 22>22  So Moses did as the LORD commanded him; he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest and before the whole community.

<bqverse 7>7  And they fought against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses, and they killed every male.<a name="fnB1201" href="num_note.htm#fn1201"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  And they killed the kings of Midian in addition to those slain--Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba--five Midianite kings.<a name="fnB1202" href="num_note.htm#fn1202"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> And they killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.<a name="fnB1203" href="num_note.htm#fn1203"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 9>9  And the Israelites took the women of Midian captives along with their little ones, and took all their herds, all their flocks, and all their goods as plunder. 
<bqverse 10>10  And they burned<a name="fnB1204" href="num_note.htm#fn1204"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> all their towns<a name="fnB1205" href="num_note.htm#fn1205"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> that they had inhabited and all their encampments. 
<bqverse 11>11  And they took all the plunder and all the spoils, both people and animals. 
<bqverse 12>12  And they brought the captives and the spoils and the plunder to Moses and to Eleazar the priest, and to the Israelite community, to the camp on the steppes of Moab, along the Jordan River<a name="fnB1206" href="num_note.htm#fn1206"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> across from Jericho.<a name="fnB1207" href="num_note.htm#fn1207"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went out to meet them outside the camp.<a name="_Toc494011627"></a></p>
<p><i>The Death of the Midianite Women</i>
<p>
<bqverse 14>14 But Moses was furious with the officers of the army, the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds, who had come from service in the war. 
<bqverse 15>15  And Moses said to them, "Have you allowed all the women to live?<a name="fnB1208" href="num_note.htm#fn1208"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 16>16 Look, these people, through the counsel of Balaam, caused the Israelites to act treacherously against the LORD in the matter of Peor--and there was the plague among the community of the LORD. 
<bqverse 17>17  Now therefore kill every boy,<a name="fnB1209" href="num_note.htm#fn1209"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and kill every woman who has had sexual intercourse with a man.<a name="fnB1210" href="num_note.htm#fn1210"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Purification After Battle</i>
<p>
<bqverse 19>19  "And any of you who has killed anyone, or touched any of the dead, remain outside the camp for seven days; purify yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day. 
<bqverse 20>20  And you must purify each garment and everything that is made of skin, everything made of goat's hair, and everything made of wood."<a name="fnB1214" href="num_note.htm#fn1214"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 21>21 Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had gone into the battle, "This is the ordinance of the law that the LORD commanded Moses: 
<bqverse 22>22  `Only the gold, the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead, 
<bqverse 23>23 everything that may stand the fire, you are to pass through the fire,<a name="fnB1215" href="num_note.htm#fn1215"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> and it will be clean; but then it must be purified with the waters of impurity. Anything that cannot withstand the fire you must pass through the water. 
<bqverse 24>24 And you must wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you will be clean, and afterward you may come into the camp."<a name="_Toc494011629"></a></p>
<p><i>The Distribution of Spoils</i>
<p>
<bqverse 25>25  Then the LORD spoke to Moses: 
<bqverse 26>26  "You and Eleazar the priest, and all the family heads of the community, take the sum<a name="fnB1216" href="num_note.htm#fn1216"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> of the plunder that was captured, both people and animals. 
<bqverse 27>27  Divide the plunder into two parts, one for those who took part in the war, who went out to battle, and the other for all the community.<p>

<bqverse 28>28  "And you must exact<a name="fnB1217" href="num_note.htm#fn1217"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> a tribute for the LORD from the men of war who went out to battle: one life out of five hundred, from the people, the cattle, and from the donkeys and the sheep. 
<bqverse 29>29  You are to take it from their half-share, and give it to Eleazar the priest for a raised offering to the LORD. 
<bqverse 30>30  And from the Israelites' half-share you are to take one portion out of fifty of the people, the cattle, the donkeys, and the sheep--from every kind of animal, and you are to give them to the Levites, who are responsible for the care of the tabernacle of the LORD."<p>

<bqverse 31>31 So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<bqverse 32>32 And the spoil that remained of the plunder which the men of war had gathered<a name="fnB1218" href="num_note.htm#fn1218"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> was 675,000 sheep, 
<bqverse 33>33  72,000 cattle, 
<bqverse 34>34 61,000 donkeys, 
<bqverse 35>35  and 32,000 women who had never had sexual intercourse with a man.<a name="fnB1219" href="num_note.htm#fn1219"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 36>36 And the half-portion of those who went to war numbered 337,500 sheep; 
<bqverse 37>37 the LORD's tribute from the sheep was 675. 
<bqverse 38>38  And the cattle numbered<a name="fnB1220" href="num_note.htm#fn1220"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> 36,000; the LORD's tribute was 72. 
<bqverse 39>39  And the donkeys were 30,500, of which the LORD's tribute was 61. 
<bqverse 40>40 And the people were 16,000, of which the LORD's tribute was 32 people.<p>

<bqverse 41>41 So Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD's raised offering, to Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses. <p>

<bqverse 42>42 And from the Israelites' half-share that Moses had separated from the warriors, 
<bqverse 43>43 there were 337,500 sheep from the portion belonging to the community, 
<bqverse 44>44  and 36,000 cattle, 
<bqverse 45>45  and 30,500 donkeys, 
<bqverse 46>46  and 16,000 people.<p>

<bqverse 47>47  From the Israelites' share Moses took one of every fifty people and animals and gave them to the Levites who were responsible for the care of the tabernacle, as the LORD commanded Moses.<p>

<bqverse 48>48 Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, approached Moses 
<bqverse 49>49  and said to him,<a name="fnB1221" href="num_note.htm#fn1221"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> "Your servants have taken a count<a name="fnB1222" href="num_note.htm#fn1222"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> of the men who were in the battle, who were under our authority,<a name="fnB1223" href="num_note.htm#fn1223"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> and not one is missing. 
<bqverse 50>50  So we have brought for an offering for the LORD what each man found--gold ornaments, armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and necklaces, to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD."<a name="fnB1224" href="num_note.htm#fn1224"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 51>51  And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all of it fashioned into ornaments. 
<bqverse 52>52  And all the gold of the offering they had offered up to the LORD from the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds weighed 16,750 shekels.<a name="fnB1225" href="num_note.htm#fn1225"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 53>53  Each soldier had taken plunder for himself. 
<bqverse 54>54  So Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting as a memorial<a name="fnB1226" href="num_note.htm#fn1226"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> for the Israelites before the LORD.

<bqverse 1>1 </b><a name="fnB1227" href="num_note.htm#fn1227"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> Now the Reubenites and the Gadites possessed a very large amount of cattle, and when they saw that the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead was ideal for cattle,<a name="fnB1228" href="num_note.htm#fn1228"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  the Gadites and the Reubenites came and addressed Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the community. They said, 
<bqverse 3>3 "Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon, 
<bqverse 4>4  the land that the LORD subdued<a name="fnB1229" href="num_note.htm#fn1229"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> before the community of Israel, is ideal for cattle, and your servants have cattle." 
<bqverse 5>5  So they said, "If we have found favor in your sight, let this territory be given to your servants for our inheritance. Do not have us cross<a name="fnB1230" href="num_note.htm#fn1230"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> the Jordan River."<a name="fnB1231" href="num_note.htm#fn1231"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494011631"></a></p>
<p><i>Moses' Response</i>
<p>
<bqverse 6>6  And Moses said to the Gadites and the Reubenites, "Must your brothers go to war while you<a name="fnB1232" href="num_note.htm#fn1232"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> remain here? 
<bqverse 7>7  And why do you frustrate the intent<a name="fnB1233" href="num_note.htm#fn1233"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> of the Israelites to cross over into the land which the LORD has given them? 
<bqverse 8>8  Your fathers did the same thing when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land. 
<bqverse 9>9  When<a name="fnB1234" href="num_note.htm#fn1234"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> they went up to the Eshcol Valley and saw the land, they frustrated the intent of the Israelites so that they did not enter<a name="fnB1235" href="num_note.htm#fn1235"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> the land that the LORD had given<a name="fnB1236" href="num_note.htm#fn1236"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> them. 
<bqverse 10>10  And so the anger of the LORD was kindled that day, and he swore, 
<bqverse 11>11  `Not<a name="fnB1237" href="num_note.htm#fn1237"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> one of the men twenty years old and upward who came from Egypt will see the land that I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because they have not followed me wholeheartedly,<a name="fnB1238" href="num_note.htm#fn1238"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua son of Nun, for they followed the LORD wholeheartedly.' 
<bqverse 13>13  So the LORD's anger was kindled against the Israelites, and he made them wander in the wilderness for forty years, until all that generation that had done wickedly before the LORD was finished.<a name="fnB1239" href="num_note.htm#fn1239"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  Now look, you are standing in your fathers' place, a brood of sinners, to increase still further the fierce wrath of the LORD against the Israelites. 
<bqverse 15>15  For if you turn away from following him, he will once again abandon<a name="fnB1240" href="num_note.htm#fn1240"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> them in the wilderness, and you will be the reason for the destruction."<a name="_Toc494011632"></a></p>
<p><i>The Offer of the Reubenites and Gadites</i>
<p>
<bqverse 16>16  Then they came very close to him and said, "We will build sheep folds here for our flocks, and cities for our families,<a name="fnB1241" href="num_note.htm#fn1241"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  but we will maintain ourselves in armed readiness<a name="fnB1242" href="num_note.htm#fn1242"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> and go before the Israelites until whenever we have brought them to their place. And our descendants will be living in fortified towns as a protection against<a name="fnB1243" href="num_note.htm#fn1243"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> the inhabitants of the land. 
<bqverse 18>18  We will not return to our homes until every Israelite has his inheritance. 
<bqverse 19>19  For we will not accept any inheritance on the other side of the Jordan River<a name="fnB1244" href="num_note.htm#fn1244"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and beyond, because our inheritance has come to us on this eastern side of the Jordan."<p>

<bqverse 20>20  Then Moses replied, "If you will do this thing, and if you will arm yourselves for battle before the LORD, 
<bqverse 21>21  and if all your armed men cross the Jordan before the LORD until he drives out his enemies from his presence 
<bqverse 22>22  and the land is subdued before the LORD, then afterward you may return and be free of your obligation to the LORD and to Israel. This land will then be your possession in the LORD's sight.<p>

<bqverse 23>23  "But if you do not do all this, then look, you will have sinned<a name="fnB1245" href="num_note.htm#fn1245"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> against the LORD. And know that your sin will find you. 
<bqverse 24>24 So build cities for your descendants and pens for your sheep, but do what you have said<a name="fnB1246" href="num_note.htm#fn1246"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> you would."<p>

<bqverse 25>25  So the Gadites and the Reubenites replied to Moses, "Your servants will do as my lord commands. 
<bqverse 26>26  Our children, our wives, our flocks, and our livestock will be there in the cities of Gilead, 
<bqverse 27>27  but your servants will cross over, every man armed for war, to do battle in the LORD's presence, just as my lord says."<p>

<bqverse 28>28  So Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua son of Nun, and to the heads of the families of the Israelite tribes. 
<bqverse 29>29  Moses said to them: "If the Gadites and the Reubenites cross the Jordan with you, each one equipped for battle in the LORD's presence, and you conquer the land, then you must allot them the territory of Gilead as their possession. 
<bqverse 30>30  But if they do not cross over with you armed, they must receive possessions among you in Canaan." 
<bqverse 31>31 Then the Gadites and the Reubenites answered, "Your servants will do what the LORD has spoken. 
<bqverse 32>32  We will cross armed in the LORD's presence into Canaan, and then the possession of our inheritance that we inherit will be ours on this side of the Jordan River."<a name="fnB1247" href="num_note.htm#fn1247"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494011633"></a></p>
<p><i>Land Assignment</i>
<p>
<bqverse 33>33  So Moses gave to the Gadites, the Reubenites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, son of Joseph, the realm of King Sihon of the Amorites, and the realm of King Og of Bashan, the entire land with its cities and the territory surrounding them. 
<bqverse 34>34 And the Gadites rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, 
<bqverse 35>35  Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, 
<bqverse 36>36  Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran as fortified cities, and constructed pens for their flocks. 
<bqverse 37>37  And the Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, 
<bqverse 38>38  Nebo, Baal-meon (with a change of name) and Sibmah. And they renamed<a name="fnB1248" href="num_note.htm#fn1248"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> the cities they built.<p>

<bqverse 39>39  And the descendants of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it. 
<bqverse 40>40  So Moses gave Gilead to Machir, son of Manasseh, and he lived there. 
<bqverse 41>41 Now Jair son of Manasseh went and captured their small towns and named them Havvoth Jair. 
<bqverse 42>42  Then Nobah went and captured Kenath and its villages and called it Nobah after his own name.

<p><i>At the Border of Canaan</i>
<p>
<bqverse 50>50  And the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho. He said: 
<bqverse 51>51  "Speak to the Israelites and tell them, `When you have crossed the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 
<bqverse 52>52  you must drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you. Destroy all their carved images, all their molten images, and demolish their high places. 
<bqverse 53>53  You must dispossess the inhabitants of the land and live in it, for I have given you the land to possess it. 
<bqverse 54>54  And you must divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families. To a larger group you must give a larger inheritance, and to a smaller group you must give a smaller inheritance. Everyone's inheritance must be in the place where his lot falls. And you must inherit according to your ancestral tribes. 
<bqverse 55>55  But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land before you, then those whom you let remain will be irritants in your eyes, and thorns in your side, and will trouble you in the land where you will be living. 
<bqverse 56>56 And what I intended to do to them I will do to you."

<p><i>The Levitical Cities</i>
<p><A NAME="35"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b><a name="fnB1268" href="num_note.htm#fn1268"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the Moabite plains by the Jordan near Jericho. He said: 
<bqverse 2>2 "Instruct the Israelites to give<a name="fnB1269" href="num_note.htm#fn1269"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> the Levites towns to live in, from the inheritance that they will possess. You must also give the Levites grazing land around the towns. 
<bqverse 3>3  Thus they will have towns in which to live, and their grazing lands will be for their cattle, for their possessions, and for all their animals. 
<bqverse 4>4 And the grazing lands around the towns that you will give to the Levites must extend to a distance of five hundred yards<a name="fnB1270" href="num_note.htm#fn1270"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> from the town wall.<p>

<bqverse 5>5  "And you must measure<a name="fnB1271" href="num_note.htm#fn1271"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> from outside the wall of the town on the east one thousand yards,<a name="fnB1272" href="num_note.htm#fn1272"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and on the south side one thousand yards, and on the west side one thousand yards, and on the north side one thousand yards, with the town in the middle. This territory must belong to them as grazing land for the towns. 
<bqverse 6>6 Now out of these towns that you will give to the Levites you must select six towns of refuge to which a person who has killed someone may flee.<a name="fnB1273" href="num_note.htm#fn1273"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> And you must give them forty-two other towns.<p>

<bqverse 7>7 "So the total of the towns you will give the Levites is forty-eight. You must give these together with their grazing lands. 
<bqverse 8>8  And the towns you will give must be from the possession of the Israelites. From the larger tribes you must give more; and from the smaller tribes fewer. Each must contribute some of its own towns to the Levites in proportion to the inheritance allocated to each.<a name="_Toc494011644"></a></p>
<p><i>The Cities of Refuge</i>
<p>
<bqverse 9>9  Then the LORD spoke to Moses: 
<bqverse 10>10 "Speak to the Israelites and tell them, `When you cross over the Jordan River<a name="fnB1274" href="num_note.htm#fn1274"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> into the land of Canaan, 
<bqverse 11>11  you must then designate some towns as towns of refuge for you, to which a person who has killed someone unintentionally may flee. 
<bqverse 12>12  And they must stand as your towns of refuge from the avenger in order that the killer may not die until he has stood trial before the community. 
<bqverse 13>13  These six towns that you must give you will have for refuge.<p>

<bqverse 14>14  "You must give three towns on this side of the Jordan and you must give three towns in the land of Canaan; they must be towns of refuge
<bqverse 15>15  These six towns will be places of refuge for the Israelites, and for the foreigner, and for the settler among them, that anyone one who kills any person accidentally may flee there. <p>

<bqverse 16>16  "But if he hits someone with an iron tool so that he dies,<a name="fnB1275" href="num_note.htm#fn1275"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> he is a murderer. The murderer must surely be put to death. 
<bqverse 17>17  And if he strikes him by throwing a stone large enough that he could die, and he dies, he is a murderer. The murderer must surely be put to death.  
<bqverse 18>18  Or if he strikes him with a hand weapon of wood so that he could die, and he dies, he is a murderer. The murderer must surely be put to death. 
<bqverse 19>19  The avenger<a name="fnB1276" href="num_note.htm#fn1276"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> of blood himself must kill the murderer; when he meets him he must kill him.<p>

<bqverse 20>20  "But if he strikes him out of hatred, or throws something at him intentionally,<a name="fnB1277" href="num_note.htm#fn1277"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> so that he dies-- 
<bqverse 21>21  or in strife he strikes him with his hand, and he dies, the one who struck him must surely be put to death; for he is a murderer. The avenger of blood must kill the murderer when he meets him.<p>

<bqverse 22>22  "But if he strikes him suddenly, without strife, or throws anything at him unintentionally, 
<bqverse 23>23 or with any stone large enough that a man could die, without seeing him, and throws it at him, and he dies, even though he was not his enemy nor sought his harm, 
<bqverse 24>24 then the community must judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these decisions. 
<bqverse 25>25  And the community must deliver the slayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the community must restore him to the town of refuge to which he fled, and he must live there until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the consecrated oil. 
<bqverse 26>26  But if the slayer at any time goes outside the boundary of the town to which he had fled, 
<bqverse 27>27  and the avenger of blood find him outside the borders of the town of refuge, and the avenger of blood kills the slayer, he will not be guilty of blood, 
<bqverse 28>28  because the slayer should have stayed in his town of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest, the slayer may return to the land of his possessions. 
<bqverse 29>29  So these things must be a statute of judgment for you throughout your generations, in all the places where you live.<p>

<bqverse 30>30  "Whoever kills any person, the murderer must be put to death by the word<a name="fnB1278" href="num_note.htm#fn1278"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> of witnesses; but one witness cannot<a name="fnB1279" href="num_note.htm#fn1279"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> testify against any person to cause him to be put to death. 
<bqverse 31>31  Moreover, you must not accept a ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death; he must surely be put to death. 
<bqverse 32>32  And you must not accept a ransom for anyone who has fled to a town of refuge, to allow him to return home and live on his own land before the death of the high priest.<p>

<bqverse 33>33  "You must not pollute the land where you live, for blood defiles the land, and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed there, except by the blood of the person who shed it. 
<bqverse 34>34  Therefore do not defile the land that you will inhabit, in which I live, for I the LORD live among the Israelites.
