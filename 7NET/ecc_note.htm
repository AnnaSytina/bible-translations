 <b>tn</b> (1:1)  The meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tl#h#q)</FONT> is somewhat puzzling. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lhq</FONT> means "to assemble, summon" (<i>HALOT</i> 1078-79), and is derived from the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lhq</FONT> "assembly" (<i>HALOT</i> 1079-80). Thus <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tl#h#q)</FONT> might mean: (1) convener of the assembly, (2) leader, speaker, teacher, or preacher of the assembly, or (3) member of the assembly. Elsewhere in the book, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tl#h#q)</FONT> is used in collocation with statements about his position as king in Jerusalem (Eccl 1:12), his proclamations about life (Eccl 1:2; 7:27; 12:8), and his teaching of wisdom and writing wise sayings (Eccl 12:9-10). Thus, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tl#h#q)</FONT> probably means "the leader of the assembly" or "speaker of the assembly" (<i>HALOT</i> 1080). (See also the following study note.) Rabbinic literature treats <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tl#h#q)</FONT> as a traditional surname for Solomon, that is, "Qoheleth," relating it to the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lhq</FONT> ("assembly").  For example, this explanation is found in rabbinic literature (Qoheleth Rabbah 1:1): "Why was his name called Qoheleth [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tlhq</FONT>]? Because his words were proclaimed in public meeting [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lhq</FONT>], as it is written (1 Kings 8:1)." The LXX rendered it <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejkklhsiasth"</FONT> ("member of the assembly," LSJ 509), as was the custom of relating Greek <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejkklhsiva</FONT> ("assembly") to Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lhq</FONT> ("assembly," <i>HALOT</i> 1079). The book's English title, "Ecclesiastes," is simply a transliteration of the Greek term from the LXX. Symmachus's <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">paroimiasth"</FONT> ("author of proverbs," LSJ 1342) is not a translation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tl#h#q)</FONT> but refers to his authorship of many proverbs (Eccl. 12:9-10). In terms of the participial form, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tl#h#q)</FONT> is used substantively to designate the profession or title of the author. The term is used in 12:8 with the article, indicating that it is a professional title rather than a personal surname: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tl#h#oQh^</FONT> ("the Teacher"). Substantival participles often designate the title or profession of an individual: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/h@K)</FONT> "priest," <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/z}r)</FONT> "ruler," <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rf@v)</FONT> "officer," <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dq@n{</FONT> "sheep-breeder," <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">fp@v)</FONT> "judge," <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rx@y{</FONT> "potter," <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;r}K)</FONT> "vine-dresser," <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bg}y{</FONT> "farmer," <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ru@ov</FONT> "gate-keeper," <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[r}ox</FONT> "smelter," and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ap@r)</FONT> "doctor" (<i>IBHS</i>, 614-15). In terms of its feminine ending with a male referent, Jo&uuml;on suggests that it is intensive, e.g., <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tu^d^om</FONT> "close relative" from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ud*om</FONT> "kinsman" (Jo&uuml;on-Muraoka, <i>Grammar</i>, &#167;89.b). The feminine ending is used similarly in Arabic in reference to a male referent, e.g., Arabic <i>rawiyat</i> "a great narrator" from <i>rawi</i> "narrator" (Wright, <i>Arabic Grammar</i>, 1:233c). So <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tl#h#q)</FONT> may mean "the leader/teacher of the assembly" from the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lhq</FONT> ("assembly"). When used in reference to a male referent, feminine forms denote a professional title or vocational office (as in Arabic, Ethiopic, and Aramaic), e.g., <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tr\p#s)</FONT> "scribe," <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tr\k#P)</FONT> "gazelle-catcher," <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hj*P#</FONT> "provincial governor," and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tour&#180;P=</FONT> "princes" (GKC &#167;122.<i>r</i>). Occasionally, a professional name later became a personal name, e.g., the title <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tr\p#s)</FONT> ("scribe") became the name "Sophereth" (Ezra 2:55; Neh 7:57), <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tr#k#P)</FONT> ("gazelle-catcher") became "Pokereth" (Ezra 2:57; Neh 7:59), and perhaps <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tl#h#q)</FONT> ("assembler") became the surname "Qoheleth" (<i>HALOT </i>926). Many translations render <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tl#h#q)</FONT> as a professional title: "the Speaker" (NEB, Moffatt), "the Preacher" (KJV, RSV, YLT, MLB, ASV, NASB), "the Teacher" (NIV, NRSV), "the Leader of the Assembly" (NIV margin), "the Assembler" (NJPS margin). Others render it as a personal surname: "Koheleth" (AB, JPS, NJPS) and "Qoheleth" (NAB, NRSV margin).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:1)  The Hebrew verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lh^q*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">q*h*l</FONT>) means "to assemble; to summon" (<i>HALOT </i>1078-79). It is used of assembling or summoning various groups of people: "all Israel" (1 Chr 13:5; 15:3), "the elders of Israel" (1 Kgs 8:1; 2 Chr 5:2), all the elders of their tribes" (Deut 31:28), "all the princes of Israel" (1 Chr 28:1), "your tribes" (Deut 31:28), "all the house of Judah" (1 Kgs 12:21; 2 Chr 11:1), "the people" (Deut 4:10; 31:12), "the whole congregation" (Lev 8:3; Num 1:18; 16:19; 20:8), "all the congregation of the sons of Israel" (Exod 35:1; Num 8:9), "the assembly" (Num 10:7; 20:10), and "your assembly" (Ezek 38:13). The verb is often used in reference to summoning/assembling people for a religious occasion (Exod 35:1; Lev 8:3-4; Num 8:9; Deut 4:10; Josh 18:1; 22:12; 1 Kgs 8:1; 2 Chr 5:2-3), a political occasion (2 Sam 20:14), a military occasion (Judg 20:11; 2 Chr 11:1), or a judicial occasion (Job 11:10). The Hiphil stem is used to describe the action of the leader (usually a single individual who possesses/commands authority) summoning the people, e.g., Moses (Exod 35:1; Lev 8:3; Num 20:10), Moses and Aaron (Num 1:18), Korah (Num 16:19), King David (1 Chr 13:5; 15:3; 28:1), King Solomon (1 Kgs 8:1; 12:21; 2 Chr 5:2), and King Rehoboam (2 Chr 11:1). In almost every case, he who assembles the people is a person invested with authority; he makes a public proclamation or leads the nation in an important action. The Niphal stem is most often used to describe the people assembling at the direction of the leader (e.g., Lev 8:4; Josh 18:1; 22:12; 1 Kgs 8:2; 2 Chr 5:3). The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lh^q*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">q*h*l</FONT>) is a denominative derived from the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lh*q*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">q*h*l</FONT>, "assembly; contingent"; <i>HALOT </i>1079-80). The noun has numerous referents: the congregated nation as a whole in the wilderness, assembled for ceremonies and instruction (Exod 16:3; Lev 4:13, 21; 16:17, 33; Num 10:7; 14:5; 15:15; 16:3; 17:12; 19:20; 20:4, 6, 10, 12; Deut 9:10; 10:4; 18:16); the congregation of Israel assembled for divine worship (Pss 22:23, 26; 26:5; 35:18; 40:10; 107:32; 149:1; Lam 1:10); the post-exilic community assembled to hear the Torah and instruction (Neh 13:1); a military contingent assembled for warfare (Num 16:3; 20:4; Judg 20:2; 21:5, 8; 1 Sam 17:47; 2 Chr 28:14); people summoned to court (Ezek 16:40; 23:46-47); judicial authorities (Jer 26:17; Prov 5:14; 26:26; Sir 7:7). The term is often used as a designation for Israel: "the assembly of Israel" (Lev 16:17; Deut 31:30; Josh 8:35; 1 Kgs 8:14, 22, 55; 12:3; 2 Chr 6:3, 12-13; Sir 50:13, 20), "the assembly of the congregation" (Exod 12:6); "the assembly of the congregation of the sons of Israel" (Num 14:5), and "the assembly of God" (Neh 13:1). The related noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hL*h!q=</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">q=h!L*h</FONT>) means "assembly; community" (<i>HALOT </i>1080), e.g., in the idiom <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hL*h!q= /t^n&#180;</FONT> , "to hold an assembly": "I called a great assembly to deal with them" (Neh 5:7).<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="ecc.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Heb</i> "son of David" or "a son of David."<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="ecc.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:1)  While 1:1 says only "king in Jerusalem" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;lvWryb ilm</FONT> ), 1:12 adds "king over Israel in Jerusalem" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;lvWryb lar?y-lu ilm</FONT>). The LXX adds "Israel" in 1:1 to harmonize with 1:12; however, the MT makes sense as it stands. Apart from David, only Solomon was "king over Israel in Jerusalem" - unless the term "Israel" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lar?y</FONT>) in 1:12 is used for Judah or the post-exilic community. Solomon would fit the description of the author of this book, who is characterized by great wisdom (1:13, 16), great wealth (2:8), numerous servants (2:7), great projects (2:4-6), and the collection, editing and writings of many proverbs (12:9-10). All of this generally suggests Solomonic authorship. However, many scholars deny Solomonic authorship on the basis of linguistic and historical arguments.<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="ecc.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:1)  The form of the title is typical: (1) "the words of [the writer]," (2) his family name or name of his father, and (3) his social/political position in Israel (e.g., Prov. 22:17; 24:23; 30:1; 31:1). Sometimes, the writer's qualifications are given in the introduction to an OT book (e.g., Jer. 1:1; Amos 1:1). Qoheleth lists his qualifications at the end of the book (12:9-12).<br>

 <a name="fn6" href="ecc.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  <i>Heb</i> "futility of futilities." The phrase "absolutely futile" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ylbh lbh</FONT>) is a superlative genitive construction (GKC &#167;133.<i>i</i>). When a plural genitive follows a singular construct noun of the same root, it indicates the most outstanding example of the person or thing described. Examples: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yvdqh vdq</FONT> ("holy of holies"), i.e., "the most holy place" (Exod 26:33), <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yryvh ryv</FONT> ("song of songs"), i.e., "the most excellent song" (Song 1:1), <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yndah yndaw &lt;yhlah yhla </FONT>("the God of gods and Lord of lords"), i.e., "the highest God and the supreme Lord" (Deut 10:17). See also Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;80; <i>IBHS</i>, 154.<br>
 <a name="fn7" href="ecc.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  Although <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lK)</FONT> ("everything"; "all") is often used in an absolute or comprehensive sense (BDB 481 [1]), it is frequently used as a synecdoche of the general for the specific, that is, its sense is limited contextually to the topic at hand (BDB 482 [2]). This is particularly true of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lK)h^</FONT> (BDB 482 [2.b]) in which the article particularizes or limits the referent to the contextual or previously mentioned topic (e.g., Gen 16:12; 24:1; Exod 29:24; Lev 1:9, 13; 8:27; Deut 2:36; Josh 11:19 [see 2 Sam 19:31; 1 Kgs 14:26 = 2 Chr 12:9]; 21:43; 1 Sam 30:19; 2 Sam 17:3; 23:5; 24:23; 1 Kgs 6:18; 2 Kgs 24:16; Isa 29:11; 65:8; Jer 13:7, 10; Ezek 7:14; Pss 14:3; 49:18; 1 Chr 7:5; 28:19; 29:19; 2 Chr 28:6; 29:28; 31:5; 35:7; 36:17-18; Ezra 1:11; 2:42; 8:34-35; 10:17; Eccl 5:8). Thus, "all" does not always mean "all" in an absolute sense or universally in comprehension. In several cases the context limits its reference to two classes of objects or issues being discussed, so <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lK)h^</FONT> means "both" (e.g., 2:14; 3:19: 9:1, 2). Thus, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lK)h^</FONT> ("all"; "everything") refers only to what Qoheleth characterizes as "futile" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lb#h#</FONT>) in the context. Qoheleth does not mean that everything in an absolute, all-encompassing sense is futile. For example, the sovereign work of God is not "futile" (3:1-4:3); fearing God is not "futile" (2:26; 3:14-15; 11:9-12:1, 9, 13-14); and enjoying life as a righteous person under the blessing of God is not "futile" (2:24-26; 11:9-10). Only those objects or issues that are contextually placed under <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lK)</FONT> are designated as "futile" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lb#h#</FONT>). The context of 1:3-15 suggests that 1:2 refers to the futility of secular human endeavor. The content and referent of 1:3-15 determines the referent of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lK)h^</FONT> in 1:2.<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="ecc.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lb#h#</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">h#b#l</FONT>, "futile") is repeated five times within the eight words of this verse for emphasis. The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lbh</FONT> ("futile") is the key word in Ecclesiastes. The root is used in two ways in the OT, literally and figuratively. The literal, concrete sense is used in reference to the wind, man's transitory breath, evanescent vapor (Isa 57:13; Pss 62:10; 144:4; Prov 21:6; Job 7:16). In this sense, it is often a synonym for "breath" or "wind" (Eccl 1:14; Isa 57:13; Jer 10:14). The literal sense lent itself to metaphorical senses: (1) breath/vapor/wind is non-physical, evanescent, and lacks concrete substance thus, the connotation "unsubstantial" (Jer 10:15; 16:19; 51:18), "profitless" or "fruitless" (Ps 78:33; Prov 13:11), "worthless" (2 Kgs 17:15; Jer 2:5; 10:3), "pointless" (Prov 21:6), "futile" (Lam 4:17; Eccl 1:2, 14; 2:1, 14-15), (2) breath/vapor/wind is transitory and fleeting--thus, the connotation "fleeting" or "transitory" (Prov 31:30; Eccl 6:12; 7:15; 9:9; 11:10; Job 7:16) and (3) breath/vapor/wind cannot be seen thus, the idea of "obscure," "dark," "difficult to understand," "enigmatic" (Eccl 11:10). See <i>HALOT </i>236-37; BDB 210-11; <i>TWAT</i> 2.334-43; <i>TDOT</i> 3.313-20; <i>THAT</i> 1.467-69; <i>TWOT</i> 1.204-05. The metaphorical sense is used with the following synonyms: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WhT)</FONT> ("empty," "vanity"; Isa 49:4), <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qyr!</FONT> ("profitless," "useless"; Isa 30:7; Eccl 6:11), and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lyu!oh aO</FONT> ("worthless," "profitless"; Is 30:6; 57:12; Jer 16:19). It is parallel to "few days" and "[days] which he passes like a shadow" (Eccl 6:12). It is used in reference to youth and vigor (11:10) and life (6:12; 7:15; 9:9), which are "transitory" or "fleeting." The most common parallels to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lbh</FONT> in Ecclesiastes are the phrases "chasing after the wind" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jwr twur</FONT>) in 2:11, 17, 26; 7:14 and "what profit?" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/wrty-hm</FONT>) or "no profit" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/wrty /ya</FONT>) in 2:11; 3:19; 6:9, 19. It is used in reference to enigmas in life (6:2; 8:10, 14) and to the future which is obscure (11:8). It is often used in antithesis to terms connoting value: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bof</FONT> ("good," "benefit," "advantage") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ort=y{</FONT> ("profit," "advantage," "gain"). Because the concrete picture of the "wind" lends itself to the figurative connotation "futile," the motto "This is futile" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lb#h# hz#</FONT>) is often used with the metaphor, "like striving after the wind" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">j^Wr tWur=</FONT>)--a graphic picture of an expenditure of effort in vain because no one can catch the wind by chasing it (e.g., 1:14, 17; 2:11, 17, 26; 4:4, 6, 16; 6:9). Although it is the key word in Ecclesiastes, it should not be translated the same way in every place.<b> </b><br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:2)  The motto <i>Everything is futile!</i> is the theme of the book. Its occurs at the beginning (1:2) and end of the book (12:8), forming an envelope structure (<i>inclusio</i>). Everything described in 1:2-12:8 is the supporting proof of the thesis of 1:2. With few exceptions (e.g., 2:24-26; 3:14-15; 11:9-12:1, 9), everything described in 1:2-12:8 is characterized as "futile" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">h#b#l</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="ecc.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  The term "profit" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ort=y{</FONT>) is used in Ecclesiastes to evaluate the ultimate benefit/effects of human activities, as is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bof</FONT> ("good; worthwhile") as well (e.g., 2:1, 3). While some relative advantage/profit is recognized (e.g., light over darkness, and wisdom over folly), Qoheleth denies the ultimate advantage of all human endeavors (e.g., 2:11, 15).<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="ecc.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  The use of the relative pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">v#</FONT> ("which")--rather than the more common <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> ("which")--is a linguistic feature that is often used to try to date the Book of Ecclesiastes. Noting that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">v#</FONT> is the dominant relative pronoun in Mishnaic Hebrew and that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> does not appear as frequently (M. Jastrow, <i>Dictionary</i>, 130), many scholars conclude that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> is early and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">v#</FONT> is late. They conclude that the use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">v</FONT> in Ecclesiastes points to a late date for the book. However, as Samuel-Kings suggest, the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">v</FONT> versus <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> phenomena may simply be a dialectical issue: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> is commonly used in the south, and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">v</FONT> in the north. The use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">v</FONT> in Ecclesiastes may indicate that the book was written in a northern rather than a southern province, not that it is a late book. This is supported from related Akkadian terms which occur in texts from the same periods: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> is related to <i>asru</i> ("place") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">v</FONT> is related to <i>sa</i> ("what").<br>
 <a name="fn11" href="ecc.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:3)  The Hebrew root <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u*m^l</FONT> ("toil") is repeated here for emphasis: "What gain does anyone have in his <i>toil</i> with which he <i>toils</i>." For all his efforts, man's endeavors and secular achievements will not produce anything of ultimate value that will radically revolutionize anything in the world. The term "toil" is used in a pejorative sense to emphasize that the only thing that man obtains ultimately from all his efforts is weariness and exhaustion. Due to sin, mankind has been cursed with the futility of his labor that renders work a "toilsome" task (Gen 3:17-19). Although it was not yet revealed to Qoheleth, God will one day deliver the redeemed from this plight in the future kingdom when man's labor will no longer be toilsome, but profitable, fulfilling, and enjoyable (Isa 65:17-23).<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="ecc.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  <i>Heb</i> "under the sun."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:3)  This rhetorical question expects a negative answer: "Man has no gain in all his toil." Ecclesiastes often uses rhetorical questions in this manner (e.g., 2:2; 3:9; 6:8, 11, 12; see Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 949).<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="ecc.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  The participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">El@h)</FONT> ("to walk; to go") emphasizes continual, durative, uninterrupted action (present universal use of participle). The root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ilh</FONT> is repeated in this section (1:4a, 6a, 6b, 7a, 7b, 7c) to emphasize the continual action and constant motion of everything in nature. Despite the continual action of everything in nature, there is no completion, attainment or rest for anything. The first use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ilh</FONT> is in reference to man; all subsequent usages are in reference to nature--illustrations of the futility of human endeavor. Note: All the key terms used in 1:4 to describe the futility of human endeavor are repeated in 1:5-11 as illustrations from nature. The literary monotony in 1:4-11 mirrors the actual monotony of human action that repeats itself with no real change.<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="ecc.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  The participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aB*</FONT> ("to go") emphasizes continual, durative, uninterrupted action (present universal use of participle).

 <a name="fn17" href="ecc.htm#fnB17"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;l*ou</FONT> has a wide range of meanings: (1) indefinite time: "long time; duration," often "eternal" or "eternity"; (2) future time: "things to come"; and (3) past time: "a long time back," that is, the dark age of prehistory (<i>HALOT </i>798-99; BDB 762-64). It may also denote an indefinite period of "continuous existence" (BDB 762 [2.b]). It is used in this sense in reference to things that remain the same for long periods: the earth (Eccl 1:4), the heavens (Ps 148:6), ruined cities (Isa 25:2; 32:14), ruined lands (Jer 18:16), nations (Isa 47:7), families (Ps 49:12; Isa 14:20), the dynasty of Saul (1 Sam 13:13), the house of Eli (2 Sam 2:30), continual enmity between nations (Ezek 25:15; 35:5), the exclusion of certain nations from the assembly (Deut 23:4; Neh 13:1), a perpetual reproach (Ps 78:66). <br>

The participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aB</FONT> ("to go") emphasizes continual, durative, uninterrupted action (present universal use of participle): the sun is continually rising and continually setting day after day. The repetition of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aB</FONT> in 1:4-5 creates a comparison between the relative futility of all human endeavor ("a generation comes and a generation goes" [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aB</FONT>]) with the relative futility of the action of the sun ("the sun rises and the sun goes" [i.e., "sets," <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aB</FONT>]).<br>
 <a name="fn20" href="ecc.htm#fnB20"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:5) <i>Heb</i><b> </b>"hastens" or "pants." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[av</FONT> has a three-fold range of meanings: (1) "to gasp; to pant," (2) "to pant after; to long for," and (3) "to hasten; to hurry" (KBL3 937; BDB 983). The related Aramaic root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[wv</FONT> means "to be thirsty; to be parched." The Hebrew verb is used of "gasping" for breath, like a woman in the travail of childbirth (Isa 42:14); "panting" with eagerness or desire (Job 5:5; 7:2; 36:20; Ps 119:131; Jer 2:24) or "panting" with fatigue (Jer 14:6; Eccl 1:5). Here <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[av</FONT> personifies the sun, panting with fatigue, as it hastens to its destination (BDB 983 [1]). The participle form depicts continual, uninterrupted, durative action (present universal use). Like the sun, man--for all his efforts--never really changes anything; all he accomplishes in his toil is to wear himself out.<br>
 <a name="fn21" href="ecc.htm#fnB21"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jrz</FONT> is repeated in this verse to emphasize that the sun is locked into a never changing, ever repeating monotonous cycle: rising, setting, rising, setting. In 1:5a the perfect tense focuses on the starting point of the cycle (present definite use of perfect): "the sun rises" (at a definite point in time). However, in 1:5b the participle emphasizes the continual, uninterrupted cycle of the sunrise (present universal use of participle): "there it continually rises again."<br>

 <a name="fn23" href="ecc.htm#fnB23"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  The Hebrew root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bbs</FONT> ("to circle around") is repeated four times in this verse to depict the wind's continual motion: "The wind circles around (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bb@os</FONT>)...round and round (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bb@s) bb@os</FONT>)...its circuits (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wytbybs</FONT>)." This repetition is designed for a rhetorical purpose--to emphasize that the wind is locked into a never ending cycle. This vicious circle of monotonous action does not change anything. The participle form is used three times to emphasize continual, uninterrupted action (present universal use of participle). Despite the fact that the wind is always changing direction, nothing really new ever happens. The constant shifting of the wind cannot hide the fact that this is nothing but a repeated cycle; nothing new happens here (e.g., 1:9-10).<br>

The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yklh</FONT> (Qal active participle masculine plural from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ilh</FONT> ["to walk"]) emphasizes continual, durative, uninterrupted action (present universal use of participle). This may be an example of personification; this verb is normally used in reference to the human activity of walking. Qoheleth compares the flowing of river waters to the action of walking to draw out the comparison between the actions of man (1:4) and the actions of nature (1:5-11).<br>

The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ybv</FONT> (Qal active participle masculine plural from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv</FONT> ["to return"]) emphasizes the continual, durative action of the waters. The root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWv</FONT> is repeated in 1:6-7 to emphasize that everything in nature (e.g., wind and water) continually repeats its actions. For all of the repetition of the cycles of nature, nothing changes; all the constant motion produces nothing new.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:7)  This verse does not refer to the cycle of evaporation or the return of water by underground streams, as sometimes suggested. Rather, it describes the constant flow of river waters to the sea. For all the action of the water--endless repetition and water constantly in motion--there is nothing new accomplished.<br>

The terms <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rmayv rbd vy</FONT> may be an interrogative clause without an introductory interrogative particle (GKC &#167;150.<i>a</i>). In questions, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vy</FONT> often implies doubt about the existence of something (BDB 441 [2.b]). The LXX rendered it as a question, as do most English versions: "Is there anything of which it can be said...?" (KJV, ASV, RSV, MLB, NEB, NASB, NIV, NRSV, AB). On the other hand, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vy</FONT> is used elsewhere in the Book of Ecclesiastes as a predication of existence ("There is...") to assert the existence of something (2:13, 21; 4:8, 9; 5:13[12]; 6:1, 11; 7:15; 8:6, 14; 9:4; 10:5). <i>HALOT</i> 443 (2) renders <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rbd vy</FONT> as "There is something...." This view is taken by several translations: "Even the thing of which we say..." (NAB), "Men may say of something ..." (Moffatt), and "Sometimes there is a phenomena of which they say..." (NJPS).<br>
 <a name="fn38" href="ecc.htm#fnB38"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  The perfect tense verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hyh</FONT> refers to a past perfect situation: it describes an action that is viewed as a remote past event from the perspective of the past. This past perfect situation is brought out by the temporal adverb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rbK</FONT> "already" (<i>HALOT </i>459; BDB 460; cf. 1:10; 2:12, 16; 3:15; 4:2; 6:10; 9:6-7).  The expression <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rbK</FONT> + <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hyh</FONT> connotes a past perfect nuance: "it has already been" (Eccl 1:10; see BDB 460). <br>

 <a name="fn41" href="ecc.htm#fnB41"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:11) <i>Heb</i><b> </b>"There is no remembrance of former things." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ynvar</FONT> ("former things") is the masculine plural form of the adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/wvar</FONT> ("former, first, chief"; BDB 911). When used in a temporal sense, the singular denotes "former" in time (BDB 911 [1.a]) or "first" in time (BDB 911 [2.a]). The plural <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ynvar</FONT> is only used to denote "former" in time: "former persons," i.e., ancestors, men of old (e.g., Lev 26:45; Deut 19:14; Job 18:20; Isa 61:4; Ps 79:8; Sirach 4:16) or "former things," i.e., past events (e.g., Isa 41:22; 42:9; 43:9, 18; 46:9; 48:3). See BDB 911 (1.a), which suggests that this usage refers to "former persons." This approach is adopted by several translations: "men of old" (NEB, NAB, NIV, Moffatt), "people of long ago" (NRSV), "earlier ones" (NJPS), "earlier people" (AB), and "former generations" (ASV, YLT). On the other hand, this Hebrew phrase may be nuanced "former things" (KBL3 866). This is adopted by some translations: "former things" (KJV, RSV), "former times" (MLB), and "earlier things" (NASB). Although future generations are mentioned in 1:11, what they will not remember is the past events. The context of 1:3-11 focuses on human achievement, that is, former things.<br>

When used in a temporal sense, it may mean (1) "later one; (2) "in the future"; (3) "last"; or (4) "at the last" or "in the end" (<i>HALOT </i>36 [2]). The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ynrja</FONT> may be used in reference to (1) future generations, e.g., Deut 29:21; Pss 48:14; 78:4, 6; 102:19; Job 18:20; Eccl 4:16, or (2) future events, e.g., Neh 8:18 (BDB 30). BDB 30 (b) suggests that this usage refers to "future generations," while <i>HALOT</i> 36 (c) suggests future events. As mentioned in the previous note, it probably refers to future events rather than future generations.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:11)  The Hebrew terms translated <i>former events</i> and <i>future events</i> create a merism (two polar extremes encompass everything in between). This encompasses all secular achievements in human history past to future things yet to be done.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (1:11)  According to Qoheleth, nothing new really happens under the sun (1:9). Apparent observations of what appears to be revolutionary are due to a lack of remembrance by subsequent generations of what happened long before their time in past generations (1:10-11a). And what will happen in future generations will not be remembered by the subsequent generations to arise after them (1:11b).<br>

The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ybl</FONT> ("my heart") is an example of synecdoche of part (heart) for the whole (myself). Qoheleth uses this figurative expression frequently in the book. On the other hand, in Hebrew mentality, the term "heart" is frequently associated with one's thoughts and reasoning; thus, this might be a metonymy of association (heart = thoughts). The equivalent English idiom would be "I applied my mind."<br>
 <a name="fn46" href="ecc.htm#fnB46"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:13) <i>Heb</i><b> </b>"to seek and to search out" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rwtlw vwrdl</FONT>). This is an example of a verbal hendiadys (the use of two synonymous verbs to state a common idea in an emphatic manner). The terms are used because they are closely related synonyms; therefore, the similarities in meaning should be emphasized rather than the distinctions in meaning. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vrd</FONT> means "to inquire about; to investigate; to search out; to study" (<i>HALOT </i>233; BDB 205). This verb is used literally of the physical activity of investigating a matter by examining the physical evidence and interviewing eye-witnesses (e.g., Judg 6:29; Deut 13:15; 17:4, 9; 19:18), and figuratively (hypocatasasis) of mentally investigating abstract concepts (e.g., Eccl 1:13; Isa 1:17; 16:5; Pss 111:2; 119:45). Similarly, the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rWT</FONT> means "to explore; to seek out" (KBL3 1023 [2]; BDB 1064 [2]). The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rWt</FONT> is used literally of the physical action of exploring physical territory (Num 13:16-17; 14:6, 34-36; Job 39:8), and figuratively (hypocatastasis) of mentally exploring things (Eccl 1:13; 7:25; 9:1).<br>

It is parallel with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lbh</FONT> "futile" in 4:8, and describes a "grave misfortune" in 5:13. The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ynu</FONT> ("business") refers to something that keeps a person occupied or busy: "business; affair; task; occupation" (<i>HALOT </i>857; BDB 775). The related verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnu</FONT> II means "to be occupied, to be busy with" (with the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B=</FONT>), e.g., Eccl 1:13; 3:10; 5:19 (<i>HALOT </i>854; BDB 775). The noun is from the Aramaic loanword <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">anynu</FONT> ("concern, care"). The verb is related to the Aramaic verb "to try hard," the Arabic verb "to be busily occupied; to worry to be a matter of concern," and the Old South Arabic root "to be troubled; to strive with" (<i>HALOT </i>854). The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ur /ynu</FONT> is treated creatively by English translations: "sore travail" (KJV, ASV), "sad travail" (YLT), "painful occupation" (Douay), "sorry business" (NEB), "sorry task" (Moffatt), "evil task" (AB), "thankless task" (NAB), "grievous task" (NASB), "trying task" (MLB), "unhappy business" (RSV, NRSV, NJPS), and "heavy burden" (NIV).<br>
 <a name="fn52" href="ecc.htm#fnB52"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13)  The syntax of this line in Hebrew is intentionally redundant, e.g. (literally), "It is a grievous task [or, "unpleasant business"] that God has given to the sons of men to be occupied with it." The referent of the third masculine singular suffix on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">oB tonu&amp;l^</FONT> ("to be occupied with it") is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ur /ynu</FONT> ("a grievous task"; "a rotten business").<br>

It is an Aramaic loanword meaning "deficit." The related verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rsj*</FONT> means "to lack; to be in need of; to decrease; to lessen [in number]"; the related noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rs#j)</FONT> refers to "one in want of"; and the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rs#j#</FONT> means "poverty; want" (<i>HALOT </i>338; BDB 341). It refers to what is absent (zero in terms of quantity) rather than what is deficient (poor in terms of quality).

It is also misunderstood by a few English versions: "nor can you count up the defects in life" (Moffatt); "the number of fools is infinite" (Douay).

The term "heart" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bl</FONT>) is a synecdoche of part ("heart") for the whole (the whole person), and thus means "I said to myself" (see Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 648).<br>
 <a name="fn83" href="ecc.htm#fnB83"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:1)  The Hebrew verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkl</FONT> ("Come!") is a weakened imperative, used merely as an introductory word, e.g., Gen 19:32; 31:44; Judg 19:11; 1 Sam 9:9-10; 11:14; 2 Kgs 3:7; Ps 66:5; Song 7:12; Isa 1:18; 2:3; Mic 4:2 (<i>HALOT </i>246 [2]; BDB 234 [I.5.f.2]). Whenever <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkl</FONT> introduces an exhortation, it functions as an invitation to the audience to adopt a course of action that will be beneficial to the addressee or mutually beneficial to both the speaker and the addressee. Here, Qoheleth personifies his "heart" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ybl</FONT>) and addresses himself. The examination of self-indulgent pleasure is designed to be beneficial to Qoheleth. The purpose clause of v. 1 is indicated by the volitive sequence: imperative (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hk*l=</FONT>) followed by a cohortative (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hk*S=n~a&amp;</FONT>) followed by <i>vav</i> + imperative (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ha@r+W</FONT>).<br>

The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hsn</FONT> ("to test") is often used as a synonym with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/jB</FONT> ("to examine"; BDB 103 and 650 [1]), and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tudl</FONT> ("to ascertain"; Deut 8:2).<br>

The parallelism in 2:2 between <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hjmv</FONT> ("pleasure") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qwjc</FONT> ("laughter; frivolous merrymaking"), which always appears in the context of banqueting, drinking, and merrymaking, suggests that the pejorative sense is in view in this context.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:1)  The statement <i>I will examine self-indulgent pleasure</i> is a figurative expression known as metonymy of association. As 2:1-3 makes clear, it is not so much Qoheleth who is put to the test with pleasure, but rather that pleasure is put to the test by Qoheleth. <br>

The volitive sequence of the cohortative (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hk*S=n~a&amp;</FONT> "I will test you") followed by <i>vav</i> + imperative (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ha@r+W</FONT> "and see!") denotes purpose/result: "I will test you...in order to see..." (see <i>IBHS</i>, 577). The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ha*r*</FONT> ("to see") has a broad range of meanings (e.g., 16 categories listed in KBL3). In this context it means "to discover; to perceive; to discern; to understand" (KBL3 1159 [13]; BDB 907 [5]).<br>
 <a name="fn87" href="ecc.htm#fnB87"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:1)  The phrase "to see what is good" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">har</FONT> "to see" + <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bof</FONT> "good") is repeated twice in 2:1-3.

It is used to make the narrative graphic and vivid, enabling the reader to enter into the surprise of the speaker (BDB 244 [c]). This is an example of the heterosis of the deictic particle ("Behold!") for a verb of perception ("I found"). See Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 510-34.<br>

See <i>HALOT </i>1315; BDB 966. In Ecclesiastes, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qwjc</FONT> ("laughter") is always used in contexts of self-indulgent banqueting, drinking, frivolous partying and merrymaking (Eccl 2:2; 7:3, 6; 10:19). It is distinct from "healthy" joy and laughter (Ps 126:2; Job 8:21). The connotation of "frivolous merrymaking" fits this context best.<br>

 <a name="fn97" href="ecc.htm#fnB97"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:3)  Or "I sought to cheer my flesh with wine." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Eovm=!!l!</FONT> (Qal infinitive construct from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ev^m*</FONT> "to draw, pull") functions in a complementary sense with the preceding verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rWT</FONT> ("to examine"): <i>Heb</i> "I sought to draw out my flesh with wine" or "I [mentally] explored [the effects] of drawing out my flesh with wine." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ev^m*</FONT> means "to draw; to drag along; to lead" (BDB 604) or "to draw out; to stretch out [to full length]; to drag; to pull; to seize; to carry off; to pull; to go" (<i>HALOT </i>645-46). BDB 604 (7) suggests that this use be nuanced "to draw; to attract; to gratify" the flesh, that is, "to cheer." While this meaning is not attested elsewhere in the OT, it is found in Mishnaic Hebrew: "to attract" (Qal), e.g., "it is different with heresy, because it attracts [i.e., persuades, offers inducements]" (<i>b. Avodah Zarah 27b</i>) and "to be attracted, carried away, seduced" (Ithpeel), e.g., "he was drawn after them, he indulged in the luxuries of the palace" (<i>b. Shabbat 147b</i>). See M. Jastrow, <i>Dictionary</i>, 108-109. Here it denotes "to stretch; to draw out [to full length]," that is, "to revive; to restore" the body (<i>HALOT </i>646 [3]). The LXX rendered <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Eovm=!!l!</FONT> with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejklusai </FONT>from <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejkluw</FONT> ("to relax"): "how to relax my body with wine." The context suggests that Qoheleth's experiment in 2:1-3 was not how to relax his body with wine, but whether self-indulgence with wine had any real value or profit. The statement is a metonymy of cause (i.e., indulging the flesh with wine) for effect (i.e., the effects of self-indulgence).<br>

With an imperfect verb (such as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ha#r+a#</FONT> Qal imperfect first common singular from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">har</FONT> "to see"), the compound construction <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rv#a&amp; du^</FONT> ("until") usually refers to future time (Gen 27:44; 29:8; Exod 23:30; 24:14; Lev 22:4; Num 11:20; 20:17; 1 Sam 22:3; Hos 5:15), but it also rarely refers to past time (Jonah 4:5; Eccl 2:3); see BDB 725 (2.1.a.<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">b</FONT>). Jo&uuml;on notes that when the compound construction <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rv#a&amp; du^</FONT> ("until") is occasionally used with an imperfect depicting past action to denote a virtual nuance of purpose: "until" = "so that," e.g., Jon. 4:5; Eccl 2:3 (Jo&uuml;on-Muraoka, <i>Grammar</i>, &#167;113.k). <br>

This phrase is an idiom that means, "during all their lives" (BDB 709 [1.a]), "during their total [short] time of life," that is, "as long as they live" (<i>HALOT </i>608 [3.d]). Ecclesiastes often emphasizes the brevity of life (e.g., 5:17; 6:12; 9:9). The LXX rendered <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rP^s=m!</FONT> ("number") in a woodenly literal sense: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajriqmon</FONT> ("the number [of days of their lives]"). Several English translations adopt a similar approach: "all the days of their life" (ASV, Douay, AB) and "the number of days of their lives" (YLT). However, this idiom is handled well by a number of English translations: "during the few days of their lives" (RSV, NRSV, NASB, NIV, Moffatt, NJPS), "during the limited days of their life" (NAB), and "throughout the brief span of their lives" (NEB).<br>

The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ycum</FONT> ("my works") has been handled in two basic ways: (1) great works or projects, and (2) possessions. Both approaches are reflected in the major English translations: "works" (KJV, NEB, NAB, ASV, NASB, MLB, RSV, Douay, Moffatt, AB), "projects" (NIV), and "possessions" (NJPS).<br>

The original Old Persian term <i>pairidaeza</i> designated the enclosed parks and pleasure-grounds that were the exclusive domain of the Persian kings and nobility (<i>HALOT </i>963; LSJ 1308). The related Babylonian term <i>pardesu</i> "marvelous garden" referred to the enclosed parks of the kings (AHw 833a and 1582a).

 <a name="fn113" href="ecc.htm#fnB113"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:7)  The phrase "sons of the house" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tyb ynB</FONT>) appears to be parallel to "a son of my house" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yt!yB-/B#</FONT>) which refers to a person born into slavery from male and female servants in the master's possession, e.g., Eleazar of Damascus (Gen 15:3). The phrase appears to denote children born from male and female slaves already in his possession, that is, "homeborn slaves" (NASB) or "other slaves who were born in my house" (NIV). Apparently confusing the sense of the phrase with the referent of the phrase in Gen 15:3, NJPS erroneously suggests "stewards" in Eccl 2:7.<br>
 <a name="fn114" href="ecc.htm#fnB114"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:8)  The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hL*g%s=</FONT> denotes "personal property" (<i>HALOT </i>742 [1]; <i>TWOT</i> 2.617) or "valued property; personal treasure" (BDB 688 [2]). Elsewhere, it refers to a king's silver and gold (1 Chr 27:3). It is related to Akkadian <i>sug/kullu</i> "flock" (AHw 1053-54) and <i>sikiltu</i> "private property [belonging to the king]" (AHw 1041a).

 <a name="fn115" href="ecc.htm#fnB115"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:8)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gwnut</FONT> has a three-fold range of meanings: (1) "luxury; comfort" (Mic 2:9; Prov 19:10; Sir 6:28; 11:27; 14:16; 37:29; 41:1); (2) "pleasure; delight" of sexual love (Song 7:7); and (3) "daintiness; feminine" (Mic 1:16); see KBL3 1036; BDB 772. The related adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gn{u*</FONT> ("pampered; dainty") is used to describe a pampered woman (Deut 28:56), to personify Babylon as a delicate woman (Isa 47:1), and to ridicule delicate men (Deut 28:54); see <i>HALOT </i>851; BDB 772. It is related to the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gn\u)</FONT> ("pleasure; exquisite delight; daintiness"; see <i>HALOT </i>851; BDB 772) and the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gn{u*</FONT> which means "to be soft; to be delicate" and "pleasurable" (Pual) and "to pamper oneself" and "to take delight or pleasure in" (<i>HALOT </i>851; BDB 772). The root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gnu</FONT> is paralleled with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Er)</FONT> (Deut 28:56), <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Er~</FONT> (Deut 28:54), and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hK*r~</FONT> (Deut 28:56) with the meanings "delicate; soft; tender; weak; coddled; pampered." The context of Eccl 2:4-11 suggests that it denotes either "luxury" as in "the luxuries of commoners" (NJPS) or "pleasure; delight" as in "the delights of men" (KJV, NASB, NIV). Part of the difficulty in determining the meaning of this term is caused by the ambiguity in meaning of its referent, namely, the appositional phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toDv!w+ hD&#180;v!</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">v!DD*h w+v!DDot</FONT>), the meaning of which is uncertain (see the note on the phrase "a harem of beautiful concubines" at the end of this verse).<br>
 <a name="fn116" href="ecc.htm#fnB116"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:8)  The meaning of the superlative genitive construction <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toDv!w+ hD&#180;v!</FONT> is uncertain because the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hD&#180;v!</FONT> occurs only here in the OT. There are four basic approaches to the phrase: (1) Most scholars suggest that it refers to a royal harem, and that it is in apposition to "the sensual delights of men" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;dah ynb tgwnutw</FONT>). There are four variations of this approach: (a) KBL3 (950) relates <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hD&#180;v!</FONT> to Ugaritic <i>sd</i> "Dame; lady" and Arabic <i>sat</i> "Dame; lady." (b) German scholars relate it to Assyrian <i>sadadu </i>"love" (Delitzsch, Konig, Wildeboer, Siegfried); however, BDB questions this connection (BDB 994). (c) Ibn Ezra relates it to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dv^</FONT> II "plunder; spoil" or <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hdv</FONT> "[women] taken by violence," and suggests that it refers to the occupants of the royal harem. (d) BDB connect it to the Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dv^</FONT> I "breast" (e.g., Isa 28:9; Ezek 16:7; 23:3, 21, 34; Hos 2:4; 9:14; Song 1:13; 4:5; 7:4, 8, 9; 8:1, 8, 10; Job 3:12). ). BDB 994 suggests that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hdv</FONT> "breast" is related to the cognate Arabic and Aramaic roots meaning "breast." This would be a synecdoche of part (i.e., breast) for the whole (i.e., woman), similar to the idiom "one womb, two wombs" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ytmjr &lt;jr</FONT>) where "womb" = woman (Judg 5:30). This is the approach taken by most English versions: "many concubines" (NASB, RSV, NRSV), "a wife and wives" (YLT), "women of all sorts" (AB), "mistresses galore" (MLB), "many a mistress" (Moffatt) and "a harem" (NIV). This is the approach suggested by the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project: "une femme et des femmes" = one or two women (e.g., Judg 5:30); see Dominque Barthelemy, ed. et al., <i>Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i> (New York: United Bible Society, 1979), 3.566. (2) Two translations (NJPS and <i>La sainte Bible</i>) connect it to the Mishnaic Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hD&#180;v!</FONT> &gt; <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hD&#180;yv!</FONT> "a strong box; chest" (M. Jastrow, <i>Dictionary</i>, 1558), and render the phrase "coffers and coffers of them" in apposition to the phrase "the luxuries of commoners" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;dah ynb tgwnutw</FONT>). (3) KJV and ASV take the phrase in apposition to "male and female singers" and translate it as "musical instruments." However, there is no known Hebrew term that would justify this approach. (4) The LXX related the term to the Aramaic root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">adv</FONT> "to pour out [wine]," and rendered the phrase as <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oijnocoon kai oijnocoa"</FONT> "a male-butler and female cupbearers." Aquilla took a similar approach: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kulikion kai kulikia</FONT> "wine cups and wine vessels." This is reflected in the Vulgate and the Douay version: "cups and vessels to serve to pour out wine." Although the semantic meaning of the terms <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toDv!w+ hD&#180;v!</FONT> (<i>Heb</i> "a breast of breasts"?) is uncertain, the grammatical/syntactical form of the phrase is straightforward: (1) It is in apposition to the preceding line, "the delights of the son of men" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;dah ynb tgwnutw</FONT>). (2) The phrase is a superlative genitive construction. When the genitive is plural and it follows a construct noun from the same root which is singular, it indicates the best or most outstanding example of the person or thing so described. Examples: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yvdqh vdq</FONT> ("the holy of holies," i.e., the most holy place"; Exod 26:33), <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yryvh ryv</FONT> ("the song of songs," i.e., "the most excellent song"; Song 1:1), <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yndah yndaw &lt;yhlah yhla</FONT> ("the God of gods and Lord of lords," i.e., "the Highest God and the Supreme Lord"; Deut 10:17); and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ydbu dbu</FONT> ("a slave of slaves," i.e., "the most abject slave"; Gen 9:25). See GKC &#167;133.<i>i</i>; Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;80; <i>IBHS</i>, 154. If the semantic meaning of the terms <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toDv!w+ hD&#180;v!</FONT> denotes "a breast of breasts" or "a lady of ladies" (Eccl 2:8, but see the previous note on the phrase "a man's sensual delights"), the superlative genitive construction may connote "the most beautiful breasts" (metonymy of part for the whole) or "the most beautiful woman." This might refer to a harem of concubines or to one woman (the wife of the king?) who was the most beautiful woman in the land.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:8)  <i>Concubines</i> were slave women in ancient Near Eastern societies who were the legal property of their master, but who could have legitimate sexual relations with their master. A concubine's status was more elevated than a mere servant, but she was not free and did not have the legal rights of a free wife. The children of a concubine could, in some instances, become equal heirs with the children of the free wife. After the period of the Judges concubines may have become more of a royal prerogative (2 Sam 21:10-14; 1 Kgs 11:3).<br>

The metonymy is indicated by several factors: (1) The 3ms suffix ("it") on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wnjyna</FONT> "I must leave it" in 2:18, and on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wnnty</FONT> "I must give it" in 2:21 refer to his wealth, that is, the fruit of his labor. (2) In 2:21 the 3ms suffix on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wb-lmu alv</FONT> ("who did not work for it") refers to the inheritance that Qoheleth must turn over to his successor, namely, the fruit of his labor. (3) While he himself enjoyed the fruit of his labor, he despaired that he had to turn the fruit of his labor over to his successor: "So I loathed all the [fruit of] my labor" (2:18a) and "I began to despair about the [fruit of] my labor" (2:20a). Although most translations render <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ylmu</FONT> as "my toil" in 2:18, the metonymy is recognized by several English translations: "So I hated all <i>the fruit of</i> my labor for which I had labored" (NASB); "So I detested all <i>the fruits of</i> my labor" (NAB); "I hated all <i>the things</i> I had toiled for" (NIV); and "So I loathed all the <i>wealth</i> that I <i>was gaining</i>" (NJPS).<br>

There is no guarantee that one's heir will be wise and be a good steward of this wealth, or be foolish and squander it--in which case, the former man's entire life's work would be in vain.<br>

There are two approaches to the syntax of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wqlj</FONT> ("his inheritance"): (1) The 3ms suffix is a subjective genitive: "his inheritance" = the inheritance which he must give to his heir. The referent of the 3ms suffix is Qoheleth in 2:21a who worked hard to amass the fortune. The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qlj</FONT> ("inheritance") functions as an adverbial accusative of state (GKC &#167;118.<i>a</i>) or a predicate accusative (Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;57): "He must give it [i.e., his fortune] as an inheritance." (2) The 3ms suffix is an objective genitive: "his inheritance" = the inheritance which the heir will receive from Qoheleth. The referent of the 3ms suffix is the heir in 2:21b. The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qlj</FONT> ("inheritance") functions as the accusative direct object in apposition (Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;71) to the 3ms suffix on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WNn\T=y]</FONT> "he must give it" (Qal imperfect 3ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/tn</FONT> + 3ms suffix): "He must give it, namely, his inheritance, to one who did not work for it."<br>
 <a name="fn176" href="ecc.htm#fnB176"><sup>95</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:21)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hur</FONT> ("evil") probably means "misfortune" (<i>HALOT </i>1263 [4]) or "injustice; wrong" (<i>HALOT </i>1262 [2.b]). The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbr hur</FONT> connotes "grave injustice" or "great misfortune" (e.g., Eccl 2:17; 5:12, 15; 6:1; 10:5). It is expressed well as: "This too is...a great misfortune" (NAB, NIV, MLB) and "utterly wrong!" (NEB).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:21)  Verses 18-21 are arranged into two sub-units (2:18-19 and 2:20-21).

(2) Reason for the lament: "I must turn over the fruit of my labor to the hands of my successor" and "he must hand over the fruit of his work as an inheritance." (3) Description of successor: "who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool?" and "he did not work for it."

 <a name="fn178" href="ecc.htm#fnB178"><sup>97</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:23)  The syntax of this verse has been interpreted in two different ways: (1) The phrase "all his days" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wymy-lk</FONT>) is the subject of a verbless clause, and the noun "pain" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ybakm</FONT>) is a predicate nominative or a predicate of apposition (see Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;71). Likewise, the noun "his work" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wnynu</FONT>) is the subject of a second verbless clause, and the term "vexation" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">sukw</FONT>) is a predicate nominative: "All his days are pain, and his work is vexation." (2) The noun "his work" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wnynu</FONT>) is the subject of both nouns, "pain and vexation" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">sukw</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ybakm</FONT>), which are predicate nominatives, while the phrase "all his days" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wymy-lk</FONT>) is an adverbial accusative functioning temporally: "All day long, his work is pain and vexation." The latter option is supported by the parallelism between "even at night" and "all day long." This verse draws out an ironic contrast/comparison between his physical toil/labor during the day and his emotional anxiety at night. Even at night, he has no break!<br>
 <a name="fn179" href="ecc.htm#fnB179"><sup>98</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:24)  The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B=</FONT> on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;d*a*B*</FONT> has been taken in two ways: (1) W.

(2) D. R. Glenn argues that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B=</FONT> denotes advantage, and taking <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bof</FONT> ("good") in reference to the enjoyment theme of 2:24-26, renders the line: "There is nothing better <i>for</i> a man than..." (this assumes a comparative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m!</FONT> on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lk^aY)v#m!</FONT>; see text critical note on the word "than" below). The latter is preferred for two reasons: (1) The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B=</FONT> is used with a similar idiom in 3:12 in collocation with the particle phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;a</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yk</FONT> ("except"): "There is nothing better...than to rejoice/be happy" (NASB, NIV). (2) The theme of 2:1-26 focuses on the futility of human toil, concluding that the only real reward that man has in his labor is to find enjoyment in it (e.g., 2:10, 24-26). The section says nothing about man's inherent sinful nature.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (2:24)  The phrase translated <i>is a sovereign gift of God</i> (<i>Heb</i> "is from the hand of God") is an anthropomorphism (depicting God, who is an invisible spirit, in the form of man with hands) or anthropopatheia (depicting God performing human-like actions). The "hand of God" is a figure often used to portray God's sovereign providence and benevolence (see Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 878). The phrase "the hand of God" is often used to connote the favor or grace of God (2 Chr 30:12; Ezra 7:9; 8:18; Neh 2:8, 18); see BDB 390 (1.e.2).<br>

The Vulgate renders this term as "to enjoy." The Greek versions (LXX, Theodotion) and the Syriac Peshitta, however, did not understand this <i>hapax</i>; they rendered it as "to drink," making some sense of the line by filling out the parallelism "to eat [and drink]" (e.g., Eccl 8:15).<br>

However, an alternate textual tradition of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WNM#m!</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">m!M#NW</FONT>, "apart from him [= God]") is preserved in several medieval Hebrew MSS, and is reflected in most of the versions (LXX, Syriac, Syro-Hexapla, and Jerome). The textual deviation is a case of simple orthographic confusion between <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">y</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">w</FONT> as frequently happened, e.g., MT <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wxl wx wxl wx</FONT> versus 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yxl yx yxl yx</FONT> (Isa 28:10); see P. Kyle McCarter, Jr., <i>Textual Criticism: Recovering the Text of the Hebrew Bible</i>, 47). It is difficult to determine which reading is original here. The MT forms a parenthetical clause, where Qoheleth refers to himself: no one had more of an opportunity to experience more enjoyment in life than he (e.g., 2:1-11). The alternate textual tradition is a causal clause, explaining why the ability to enjoy life is a gift from God: no one can experience enjoyment in life "apart from him," that is, apart from "the hand of God" in 2:24. It is possible that internal evidence supports the alternate textual tradition. In 2:24-26, Qoheleth is not emphasizing his own resources to enjoy life, as he had done in 2:1-11; but that the ability to enjoy life is the gift of God. On the other hand, the Jerusalem Hebrew Bible project retains the MT reading with a "B" rating; see Dominique Barthelemy, ed. et al., <i>Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i> (New York: United Bible Society, 1979), 3.570. The English versions are split on the textual problem: a few retain MT <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yN]M#m!</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">m!M#N]</FONT>, "more than I"), e.g., KJV, ASV, YLT, Douay, NJPS, while others adopt the alternate reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WnM#m!</FONT> "<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">m!M#NW</FONT>, apart from him" (NEB, NAB, MLB, NASB, RSV, NRSV, NIV, Moffatt, AB).<br>

(2) Others refer it to the term "toil" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lmu</FONT>) which is repeated throughout 2:18-26. However, Qoheleth affirmed that if one is righteous, he can find enjoyment in his toil, even though so much of it is ultimately futile.

Consistent with the meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lb#h#</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">h#b#l</FONT>, "futile; profitless; fruitless"), 2:26b emphasizes that the "task" of the sinner is profitless: he labors hard to amass wealth, only to see the fruit of his labor given away to someone else.

Man does what God has willed, but man also does what he "pleases" (see note on the word "matter" in 3:1).<br>
 <a name="fn197" href="ecc.htm#fnB197"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:1)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tu</FONT> ("point in time") has a basic two-fold range of meanings: (1) "time of an event" and (2) "time for an event" (BDB 773). The latter has subcategories: (a) "usual time," (b) "the proper, suitable or appropriate time," (c) "the appointed time," and (d) "uncertain time" (Eccl 9:11). Here it connotes "a proper, suitable time for an event" (<i>HALOT </i>900 [6]; BDB 773 [2.b]). Examples: "the time for rain" (Ezra 10:13), "a time of judgment for the nations" (Ezek 30:3), "an appropriate time for every occasion" (Eccl 3:1), "the time when mountain goats are born" (Job 39:1), "the rain in its season" (Deut 11:14; Jer 5:24), "the time for the harvest" (Hos 2:11; Ps 1:3), "food in its season" (Ps 104:27), "no one knows his hour of destiny" (Eccl 9:12), "the right moment" (Eccl 8:5); cf. <i>HALOT </i>900 (6).<br>
 <a name="fn198" href="ecc.htm#fnB198"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:1)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jp#j@</FONT> (here "matter, business") has a broad range of meanings: (1) "delight; joy," (2) "desire; wish; longing," (3) "the good pleasure; will; purpose," (4) "precious stones" (i.e., jewelry), i.e., what someone takes delight in, and (5) "matter; business," as a metonymy of adjunct to what someone takes delight in (Eccl 3:1, 17; 5:7; 8:6; Isa 53:10; 58:3, 13; Pss 16:3; 111:2; Prov 31:13); see <i>HALOT </i>340 (4); BDB 343 (4). It is also sometimes used in reference to the "good pleasure" of God, that is, his sovereign plan, e.g., Judg 13:23; Isa 44:28; 46:10; 48:14 (BDB 343 [b.3]). While the theme of the sovereignty of God permeates Eccl 3:1-4:3, the content of 3:1-8 refers to human activities that are planned and purposed by man. The LXX translated it with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pragmati</FONT> ("matter"). The term is translated variously by modern English versions: "every purpose" (KJV, ASV, AB), "every event" (NASB), "every delight" (NASB margin), "every affair" (NAB), "every matter" (RSV, NRSV), "every activity" (NEB, NIV), "every project" (MLB), and "every experience" (NJPS).<br>

This is the declarative or delocutive-estimative sense of the Piel: "to view something as lost" (Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;145; <i>IBHS</i>, 403).<br>

This is a figurative description of man (metonymy of association), and plays on the repetition of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hcu</FONT> (verb: "to do," noun: "work") throughout the passage. In the light of God's sovereign immutable orchestration of human affairs, man's efforts cannot change anything. It refers to man in general with the article functioning in a generic sense (see <i>IBHS</i>, 244; Jo&uuml;on-Muraoka, <i>Grammar</i>, &#167;137.m).<br>

 <a name="fn207" href="ecc.htm#fnB207"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:11) <i>Heb</i> "darkness";  perhaps "eternity" or "the future."  The meaning of the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;l*u)</FONT> is debated.  It may mean: (1) "ignorance"; (2) time reference: (a) "eternity" or (b) "the future"; or (3) "knowledge" (less likely).  The arguments for these options may be summarized: (1) Most suggest that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;l*u)</FONT> is the defectively written form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;l*ou</FONT> "duration; eternity" (e.g., Eccl 1:4; 2:16; 3:14; 9:6; 12:5); see BDB 762 (2.k). Within this school of interpretation, there are several varieties: (a) BDB 762 (2.k) suggests that here it denotes "age [i.e., duration] of the world," which is attested in postbiblical Hebrew. The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;lu</FONT> III "eternity" = "world" (M. Jastrow, <i>Dictionary</i>, 1084) is used in this sense in postbiblical Hebrew, mostly in reference to the Messianic age, or the world to come (e.g., Targum Genesis 9:16; Targum Onqelos Exodus 21:6; Targum Psalms 61:7). For example, "the world [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;lu</FONT>] shall last six thousand years, and after one thousand years it shall be laid waste" (<i>b. Rosh HaShanah 31a</i>) and "the world [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;lu</FONT>] to come" (<i>b. Sotah 10b</i>). The LXX and the Vulgate took the term in this sense. This approach was also adopted by several English translations: "the world" (KJV, Douay, ASV margin). (b) <i>HALOT</i> 799 (5) and <i>THAT</i> 2.242 suggest that the term refers to an indefinite, unending future: "eternity future" or "enduring state referring to past and future" (see also BDB 762 [2.i]). In this sense, the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;lu</FONT> functions as a metonymy of association: "a sense of eternity," but not in a philosophical sense (see James Barr, <i>Biblical Words for Time</i>, 117 n. 4). This approach is supported by three factors: (i) the recurrence of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;l*ou</FONT> ("eternity") in 3:14, (ii) the temporal qualification of the statement in the parallel clause ("from beginning to end"), and (iii) by the ordinary meaning of the noun as "eternity" (<i>HALOT </i>798-799). The point would be that God has endowed man with an awareness of the extra-temporal significance of himself and his accomplishments (D. R. Glenn, "Ecclesiastes," <i>BKCOT</i>, 984). This is the most frequent approach among English versions: "the timeless" (NAB), "eternity" (RSV, MLB, ASV, NASB, NIV, NJPS), "a sense of time past and time future" (NEB), and "a sense of past and future" (NRSV). (3) Other scholars suggest that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;l*ou</FONT> simply refers to the indefinite future: "the future," that is, things to come (e.g., <i>HALOT </i>799 [2]; BDB 762 [2.a]; <i>THAT</i> 2.241). The plural <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ymlu</FONT> ("things to come") was used in this sense in Eccl 1:10 (e.g., 1 Kgs 8:13 = 2 Chr 6:2; Pss 61:5; 77:8; 145:13; Dan 9:24; cf. <i>HALOT </i>799 [2]). The point would simply be that God has not only ordained all the events that will take place in man's life (3:1-8), but also preoccupies man with the desire to discover what will happen in the future in terms of the orchestration or timing of these events in his life (3:9-11). This fits well with the description of God's orchestration of human events in their most appropriate time (3:1-10) and the ignorance of man concerning his future (3:11b). Elsewhere, Qoheleth emphasizes that man cannot learn what the future holds in store for him (e.g., 8:7, 17). This approach is only rarely adopted: "the future" (NJPS margin). (2) The second view is that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;lu</FONT> is not defectively written <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;l*ou</FONT> ("eternity") but the segholate noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;l#u#</FONT> II that means "dark" (literal) or "ignorance; obscurity; secrecy" (figurative). The related noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmlut</FONT> means "hidden thing; secret," and the related verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;lu</FONT> means "to hide; to conceal" (BDB 761; <i>HALOT </i>834-35). This is related to the Ugaritic noun "dark" and the Akkadian verb "to be black; to be dark" (see <i>HALOT</i> 834-35). In post-biblical Hebrew the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;l#u#</FONT> II means (i) "secret" and (ii) "forgetfulness" (M. Jastrow, <i>Dictionary</i>, 1084). Thus the verse would mean that God has "obscured" man's knowledge so that he cannot discover certain features of God's program. This approach is adopted by a few English translations: "ignorance" (AB) and "mystery" (Moffatt). Similarly, the term may mean "forgetfulness," that is, God has plagued man with "forgetfulness" so that he cannot understand what God has done from the beginning to the end (e.g., Eccl 1:11). (3) The third view (Delitzsch) is to relate <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;lu</FONT> to a cognate Arabic root meaning "knowledge." The point would be that God has endowed man with "knowledge," but not enough for man to discover God's eternal plan. This approach is only rarely adopted: "knowledge" (YLT).<br>
 <a name="fn208" href="ecc.htm#fnB208"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:11)  The Hebrew term translated <i>heart</i> functions as a metonymy of association for man's intellect, emotions, and will (BDB 524-25 [3-6, 9]). Here, it probably refers to man's intellectual capacities, as v. 11 suggests.<br>
 <a name="fn209" href="ecc.htm#fnB209"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:11)  The compound preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ylbm</FONT> (preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m</FONT> + negative particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ylb</FONT>) is used as a conjunction here. Elsewhere, it can express cause: "because there is no [or, is not]" (e.g., Deut 9:28; 28:55; Isa 5:13; Ezek 34:5; Lam 1:4; Hos 4:6), consequence: "so that there is no [or, is not]" (e.g., Ezek 14:5; Jer 2:15; 9:9-11; Zeph 3:6), or simple negation: "without" (e.g., Job 4:11, 20; 6:6; 24:7-8; 31:19). BDB 115 (3.c) suggests the negative consequence: "so that not," while <i>HALOT</i> 133 (5) suggests the simple negation: "without the possibility of."<br>
 <a name="fn210" href="ecc.htm#fnB210"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:11) <i>Heb </i>"the work that God has done." The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hcu-rva hcumh-ta</FONT> ("the work which he [i.e., God] has done") is an internal cognate accusative (direct object and verb are from the same root), used for emphasis (see <i>IBHS</i>, 167). The repetition of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hcu</FONT> ("he has done") in 3:11 and 3:14 suggests that this phrase refers to God's sovereign foreordination of all the events and timing of human affairs: God has "made" ( = "foreordained"; <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hcu</FONT>) everything appropriate in his sovereign timing (3:11a), and all that God has "done" ( = "foreordained"; <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hcu</FONT>) will come to pass (3:14). Thus, the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hcu</FONT> ("to do") functions as a metonymy of effect (i.e., God's actions) for cause (i.e., God's sovereign foreordination). The temporal clause "from beginning to end" (3:11) supports this nuance.<br>
 <a name="fn211" href="ecc.htm#fnB211"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:11)  Traditionally, "what God has done from the beginning to the end." The temporal clause <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[ws-duw varm</FONT> ("from the beginning to the end") is traditionally taken in reference to "eternity" (the traditional understanding of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;luh</FONT> earlier in the verse; see the note on "ignorance"), e.g., KJV, NEB, AB, NAB, ASV, NASB, NIV, RSV, NRSV. However, if <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;luh</FONT> simply denotes "the future" (e.g., <i>HALOT </i>799 [2]; BDB 762 [2.a]; <i>THAT</i> 2.241), this temporal clause would refer to the events God has ordained to transpire in an individual's life, from beginning to end. This approach is adopted by one English version: "but without man ever guessing, from first to last, all the things that God brings to pass" (NJPS). This would fit well in the context begun in 3:1 with the fourteen merisms encompassing man's life, starting with "a time to be born" (i.e., from the beginning in 3:11) and concluding with "a time to die" (i.e., to the end in 3:11). This is approach is also supported by the admonition of 3:12-13, namely, since no one knows what will happen to him in the future days of his life, Qoheleth recommends that man enjoy each day as a gift from God.<br>

There are several options: (1) God watches over the persecuted: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vqby</FONT> ("seeks") functions as a metonymy of cause for effect (i.e., to protect), and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[drn-ta</FONT> ("what is driven away") refers to "those who are persecuted." But this does not fit the context. However, this approach is adopted by one English version: "God seeks him who has been persecuted" (AB). (2) God will call the past to account: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vqby</FONT> ("seeks") functions as a metonymy of cause for effect (i.e., to hold accountable), and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[drn-ta</FONT> ("that which is driven away") is a metonymy of attribute (i.e., the past). This approach is adopted by several English translations: "God requires that which is past" (KJV), "God will call the past to account" (NIV) and "God summons each event back in its turn" (NEB). (3) God finds what has been lost: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vqby</FONT> ("seeks") functions as a metonymy of cause for effect (i.e., to find), and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[drn-ta</FONT> ("what is driven away") refers to what has been lost: "God restores what would otherwise be displaced" (NAB). (4) God repeats what has already occurred: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vqby</FONT> ("seeks") functions as a metonymy of effect (i.e., to repeat), and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[drn-ta</FONT> ("that which is driven away") is a metonymy (i.e., that which has occurred). This fits the context and provides a tight parallel with the preceding line: "That which is has already been, and that which will be has already been" (3:15a) parallels "God seeks [to repeat] that which has occurred [in the past]." This is the most popular approach among English versions: "God restores that which has past" (Douay), "God seeks again that which is passed away" (ASV), "God seeks what has passed by" (NASB), "God seeks what has been driven away" (RSV), "God seeks out what has passed by" (MLB), "God seeks out what has gone by" (NRSV), and "God is ever bringing back what disappears" (Moffatt).<br>

The meanings "to prove" (Qal), as well as "to cleanse; to polish" (Qal), "to keep clean" (Niphal), and "to cleanse" (<i>hiphal</i>) might suggest the meaning "to make clear" (Eaton 85-86). The meaning "to make clear; to prove" is well attested in post-biblical Mishnaic Hebrew (M. Jastrow, <i>Dictionary</i>, 197). For example, "they make the fact as clear (bright) as a new garment" (<i>b. Ketubbot 46a</i>) and "the claimant must offer clear evidence" (<i>b. Sanhedrin 23b</i>). The point would be that God allows human injustice to exist in the world in order to make it clear to mankind that they are essentially no better than the beasts. On the other hand, the LXX adopts the nuance "to judge," while Targum and Vulgate take the nuance "to purge; to purify." BDB 141 (4) suggests "to test, prove," while <i>HALOT</i> 163 (2) prefers "to select, choose."<br>

On the other hand, the shift from the perfect <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ytbvw</FONT> (<i>vav</i> + perfect 1cs from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwv</FONT> "to turn") to the preterite <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ha#r=a#w&#180;</FONT> (<i>vav</i> + Qal preterite 1cs from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">har</FONT> "to see") might indicate a purpose clause: "I turned [my mind] to consider." The preterite <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ha#r=a#w&#180;</FONT> (<i>vav</i> + Qal preterite 1cs from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">har</FONT> "to see") follows the perfect <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ytbvw</FONT> (<i>vav</i> + perfect 1cs from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwv</FONT> "to turn"). When a <i>wayyiqtul</i> form (<i>vav</i> + preterite) follows a perfect in reference to a past-time situation, the preterite also represents a past-time situation. Its aspect is based on the preceding perfect. In this context, the perfect and preterite may denote definite past or indefinite past action ("I turned and considered" as hendiadys for "I observed again" or "I repeatedly observed") or past telic action ("I turned [my mind] to consider"). See <i>IBHS</i>, 554-55.<br>
 <a name="fn231" href="ecc.htm#fnB231"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn </b> (4:1) <i>Heb </i>"all the oppressions" or "all the oppression"; alternately, "all the various kinds of oppression." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qvu</FONT> denotes "oppression," e.g., Jer 6:6; 22:17; Ezek 18:18; 22:7, 12, 29; Pss 73:8; 119:134 (see <i>HALOT </i>897 [1]; BDB 799 [1]). It occurs several times in the book, always in reference to personal rather than national oppression (4:1; 5:8 ET [5:7 HT]; 7:7). The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yqvuh</FONT> is plural and articular (<i>Heb</i> "the oppressions"). The article indicates a generic class ("oppression"). The plural may be classified in one of two ways: (1) a plural of number, which refers to specific kinds of oppression that occur on earth: "the various kinds of oppression"; (2) an abstract plural, which is used to refer to abstract concepts: "the oppression"; or (3) a plural of intensity, which describes the oppression at hand as particularly grievous: "awful oppression" or "severe oppression." The LXX renders it as a plural of number: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">sukofantia" </FONT>("oppressions"), as does the Vulgate. Most English versions treat it as a plural of number: "the oppressions" (KJV, ASV, AB, NAB, RSV, NRSV, MLB, YLT); however, a few treat it as an abstract plural: "the oppression" (NJPS, NIV, Moffatt).<br>
 <a name="fn232" href="ecc.htm#fnB232"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn </b> (4:1) <i>Heb </i>"is done." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ycun</FONT> (Niphal participle mpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hcu</FONT> "to do") is a probably a verbal use of the participle rather than a substantival use (NEB: "all the <i>acts</i> of oppression"). This verbal use of the participle depicts durative or universal gnomic action (see <i>IBHS</i>, 624). It emphasizes the lamentable continuity of oppression throughout human history. The English versions translate it variously: "[all the oppressions that] are done" (KJV, ASV, Douay, YLT), "[all the oppression] that goes on" (NJPS, Moffatt), "[all the oppressions] that are practiced" (AB, RSV, NRSV), "[all the oppressions] that occur" (MLB), "[all the acts of oppression] which were being done" (NASB), "[all the oppressions] that take place" (NAB), "[all the oppression] that was taking place" (NIV).<br>

The deitic particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnhw</FONT> ("and behold!") often occurs after verbs of perceiving, such as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">har</FONT> "to see" (e.g., Gen 19:28; 22:13; Exod 3:2; Lev 13:8). It introduces the content of what the character or speaker saw (<i>HALOT </i>252 [8]). It is used for rhetorical emphasis, to draw attention to the following statement (e.g., Gen 1:29; 17:20; Num 22:32; Job 1:19; cf. <i>HALOT </i>252 [5]). It often introduces something surprising or unexpected (e.g., Gen 29:6; Num 25:6; cf. <i>HALOT </i>252 [6]).<br>
 <a name="fn235" href="ecc.htm#fnB235"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:1)  The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yqvuh</FONT> (Qal passive participle mpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qvu</FONT> "to oppress") is a passive form, emphasizing that they are the objects of oppression at the hands of their oppressors. The participle functions substantivally, emphasizing the durative aspect of their condition and that this was the singular most characteristic attribute of this group of people: their lives were marked by oppression (see <i>IBHS</i>, 615).<br>

The singular noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">humd</FONT> ("tear") is used as a collective for "tears" (2 Kgs 20:5; Isa 16:9; 25:8; 38:5; Jer 8:23; 19:7; 13:17; 14:17; 31:16; Ezek 24:16; Mal 2:13; Pss 6:7; 39:13; 42:4; 56:9; 80:6; 116:8; 126:5; Lam 1:2; 2:18; Eccl 4:1); see <i>HALOT </i>227; BDB 199. It is often used in reference to lamentation over calamity, distress, or oppression (e.g., Ps 6:7; Lam 1:2; 2:11; Jer 9:17; 13:17; 14:17). The LXX translated it as singular <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dakroun</FONT> ("the tear"); however, the Vulgate treated it as a collective ("the tears"). Apart from the woodenly literal YLT ("the tear"), the major English versions render this as a collective: "the tears" or "tears" (KJV, ASV, NEB, AB, NAB, NASB, RSV, NRSV, NJPS, MLB, NIV). The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">humd</FONT> ("tears") functions as a metonymy of association for "weeping" (e.g., Isa 16:9; 8:23): "the oppressed [were weeping with] tears." The genitive-construct <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yqvuh tumd</FONT> (literally, "tear of the oppressed") is an objective genitive construction, that is, the oppressed are weeping. The singular <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tumd</FONT> ("tear") is used as a collective for "tears." This entire phrase, however, is still given a woodenly literal translation by most English versions: "the tears of the oppressed" (NEB, AB, NAB, ASV, NASB, RSV, NRSV, MLB, NIV, NJPS). Some paraphrases attempt to fill out the meaning, e.g., "the oppressed were in tears" (Moffatt).<br>

 <a name="fn239" href="ecc.htm#fnB239"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:2)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jbv</FONT> has a two-fold range of meaning: (1) "to praise; to laud"; and (2) "to congratulate" (KBL3 941; BDB 986). The LXX translated it as <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejphnesa</FONT> ("I praised"). The English versions reflect the range of possible meanings: "praised" (KJV, ASV, Douay); "congratulated" (AB, MLB, NASB); "declared/judged/accounted/thought...fortunate/happy" (NJPS, NEB, NIV, RSV, NRSV, NAB).<br>

Here, as in 9:6, it denotes "rivalry" (BDB 888 [1]) or "competitive spirit" (<i>HALOT</i> 1110 [1.b]). The LXX rendered it <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">zhlo"</FONT> ("envy; jealousy"). The English versions reflect this broad range: "rivalry" (NEB, NAB, NASB), "envy" (KJV, ASV, RSV, NRSV, MLB, NIV, NJPS), and "jealousy" (AB, Moffatt).<br>

 <a name="fn248" href="ecc.htm#fnB248"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn </b> (4:5) <i>Heb </i>"and eats his own flesh."

 <b>sn</b> (4:7)  This section is closely related to the preceding one: Qoheleth's observation of oppression (4:1-3) links back to his previous observation of oppression and injustice (3:16). It stands in stark contrast with his earlier statement in light of his admonition for man to enjoy life on earth as the reward for one's work (3:22). Now, Qoheleth turns his attention to consider the sorry fate of those who are not able to enjoy life on earth and their work because of oppression (4:1-3), over-obsessive competitiveness (4:4-6), and loneliness (4:7-12).<br>

The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ur /ynu</FONT> ("unhappy business; rotten business; grievous task") is used only in Ecclesiastes (1:13; 2:23, 26; 3:10; 4:8; 5:2, 13; 8:16). It is parallel with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lbh</FONT> ("futile") in 4:8, and describes a "grave misfortune" in 5:13. The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ynu</FONT> ("business") refers to something that keeps a person occupied or busy: "business; affair; task; occupation" (<i>HALOT </i>857; BDB 775).

The noun is from the Aramaic loanword <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">anynu</FONT> "concern; care." The verb is related to the Aramaic verb "to try hard," the Arabic verb "to be busily occupied; to worry; to be a matter of concern," and the Old South Arabic root "to be troubled; to strive with" (<i>HALOT </i>854). <i>HALOT</i> 857 renders the phrase as "unhappy business" here.

 <b>sn</b> (5:1)  The exhortation, "Guard your feet" is an idiom for "Watch your steps," i.e., "Be careful what you do."

The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">umvl</FONT> (preposition + Qal infinitive construct from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">umv</FONT> "to hear") may be taken in one of two ways: (1) literal: "to listen" in contrast to speak or (2) figurative (metonymy of cause for effect) "to obey" in contrast to sacrifice (KBL3 990-991; BDB 1033-34). The LXX took the term in the literal sense: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tou ajkouein</FONT> ("to listen"). The English versions reflect both literal and figurative options: "obedience" (NJPS, Douay, NAB, NEB, AB) versus "to hear [or, listen]" (KJV, ASV, YLT, MLB, RSV, NASB, NIV, NRSV). The section warns against rash vows therefore, the nuance "to listen" is more appropriate: the wise man will be slow to speak and quick to listen in the presence of God; however, the fool is unrestrained and speaks rashly.<br>

The term "sacrifice" functions as a synecdoche of general (i.e., sacrifice) for specific (i.e., vow offering).<br>

Contextually, the "sacrifice of fools" is a rash vow made to God that is not fulfilled. The rash vow is referred to in 5:2 as the "voice of a fool." Qoheleth admonishes the fool against making a rash vow that is not paid: "When you make a vow to God, do not delay in paying it; for God takes no pleasure in fools: Pay what you vow! It is better for you not to vow than to vow and not pay it" (vv. 4-5 [3-4 HT]).<br>

Here, it is used as a metonymy of cause (i.e., tasks) for effect (i.e., cares). The term is nuanced variously: (1) literal sense: "business" (KJV, ASV, YLT, NEB, RSV, AB) and "effort" (NASB), and (2) metonymical: "cares" (NAB, NIV, NRSV), "concerns" (MLB, Douay), "worries" (Moffatt) and "brooding" (NJPS).

The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rdn rdt</FONT> ("to vow a vow") is a Hebrew idiom in which the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rdn</FONT> is repeated for emphasis. The construction is a cognate accusative (see <i>IBHS</i>, 166). The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rdn</FONT> ("to vow") refers to the action of making a solemn promise to the LORD to perform an action or offer a sacrifice, e.g., Lev 27:8; Num 6:21; 30:11; Deut 23:23-24; Jonah 2:10; Mal 1:14; Pss 76:12; 132:2; see <i>HALOT </i>674. The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rdn</FONT> ("vow") was a gift or offering promised to be given to the LORD (Num 30:3; Deut 12:11; 23:19; Isa 19:12; Nah 2:1 [1:15]; Ps 61:6, 9); see <i>HALOT </i>674-75. It usually was a sacrifice or free-will offering (Deut 12:6; Ps 66:13) that was often promised during times of pressure (Judg 11:30; 1 Sam 1:11; 2 Sam 15:7-8; Pss 22:25; 66:13; 116:14, 18; Jonah 2:9). <br>

An Israelite was never required to make a vow, but once made, it had to be paid (Lev 22:18-25; 27:1-13; Num 15:2-10; Nah 1:15 [2:1 HT]).<br>

The textual problem was caused by orthographic confusion between similarly spelled words. The LXX might have been trying to make sense of a difficult expression.  The MT is preferred as the original.  All the major translations follow the MT except for Moffatt ("God").<br>
 <b>tn</b> (5:6)  <i>Heb</i> "the messenger." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ealm</FONT> ("messenger") refers to a temple priest (e.g., Mal 2:7; cf. <i>HALOT </i>585 [2.b]; BDB 521 [1.c]). The priests recorded what Israelite worshippers vowed (Lev 27:14-15). When an Israelite delayed in fulfilling a vow, a priest would remind him to pay what he had vowed. Although the traditional rabbinic view is that Qoheleth refers to an angelic superintendent over the temple, Rashi suggested that it is a temple-official. Translations reflect both views: "his representative" (NAB), "the temple messenger" (NIV), "the messenger" (AB, RSV, NRSV, NASB, MLB, NJPS), "the angel" (KJV, ASV, Douay) and "the angel of God" (NEB).<br>
 <a name="fn292" href="ecc.htm#fnB292"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:6)  The Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hggv</FONT> denotes "error; mistake" and refers to a sin of inadvertence or unintentional sin (e.g., Lev 4:2, 22, 27; 5:18; 22:14; Num 15:24-29; 35:11, 15; Josh 20:3, 9; Eccl 5:5; 10:5); see KBL3 948; BDB 993.

The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twmlh brb</FONT> is an adverbial modifier ("in many dreams"), as is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbrh &lt;yrbd</FONT> ("many words"). The <i>vav</i> prefixed to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrbdw</FONT> and the juxtaposition of the two lines suggests a comparison: "just as...so also..." (BDB 253 [1.j]). The English versions reflect a variety of approaches: "In the multitude of dreams and many words there are also diverse vanities" (KJV); "Through many empty dreams come many vows" (AB); "In the multitude of dreams there are vanities, and in many words" (ASV); "When dreams increase, empty words grow many" (RSV); "In many dreams and follies and many words" (MLB); "In the abundance of dreams both vanities and words abound" (YLT); "Where there are many dreams, there are many vanities, and words without number" (Douay); "Many dreams and words mean many a vain folly" (Moffatt); "Much dreaming leads to futility and to superfluous talk" (NJPS); "In many dreams and in many words there is emptiness" (NASB); "Much dreaming and many words are meaningless" (NIV); "With many dreams comes vanities and a multitude of words" (NRSV).<br>

The LXX understands the term as "oppression," as the translation <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">sukofantian</FONT> ("oppression") indicates. Likewise, <i>HALOT</i> 897 (1) classifies this usage as "oppression" against the poor. However, the context of 5:8-9 [7-8 HT] focuses on corrupt government officials robbing people of the fruit of their labor through extortion and the perversion of justice.<br>

 <a name="fn301" href="ecc.htm#fnB301"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:9)  The function of the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dbun</FONT> (Niphal participle ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dbu</FONT> "to serve") has been understood in four ways: (1) adjectival use of the participle, modifying the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hdc</FONT> ("field"): "cultivated field" (AB, RSV, NRSV, NJPS, NAB); (2) adjectival use of the participle, modifying <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Elm</FONT> ("king"): "the king who cultivates" (NASB); (3) verbal use of the participle, taking <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hdc</FONT> ("field") as the subject: "field is cultivated" (NEB); and (4) verbal use of the participle, taking <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Elm</FONT> ("king") as the subject: "the king is served" (KJV, NASB); also "the king profits" (NIV). BDB 713 (2) lists both the adjectival and verbal options: "a king for [i.e., devoted to] the cultivated field" and "a king that makes himself servant to the field [i.e., devoted to agriculture]." <i>HALOT</i> 774 suggests the line be rendered: "a king who serves the land." In the Qal stem the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dbu</FONT> is sometimes used in reference to tribute imposed upon a king's subjects (e.g., Jer 25:14; 27:7; 30:8; Ezek 34:27) and in reference to subjects serving a king (e.g., Judg 9:28, 38; 1 Sam 11:1; 1 Kgs 5:1; 2 Sam 22:44; Jer 27:7; 28:14; 2 Kgs 25:24); cf. BDB 713 (3); <i>HALOT </i>773 (3). Likewise, it is also used in reference to tilling the ground (e.g., Gen 2:5; 4:2, 12; 2 Sam 9:10; Isa 30:24; Jer 27:11; Zech 13:5; Prov 12:11; 28:19) and a vineyard or garden (Gen 2:15; Deut 28:39); cf. <i>HALOT </i>773 (1); BDB 713 (1).<br>
 <a name="fn302" href="ecc.htm#fnB302"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:9)  The syntax and exegesis of the line is difficult. There are three basic interpretive options: (1) the king takes care of the security of the cultivated land: "in any case, the advantage of a country is that there is a king for the cultivated land"; (2) the king is in favor of a prosperous agricultural policy: "in any case, the advantage of a country is that there is a king who is obeyed for the sake of the agriculture"; and (3) the king exploits the poor farmers: "the produce of the land is [seized] by all, even the king is served by the fields." Perhaps the best option in the light of the context is to take the referent of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lK{</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">K{l</FONT>, "all") to the government officials of 5:8 rather than to the people as a whole. The verse depicts the exploitation of the poor farmers by corrupt government officials. This is reflected in a few English versions: "the increase from the land is taken by all; the king himself profits from the fields" (NIV); "the profit of the land is among all of them; a cultivated field has a king" (RSV margin); and "the ruthless has an advantage in everything; he is king over the cultivated land" (AB). On the other hand, the LXX treated the syntax so the king is viewed in a neutral sense: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kai perisseia gh" ejpi panti ejsti, basileu" tou argou eijrgasmenou</FONT> ("The abundance of the earth is for everyone; the king is dependent on the tilled field"). Most English versions deal with the syntax so that the king is viewed in a neutral or positive sense: "the profit of the earth is for all; the king himself is served by the field" (KJV); "a king who cultivates the field is an advantage to the land" (NASB); "this is an advantage for a land: a king for a plowed field" (NRSV); "the greatest advantage in all the land is his: he controls a field that is cultivated" (NJPS); "a country prospers with a king who has control" (Moffatt); "a king devoted to the field is an advantage to the land" (MLB); "a king is an advantage to a land with cultivated fields" (RSV); "the best thing for a country is a king whose own lands are well tilled" (NEB); and "an advantage for a country in every respect is a king for the arable land" (NAB).

 <a name="fn322" href="ecc.htm#fnB322"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:18)  The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qlj</FONT> ("lot") has a wide range of meanings: (1) "share of booty" (Gen 14:24; Num 31:36; 1 Sam 30:24), (2) "portion of food" (Lev 6:10; Deut 18:8; Hab 1:16), (3) "portion [or, tract] of land" (Deut 10:9; 12:12; Josh 19:9), (4) "portion" or "possession" (Num 18:20; Deut 32:9), (5) "inheritance" (2 Kgs 9:10; Amos 7:4), (6) "portion" or "award" (Job 20:29; 27:13; 31:2; Isa 17:14) or "profit; reward" (Eccl 2:10, 21; 3:22; 5:17-18; 9:6, 9); see <i>HALOT </i>323; BDB 324. Throughout Ecclesiastes, the term is used in reference to man's temporal profit from his labor and his reward from God (e.g., Eccl 3:22; 9:9).<br>
 <a name="fn323" href="ecc.htm#fnB323"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:19)  The syntax of this verse is difficult. The best approach is to view <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wfylvh</FONT> ("he has given him the ability") as governing the three following infinitives: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lkal</FONT> ("to eat"), <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">taclw</FONT> ("and to lift" = "to accept [or, receive]") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jmclw</FONT> ("and to rejoice").

 <a name="fn324" href="ecc.htm#fnB324"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:19)  The feminine singular demonstrative pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hz)</FONT> ("this") refers back to all that preceded it in the verse (e.g., GKC &#167;135.<i>p</i>), that is, the ability to enjoy the fruit of one's labor is the gift of God (e.g., Eccl 2:24-26).<br>

The related noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ynu</FONT> ("business; occupation; task") refers to activity that keeps man busy and occupies his time, e.g., Eccl 1:13; 2:26; 3:10 (<i>HALOT </i>857; BDB 775).

(2) oppressiveness: "it lies heavy upon men" (RSV, NRSV), "it weighs heavily upon men" (NEB, NAB, NIV), "it presses heavily on men" (Moffatt), "it is heavy upon men" (ASV, AB), and "a grave one it is for man" (NJPS). The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu^</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u^l</FONT>, "upon") argues against the first in favor of the second; the notion of commonality would be denoted by the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B=</FONT> (<i>bet</i>, "among"). The singular noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;da</FONT> is used as a collective, denoting "men." The article on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;dah</FONT> is used in a generic sense referring to humankind as a whole; the generic article is often used with a collective singular (<i>IBHS</i>, 244).<br>

God must grant a person the ability to enjoy the fruit of his labor, otherwise a person will not be able to enjoy his possessions and wealth. The ability to partake of the fruit of one's labor and to find satisfaction and joy in it is a gift from God (e.g., Eccl 2:24-26; 3:13; 5:18 [19]; 9:7).<br>

The Hebrew expression <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yrkn ?ya</FONT> ("stranger") sometimes refers not to a foreigner or someone that the person does not know, but simply to someone else other than the subject (e.g., Prov 27:2). In the light of 6:3-6, it might even refer to the man's own heirs. The term is used as a synecdoche of species (foreigner for stranger) in the sense of someone else other than the subject: "someone else" (BDB 649 [3]).<br>

A person may be unable to enjoy the fruit of his/her labor due to an unfortunate turn of events that robs a person of his possessions (5:13-14) or a miserly, lifelong hoarding of one's wealth that robs him of the ability to enjoy what he has worked so hard to acquire (5:15-17). Qoheleth recommends the enjoyment of life and the fruit of one's labor, as God enables (5:18-20). Unfortunately, the ability to enjoy the fruits of one's labor is often thwarted by the obstacles described in 6:1-2 and 6:3-9.<br>

The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">htyh-al hrwbq-&lt;gw</FONT> ("he even has no burial") is traditionally treated as part of a description of the man's sorry final state, that is, he is deprived of even a proper burial (KJV, NEB, RSV, NRSV, AB, ASV, NASB, NIV, NJPS, MLB, Moffatt). However, the preceding parallel lines suggest that this a hyperbolic protasis: "If he were to live one hundred years...even if he were never buried [i.e., were to live forever]...." A similar idea occurs elsewhere (e.g., Pss 49:9; 89:48). See D. R. Glenn, "Ecclesiastes," <i>BKCOT</i>, 990.<br>

It affirms the fact that both the miserly rich man who lives two thousand years, as well as the stillborn who never lived one day, both go to the same place--the grave. And if the miserly rich man never enjoyed the fruit of his labor during his life, his fate was no better than that of the stillborn who never had opportunity to enjoy any of the blessings of life. In a sense, it would have been better for the miserly rich man to have never lived than to have experienced the toil, anxiety, and misery of accumulating his wealth, but never enjoying any of the fruits of his labor.<br>

The imagery of quick-burning thorns under a cooking pot is ambiguous and can be understood in more than one way: (1) It is useless to try to heat a cooking pot by burning quick-burning thorns because they burn out before the pot can be properly heated; (2) the heat produced by quick-burning thorns is fleeting--it produces quick heat, but lasts only for a moment. Likewise, the "laughter of a fool" can be taken in both ways: (1) In comparison to the sober reflection of the wise, the laughter of fools is morally useless: the burning of thorns, like the laughter of fools, makes a lot of noise but accomplishes nothing; (2) the laughter of fools is fleeting due to the brevity of life and certainty of death.

Scholars debate whether the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qvu</FONT> ("oppression; extortion") in this context denotes "oppression" (<i>HALOT </i>897 [1]) or "gain of extortion" (BDB 799 [3]). The parallelism between <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qvu</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hntm</FONT> ("bribe") seems to suggest the latter; but the prominence of the theme of oppression in 7:8-10 argues for the former. Elsewhere in Ecclesiastes, the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qvu</FONT> denotes "oppression" (Eccl 4:1) and "extortion" (Eccl 5:8 [Heb 5:7]). The LXX rendered it as <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">sukofantia </FONT>("oppression"). English translations are split between these two options: "extortion" (ASV, MLB, NIV), "oppression" (KJV, NAB, NASB, RSV, NRSV, YLT, Douay, Moffatt, AB), as well as "cheating" (NJPS) and "slander" (NEB).<br>

It has been handled variously: "deprives a wise man of reason" (Jastrow); "makes a wise man mad" (KJV, NASB, AB); "drives a wise man crazy" (NEB); "can make a fool of a wise man" (NAB); "makes the wise man foolish" (RSV, NRSV); and "turns a wise man into a fool" (NIV).<br>

BDB 767 (1) suggests the accompaniment nuance "together with," while <i>HALOT</i> 840 (2.c) suggests the comparative sense "in comparison to." The translations are also divided: "wisdom <i>with</i> an inheritance is good" (KJV, ASV margin, RSV, NASB, YLT, AB); "wisdom, <i>like</i> an inheritance, is a good thing" (NIV); "wisdom is <i>as good as</i> an inheritance" (ASV, NRSV, MLB, NJPS, Moffatt); "wisdom <i>is better than</i> an inheritance" (NEB). Because v. 12 compares wisdom with money (i.e., an inheritance), v. 11 is probably making a comparison as well: "Wisdom, like an inheritance, is good" (7:11a) = "Wisdom provides protection, just as money provides protection" (7:12a).

This approach is adopted by several translations: "wisdom is a defense, as money is a defense" (ASV), "wisdom is protection just as money is protection" (NASB), "wisdom like wealth is a defense" (Moffatt), "the protection of wisdom is as the protection of money" (NAB), "the protection of wisdom is like the protection of money" (RSV, NRSV), "wisdom protects as wealth protects" (MLB), and "wisdom is a shelter, as money is a shelter" (NIV).

Its parallelism with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lx</FONT> ("protection") indicates that it means "to preserve someone's life" from premature death or calamity.

It is derived from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rt#y\</FONT> ("what is left over"; cf. <i>HALOT </i>452), and related to the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rty</FONT> (Niphal "to be left over" and Hiphil "to have left over"; cf. <i>HALOT </i>451-52). In 2:15 the adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rt@oy</FONT> is used with the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ort=y]</FONT> ("advantage; profit") in a wordplay or pun: The wise man has a relative "advantage" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ort=y]</FONT>) over the fool (2:13-14a); however, there is no ultimate advantage because both share the same fate--death (2:14b-15a). Thus, Qoheleth's acquisition of tremendous wisdom (1:16; 2:9) was "excessive" because it exceeded its relative advantage over folly: it could not deliver him from the same fate as the fool. He strove to obtain wisdom, yet it held no ultimate advantage. Likewise, in 7:16, Qoheleth warns that wisdom and righteous behavior do not guarantee an advantage over wickedness and folly, because the law of retribution is sometimes violated.<br>

The Hitpael may be understood as: (1) benefactive reflexive use which refers to an action done for one's own behalf (e.g., Gen 20:7; Josh 9:12; 1 Kgs 8:33; Job 13:27): because the law of retribution is sometimes violated, it is not wise for a person to be overly dependent upon wisdom or righteousness for his own benefit; (2) estimative-declarative reflexive which denotes esteeming or presenting oneself in a certain state, without regard to the question of truthfulness (e.g., 2 Sam 13:5; Prov 13:6; Est 8:17): it is useless to overly esteem oneself as wise or to falsely present oneself as wiser than he really is because the law of retribution sometimes fails to reward the wise. The enigma of this line--"overly righteous and overly wise"--may be resolved by proper classification of the Hitpael stem of this verb.<br>

For its use here KBL3 989 (2) has "to cause oneself ruin"; BDB 1031 (2) has "cause oneself desolation, ruin." Most English versions take a similar approach: "Why destroy yourself?" (KJV, ASV, NEB, NRSV, MLB, NIV); "Why ruin yourself?" (AB, NAB, NASB). However, in the Hitpolel stem the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;mv</FONT> never means this elsewhere, but is always nuanced elsewhere as "to be appalled; to be astonished; to be dumbfounded; to be confounded; to be horrified" (e.g., Ps 143:4; Isa 59:16; 63:5; Dan 8:27); cf. BDB 1031 (1); KBL3 989 (1). It is taken this way in the English version of the Tanakh: "or you may be dumbfounded" (NJPS). Likewise, Cohen renders, "Why should you be overcome with amazement?" (A. Cohen, "Ecclesiastes," in <i>Soncino Books of the Bible</i> 14.154). If a person was trusting in his own righteousness or wisdom to guarantee prosperity, he might be scandalized by the exceptions to the doctrine of retribution that Qoheleth had observed in 7:15. D. R. Glenn ("Ecclesiastes," <i>BKCOT</i>, 994) notes: "This fits in nicely with Solomon's argument here. He urged his readers not to be over-righteous or over-wise `lest they be confounded or astonished.' He meant that they should not depend on their righteousness or wisdom to guarantee God's blessing because they might be confounded, dismayed, or disappointed like the righteous people whom Solomon had seen perishing in spite of their righteousness [in 7:15]."

 <a name="fn437" href="ecc.htm#fnB437"><sup>62</sup></a><b>tn </b> (7:18) The word "warning" does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is supplied in the translation two times in this line for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn438" href="ecc.htm#fnB438"><sup>63</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:18)  <i>The other warning</i>. Qoheleth is referring to the two words of advice in 7:16-17. He is not, as some suggest, urging his readers to grasp righteousness without letting go of wickedness. His point is not that people should live their lives with a balance of modest righteousness and modest wickedness. Because he urges the fear of God in 7:18b, he cannot be inconsistent in suggesting that his readers offend the fear of God by indulging in some degree of sin in order to counterbalance an overly righteous life. Rather, the proper fear of God will prevent a person from trusting in righteousness and wisdom alone for his security, and it will also prevent indulgence in wickedness and folly.<br>
 <a name="fn439" href="ecc.htm#fnB439"><sup>64</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:18)  Or "will escape both"; or "will go forth in both." The Hebrew phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;lk-ta</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">axy</FONT> ("he will follow both of them") has been interpreted in several ways: (1) To adopt a balanced lifestyle that is moderately righteous while allowing for self-indulgence in moderate wickedness ("to follow both of them," that is, to follow both righteousness and wickedness). However, this seems to unnecessarily encourage an antinomian rationalization of sin and moral compromise. (2) To avoid the two extremes of being over-righteous and over-wicked. This takes <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">axy</FONT> in the sense of "to escape," e.g., Gen 39:12, 15; 1 Sam 14:14; Jer 11:11; 48:9; cf. <i>HALOT </i>426 (6.c); BDB 423 (1.d): "He who fears God shall escape both of them" (so Delitzsch, Hitzig, Noldeke, and the Mishnah). (3) To follow both of the warnings given in 7:16-17. This approach finds parallels in post-biblical rabbinic literature denoting the action of discharging one's duty of obedience and complying with instruction. In post-biblical rabbinic literature the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ydy</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">axy</FONT> ("to go out of the hands") is an idiom meaning "to comply with the requirements of the law" (M. Jastrow, <i>Dictionary</i>, 587). This fits nicely with the context of 7:16-17 in which Qoheleth issued two warnings. In 7:18a Qoheleth exhorted his readers to follow both of his warnings: "It is best to grasp the first warning without letting go of the second warning." The person who fears God will heed both warnings. He will not depend upon his own righteousness and wisdom, but upon God's sovereign bestowal of blessings. Likewise, he will not exploit the exceptions to the doctrine of retribution to indulge in sin, rationalizing sin away just because the wicked sometimes do not get what they deserve.<br>

The MT reading is retained by most translations: "[And so I saw the wicked] buried, who had come and gone from the place [of the holy]" (KJV); "[Then I saw the wicked] buried; they used to go in and out of the [holy] place" (RSV, NRSV); "[I saw how the wicked] were buried, who had gone in and out from the [holy] place" (MLB); "[I have seen the wicked] buried, those who used to go in and out from the [holy] place" (NASB); "[Then too, I saw the wicked] buried--those who used to come and go from the [holy] place" (NIV); and "[And then I saw] scoundrels coming from the [Holy] Site and being brought to burial" (NJPS). (2) The LXX reflects the reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;wqmmw &lt;ya!b*Wm &lt;yr!b*q=</FONT> ("to the tombs they are brought, and from the place"). The LXX reflects the consonantal text of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrbq</FONT> but <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tafou"</FONT> ("tombs") reflects a vocalization tradition of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yr!b*q=</FONT> ("tombs"). This approach is adopted by several translations: "emmenes a leur tombeau, et...du lieu [saint]" (La Sainte Bible). (3) Several scholars suggest emending the text to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;wqmmw &lt;yabw &lt;yb rq</FONT> ("approaching and coming to the place"). The emendation involves <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yb! rq</FONT> (Qal active participle mpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">brq</FONT> "to approach; to draw near"). The emendation is adopted by several English versions: "I saw wicked men <i>approach</i> and enter...the sacred place" (NAB); "I saw wicked men <i>approaching </i>and even entering the holy place" (NEB). The emendation makes good sense because <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">brq</FONT> ("to approach; to draw near") is a synonym to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aob</FONT> ("to enter"), and is often used in reference to a person approaching the LORD at the tabernacle or temple. The textual corruption would be due to transposition of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">b</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">r</FONT> in <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">brq</FONT> ("to approach") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rbq</FONT> ("to bury").

 <a name="fn506" href="ecc.htm#fnB506"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tc</b> (8:10)  The MT reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wjktvyw</FONT> "and they were forgotten" (Hitpael imperfect 3mpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jkv</FONT> "to forget"). Apart from the MT reading here, the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jkv</FONT> "to forget" never  occurs elsewhere in the Hitpael (KBL3 969; BDB 987). Many medieval Hebrew MSS read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wjbtvyw</FONT> "and they boasted" (Hitpael imperfect 3ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jbv</FONT> "praise, boast"). This alternate textual tradition is reflected in the Greek versions, e.g., Old Greek: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kai ejphneqhsan</FONT> ("and they were praised"), Aquilla and Theodotion: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kai ejkauchsanto</FONT> ("and they boasted"), and Symmachus: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kai ejpainoumenoi</FONT> ("and they were praised"). This is also reflected in the Vulgate. The English versions are divided; several follow the MT and translate "they were forgotten" (KJV, ASV, NASB, MLB, NJPS), but a good number adopt the alternate textual tradition and translate either "they were praised" or "they boasted" (NEB, RSV, AB, NAB, NIV, NRSV). The context of 8:10-17, which focuses on the enigmatic contradictions in divine retribution (sometimes the wicked are not punished), favors the alternate tradition. The wicked boast that they can come and go as they please in the temple, flaunting their irreligion without fearing divine retribution (8:10). This thought is continued in v. 11: failure to execute a sentence against a criminal emboldens the wicked to commit more crimes, confident they will not suffer retribution. It is likely that the original reading of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wjbtvyw</FONT> was confused for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wjktvyw</FONT> because the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jbv</FONT> ("to praise; to boast") is much rarer than the common root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jkv</FONT> ("to forget"). The phrase is best rendered "they boasted" (NEB: "priding themselves") rather than "they were praised" (AB, NAB, RSV, NRSV, NIV)--the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jbv</FONT> means "to praise" in Piel, but "to boast" in Hitpael (Ps 106:47; 1 Chr 16:35) (KBL3 940-41; BDB 986). This approach is adopted by the committee for Jerusalem Hebrew Bible Project: see Dominique Barthelemy, ed. et al<i>., Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i> (New York: United Bible Society, 1976), 3:584-85.<br>
 <a name="fn507" href="ecc.htm#fnB507"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:10)  The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lbh</FONT> here means "enigmatic," that is, difficult to grasp (mentally). This sense is derived from the literal concept of breath, vapor or wind that cannot be seen; thus, the idea of "obscure, dark, difficult to understand, enigmatic" (see <i>HALOT </i>236-37; BDB 210-11; <i>TWAT</i> 2.334-43; <i>TDOT</i> 3.313-20; <i>THAT</i> 1.467-69; <i>TWOT</i> 1.204-05). It is used in this sense in reference to enigmas in life (6:2; 8:10, 14) and the future which is obscure (11:8, 10).<br>
 <a name="fn508" href="ecc.htm#fnB508"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:11)  The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> is used as a conjunction in a conditional/temporal clause to introduce the protasis ("when" or "if"), and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/k-lu</FONT> introduces the apodosis ("then"); cf.

 <a name="fn509" href="ecc.htm#fnB509"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:11)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;gtp</FONT> ("decision; announcement; edict; decree") is a loanword from Persian <i>patigama</i> (<i>HALOT </i>984; BDB 834). The Hebrew noun occurs twice in the OT (Eccl 8:11; Esth 1:20), twice in the Apocrypha (Sir 5:11; 8:9), and five times in Qumran (11QtgJob 9:2; 29:4; 30:1; 34:3; 1QapGen 22:27). The English versions consistently nuance this as a judicial sentence against a crime: "sentence" (KJV, NEB, AB, NAB, ASV, NASB, RSV, NRSV, MLB, YLT), "sentence for a crime" (NIV), "sentence imposed" (NJPS), "sentence on a crime" (Moffatt).<br>
 <a name="fn510" href="ecc.htm#fnB510"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:11) <i>Heb </i>"is not done." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hcu</FONT> ("to do") refers to a judicial sentence being carried out (<i>HALOT </i>892 [1]). The Niphal can denote "be executed; be carried out" of a sentence (Eccl 8:11) or royal decree (Est 9:1) (BDB 795 [1.a]). Similarly, the Qal can denote "to execute" vengeance (Judg 11:36) or judgment (1 Sam 28:18; Isa 48:14; Ezek 25:11; 28:26; Ps 149:7, 9) (BDB 794 [1.a]).<br>
 <a name="fn511" href="ecc.htm#fnB511"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:11) <i>Heb </i>"the heart of the sons of man." The singular noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bl</FONT> ("heart") is used collectively. The term "heart"(<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bl</FONT>) is often used figuratively (metonymy) in reference to inclinations and determinations of the will (BDB 525 [4]), moral character (BDB 525 [6]), and as a synecdoche for the man himself (BDB 525 [7]).<br>
 <a name="fn512" href="ecc.htm#fnB512"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:11) <i>Heb </i>"is full to do evil." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">alm</FONT> ("to fill") is used figuratively (metonymy): the lack of swift judicial punishment only emboldens the wicked to commit more crimes without fear of retribution. Most English versions translate the term literally: "are filled" (NIV, MLB, YLT), "is fully set" (KJV, ASV, RSV, NRSV), "is fully determined" (AB). However, several versions nuance it figuratively: "emboldened" (ASV, NJPS) and "boldly" (NEB). Moffatt renders the line, "Because sentence on a crime is not executed at once, the mind of man is prone to evil practices."<br>

Several English versions misconstrue the line: "he will not prolong his days, [which are] like a shadow" (KJV, ASV); "the man who does not fear God is like a shadow" (NEB); and "he will not prolong his shadowy days" (NAB). It should be rendered "he will not prolong his days like a shadow" (RSV, NRSV, AB, NASB, MLB, NIV). Unlike a shadow that lengthens at sunset, the wicked do not normally live long.<br>

In contrast to the other four pairs in v. 2 ("the righteous and the wicked," "those who sacrifice, and those who do not sacrifice," "the good man...the sinner," and "those who make vows...those who are afraid to make vows"), the MT has a triad in the second line: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">amflw rwhflw bwfl</FONT> ("the good, and the clean, and the unclean"). This reading in the Leningrad Codex (ca. A.D. 1008)--the basis of the <i>BHS</i> and <i>BHK</i> publications of the MT--is also supported by the Ben Asher text of the First Rabbinic Bible ("the Soncino Bible") published in A.D. 1488-94. On the other hand, the Greek version in B (Aquilla) has two pairs: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tw ajgaqw kai tw kakw, kai tw kaqarw kai tw ajkaqartw</FONT> ("the good and the bad, and the clean and the unclean"). Either Aquilla inserted <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kai tw kakw </FONT>("and the bad") to fill out a pair and to create six parallel pairs in v. 2, or Aquilla reflects an early Hebrew textual tradition of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">urlw bwfl</FONT> ("the good and the bad"). Since Aquilla is well known for his commitment to a literal--at times even a mechanically wooden--translation of the Hebrew, with no room for improvisation, it is more than likely that Aquilla is reflecting an authentic Hebrew textual tradition. Aquilla dates to A.D. 130, while the Leningrad Codex dates to A.D. 1008; therefore, the <i>Vorlage</i> of Aquilla might have been the original Hebrew textual tradition, being much earlier than the MT of the Leningrad Codex. The alternate textual tradition of Aquilla is also seen in the Syriac and Latin versions (but these are dependent upon the Greek = Aquilla). On the other hand, the editors of <i>BHK</i> and <i>BHS</i> suggest that the presence of the anomalous <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwfl</FONT> ("the good") was an addition to the Hebrew text, and should be deleted. They also suggest that the Greek pair <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tw ajgaqw kai tw kakw</FONT> ("the good and the bad") does not reflect an alternate textual tradition, but that their <i>Vorlage</i> contained only <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwfl</FONT> ("the good"): the Greek version intentionally added <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kai tw kakw</FONT> ("and the bad") to create a pair. The English versions are divided. Several follow the Greek: "the good and the bad, the clean and the unclean" (NEB, NAB, RSV, NRSV, NIV, Moffatt).

None, however, delete "the good" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwfl</FONT>) as suggested by the <i>BHK</i> and <i>BHS</i> editors. If the shorter text were original, the addition of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kai tw kakw</FONT> ("and the bad") would be intentional. If the longer text were original, the omission of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">urlw</FONT> ("and the bad") could have caused by unintentional homoioarcton ("similar beginning") in the three-fold repetition of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">fl</FONT> in <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">amflw rwhfl urlw bwfl</FONT> ("the good and the bad, the clean and the unclean").

 <a name="fn575" href="ecc.htm#fnB575"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:9)  As discussed in the note on the word "futile" in 1:2, the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lb#h#</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">h#b#l</FONT>) has a wide range of meanings, and should not be translated the same in every place (see <i>HALOT </i>236-37; BDB 210-11; <i>TWAT</i> 2.334-43; <i>TDOT</i> 3.313-20; <i>THAT</i> 1.467-69; <i>TWOT</i> 1.204-05). The term is used in two basic ways in OT, literally and figuratively. The literal, concrete sense is used in reference to the wind, man's transitory breath, evanescent vapor (Isa 57:13; Pss 62:10; 144:4; Prov 21:6; Job 7:16). In this sense, it is often a synonym for "breath; wind" (Eccl 1:14; Isa 57:13; Jer 10:14). The literal sense lent itself to the metaphorical sense. Because breath/vapor/wind is transitory and fleeting, the figurative connotation "fleeting; transitory" arose (e.g., Prov 31:30; Eccl 6:12; 7:15; 9:9; 11:10; Job 7:16). In this sense, it is parallel to "few days" and "[days] which he passes like a shadow" (Eccl 6:12). It is used in reference to youth and vigor (11:10) or life (6:12; 7:15; 9:9) which are "transitory" or "fleeting." In this context, the most appropriate meaning is "fleeting."<br>

It is used in parallelism with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/mz</FONT> ("appointed time; appointed hour") in 3:1 (<i>HALOT </i>273; BDB 273). Eccl 3:9-15 teaches God's sovereignty over the appointed time-table of human events. Similarly, Qoheleth here notes that no one knows what God has appointed in any situation or time.

This is an unusual form for a Pual participle: (1) The characteristic doubling of the middle consonant (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Q</FONT>) was omitted due to the lengthening of the preceding short vowel from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yv!Q*y|</FONT> to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yv!q*Wy</FONT> (GKC &#167;&#167;20.<i>n</i>, 52.<i>s</i>), and (2) The characteristic prefix <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">m=</FONT> is absent, as in a few other Pual participles, e.g., Exod 3:2; Judg 13:8; 2 Kgs 2:10; Isa 30:24; 54:11 (GKC &#167;52.<i>s</i>). On the other hand, the consonant form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;y?qwy</FONT> might actually be an example of the old Qal passive participle which dropped out of Hebrew at an early stage, and was frequently mistaken by the Masoretes as a Pual form (e.g., Jer 13:10; 23:32) (GKC &#167;52.<i>s</i>). Similarly, the Masoretes pointed <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lka</FONT> as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lK*a%</FONT> (Pual perfect 3ms "he was eaten"); however, it probably should be pointed <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lk^a%</FONT> (old Qal passive perfect 3ms "he was eaten") because <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lka</FONT> only occurs in the Qal (see <i>IBHS</i>, 373-74).<br>

The LXX uses subjunctives throughout vv. 14-15 to depict the scenario as a hypothetical situation: "Suppose there was a little city, and a few men [lived] in it; and there should come against it a great king, and surround it, and build great siege-works against it; and should find in it a poor wise man, and he should save the city through his wisdom; yet no man would remember that poor man."<br>

The literal meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rkz</FONT> ("to remember") in the following line harmonizes with the indicative: "but no one remembered that poor man [afterward]." However, the modal is supported by v. 16: "A poor man's wisdom is despised; no one ever listens to his advice." This approach must nuance <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rkz</FONT> ("to remember") as "[no one] listened to [that poor man]." Most translations favor the indicative approach: "he delivered" or "he saved" (KJV, RSV, NRSV, AB, NAB, ASV, NASB, MLB, NIV); however, some adopt the modal nuance: "he might have saved" (NEB, NJPS, NASB margin).<br>

The plural form of "flies" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ybwbz</FONT>) may be taken as a plural of number ("dead flies") or a distributive plural referring to one little fly ("one dead fly"). The parallelism supports the latter: "one little fly...so a little folly."<br>
 <a name="fn611" href="ecc.htm#fnB611"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:1)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vab</FONT> means "to cause to stink; to turn rancid; to emit a stinking odor" (e.g., Exod 16:24; Ps 38:6; Eccl 10:1); see <i>HALOT </i>107 (1); BDB 93. It is related to the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vaB=</FONT> "stench" (Isa 34:3; Joel 2:20; Amos 4:10); cf. <i>HALOT </i>107; BDB 93. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ubn</FONT> means "to ferment" or "to emit; to pour out; to bubble; to belch forth; to cause to gush forth" (<i>HALOT </i>665; BDB 615). The two terms <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">uyby vyaby</FONT> ("to stink" and "to ferment") create a hendiadys: a figurative expression in which two terms are used to connote one idea: "makes a rancid stench." Several versions treat this as a hendiadys (Old Greek, Symmachus, Targum, Vulgate); however, the Syriac treats them as separate verbs. Most translations treat these as a hendiadys: "Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savor" (KJV); "Dead flies make a perfumer's oil stink" (NASB); "dead flies give perfume a bad smell" (NIV); "Dead flies make the perfumer's ointment give off an evil odor" (RSV); Dead flies make the perfumer's ointment give off a foul odor" (NRSV); "Dead flies cause a perfumer's perfume to send forth a stink" (YLT); "Dead flies make the perfumer's ointment give off a foul odor" (NRSV). Others render both separately: "Dead flies make the perfumer's sweet ointment rancid and ferment" (NEB); "Dead flies turn the perfumer's ointment fetid and putrid" (NJPS). <br>
 <a name="fn612" href="ecc.htm#fnB612"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn </b> (10:1) <i>Heb </i>"carries more weight than"; or "is more precious than." The adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rqy</FONT> denotes "precious; valuable; costly" (<i>HALOT </i>432) or "weighty; influential" (BDB 430 [4]). The related verb denotes "to carry weight," that is, to be influential (<i>HALOT </i>432). The idea is not that a little folly is more valuable than much wisdom; but that a little folly can have more influence than great wisdom. It only takes one little mistake to ruin a life of great wisdom. The English versions understand it this way: "so a little foolishness is weightier than wisdom and honor" (NASB); "so a little folly outweighs massive wisdom" (NJPS); "so a little folly outweighs an abundance of wisdom" (MLB); "so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor" (RSV, NRSV, NIV); "so can a little folly make wisdom lose its worth" (NEB); "so a little folly annuls great wisdom" (ASV); "a single slip can ruin much that is good" (NAB); "so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honor" (KJV). The LXX rendered the line rather freely: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">timion ojligon sofiaj uJper doxan ajfrosunh" megalhn</FONT> ("a little wisdom is more precious than great glory of folly"). This does not accurately represent the Hebrew syntax.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (10:1)  Qoheleth creates a wordplay by using two Hebrew words for social honor or influence: "weighty" = honorable (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rqy</FONT>) and "heavy" = honor) (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dwbk</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn613" href="ecc.htm#fnB613"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:1)  The MT reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dwbkm hmkjm</FONT> ("more than wisdom, more than honor"), but several medieval Hebrew MSS read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dwbkmw hmkjm</FONT> ("more than wisdom and honor"). However the textual problem is resolved, the two nouns form a hendiadys: two terms joined by <i>vav</i> that describe one concept.  The first noun retains its full nominal sense, while the second functions adjectivally: "heavy wisdom" or better, "great wisdom."<br>
 <a name="fn614" href="ecc.htm#fnB614"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:2)  The phrase "right hand" is a Hebrew idiom for the place of protection (e.g., Pss 16:8; 110:5; 121:5). In ancient warfare, the shield of the warrior on one's right-hand side protected one's right hand. Qoheleth's point is that wisdom provides protection (e.g., Eccl 7:12).<br>
 <a name="fn615" href="ecc.htm#fnB615"><sup>7</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:2)  The fool lacks the protection of wisdom which is at the right-hand side of the wise man (see note on "right hand" in the previous line). The wise man's heart protects him, but the fool is always getting into trouble.<br>

It is used in reference to keeping one's composure in an emotionally charged situation (BDB 951 [2]). The term "calmness" is used here as a metonymy of association, meaning "calm response."<br>

The point is either that (1) a composed response can calm or appease the anger of the ruler, or (2) a calm heart will help one avoid great sins that would offend the king. The root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jWn</FONT> ("to rest") is repeated, creating a wordplay: "Do not leave" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jnt-la</FONT>) and "to avoid; to allay" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jyny</FONT>).

The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">run</FONT> has a wide range of meanings (<i>HALOT </i>707; BDB 654-55; <i>TWOT</i> 2.585-86). Used in reference to age, it may refer to an infant (Exod 2:6; Judg 13:5; 1 Sam 1:22; 4:21; 2 Sam 12:16), a child just weaned (1 Sam 1:24), an adolescent in puberty (1 Sam 16:11), or a young man of marriageable age (Gen 34:19; 2 Sam 14:21; 18:5, 12). Its technical or titular use denotes "servant" (Num 22:22; Judg 7:10-11; 19:3; 1 Sam 3:9; 2 Sam 16:1; 2 Kgs 4:12, 25; 19:6), "retainer; attendant; follower" (Gen 14:24; 1 Sam 25:5; 2 Sam 2:14; 2 Kgs 19:6; Isa 37:6; Job 1:15-17; Neh 4:10, 17) and "soldier" (1 Kgs 20:15-16). The parallel Ugaritic term is used in reference to physical age (lad; son; youth) and in a technical sense (guild members; servitors; soldiers); see UT 19.445. The LXX rendered it with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">newtero"</FONT> ("youthful"). The English versions vary: "child," (KJV, AB, ASV, NASB, MLB, RSV, NRSV margin, NIV margin); "childish" (NIV margin); "servant" or "slave" (NEB, NAB, ASV margin, NRSV, NIV); and "lackey" (NJPS). When used in reference to rulers, it emphasizes incompetence, naivet&eacute;, inexperience, and immaturity (Isa 3:4, 9; 1 Kgs 3:7). This use must be understood in the light of the parallel antonym: "son of freemen" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrwj-/b</FONT>). This suggests "servant," that is, one who was not well trained and prepared by noble birth to ascend to the throne.<br>

It is related to the Aramaic noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rrj</FONT> ("freeman"); Sabean <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rj</FONT> ("freeman; noble"); Old South Arabic <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rj</FONT> and Arabic <i>hurr</i> ("freedom"); cf. <i>HALOT </i>348; BDB 359.<br>
 <a name="fn658" href="ecc.htm#fnB658"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:17)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tu</FONT> ("point in time") has a basic two-fold range of meanings: (1) "time of an event" and (2) "time for an event" (BDB 773). The latter has four sub-categories: (a) "usual time," (b) "the proper, suitable or appropriate time," (c) "the appointed time," and (d) "uncertain time." Here it connotes "a proper, suitable time for an event" (<i>HALOT </i>900 [6]; BDB 773 [2.b]). Examples: "it was the time for rain" (Ezra 10:13); "a time of judgment for the nations" (Ezek 30:3); "there is an appropriate time for every occasion" (Eccl 3:1); "the rain in its season" (Deut 11:14; Jer 5:24); "the time for the harvest" (Hos 2:11; Ps 1:3); "food in its season" (Ps 104:27); "the right moment" (Eccl 8:5); cf. <i>HALOT </i>900 (6).<br>

According to <i>HALOT</i> 172 (1.d) the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrwbg</FONT> ("strength") may here connote "self-control." This tactic is adopted by a few English versions: "with self-control, and not as drunkards" (NEB) and "with restraint, not with guzzling" (NJPS). On the other hand, most English versions render <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ytvb alw hrwbg</FONT> in a woodenly literal sense, "for strength and not for drunkenness" (YLT, KJV, ASV, NASB, RSV, NRSV, NIV). However, a few attempt to express the idiom clearly: "as stalwarts and not as drunkards" (MLB); "stalwart men, not sots" (Moffatt); "as men and not as sots" (AB); "for vigor and not in drinking bouts" (NAB); "for refreshment, and not for riotousness" (Douay).<br>

BDB 537 (1.a) suggests that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;jl hycu</FONT> in Eccl 10:19 means "make a feast." This obscure line has occasioned numerous proposals: "a feast is made for laughter" (KJV, ASV, NIV); "feasts are made for laughter" (NRSV); "men feast for merrymaking" (Moffatt); "men prepare a meal for enjoyment" (NASB); "the table has its pleasures" (NEB); "they [i.e., rulers of v. 16] make a banquet for revelry" (NJPS); "people prepare a banquet for enjoyment" (MLB); "for laughter they make bread and wine, that the living may feast" (Douay); "bread is made for laughter" (RSV); "with mirth they make bread" (AB); "bread [and oil] call forth merriment" (NAB).<br>

The term is traditionally rendered here as "cast" (KJV, AB, NAB, RES, ASV, NASB, NIV); however, some render it "send" (NJPS, NRSV, NEB).

The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;jl</FONT> is traditionally rendered "bread" (KJV, AB, NAB, RSV, NRSV, ASV, NASB, NIV, NJPS). However, 11:1-2 seems to deal with exporting goods overseas (D.

It is better to take <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;jl</FONT> ("bread") as a metonymy of product, standing for the grain and wheat from which bread is produced (e.g., Gen 41:54-55; 47:13, 15, 17, 19; 49:20; Num 15:19; 2 Kgs 18:32; Isa 28:28; 30:23; 36:17; 55:10; Jer 5:17; Ezek 48:18; Job 28:5; Ps 104:14; Prov 28:3); see <i>HALOT</i> 526 (1); BDB 537 (1.b). It is taken this way by several translations: "grain" (NEB) and "goods" (Moffatt). Qoheleth encouraged the export of grain products overseas in international trade.<br>
 <a name="fn674" href="ecc.htm#fnB674"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn </b> (11:1) <i>Heb </i>"upon the surface of the waters." This is traditionally viewed as extolling generosity from which a reward will be reaped. On the other hand, some scholars suggest that the imagery deals with commercial business through maritime trade. Jastrow took this verse as advice to take risks in business by trusting one's goods or ships that will after many days return with a profit (Cohen, <i>Soncino Bible</i>, 12.181). Sea trade was risky in the ancient Near East, but it brought big returns to its investors (e.g., 1 Kgs 9:26-28; 10:22; Ps 107:23); see D. R. Glenn, "Ecclesiastes," <i>BKCOT</i>, 1002-3. The verse is rendered thus: "Send your grain across the seas, and in time you will get a return" (NEB); or "Trust your goods far and wide at sea, till you get a good return after a while" (Moffatt).<br>

 <a name="fn677" href="ecc.htm#fnB677"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:2)  The phrase "seven or eight" is a graded numerical saying depicting an indefinite plurality: "The collocation of a numeral with the next above it is a rhetorical device employed in numerical sayings to express a number, which need not, or cannot, be more exactly specified. It must be gathered from the context whether such formulae are intended to denote only an insignificant number (e.g., Is 17:6 "two" or at the most "three") or a considerable number (e.g., Mi 5:4). Sometimes, however, this juxtaposition serves to express merely an indefinite total, without the collateral idea of intensifying the lower by means of the higher number" (GKC &#167;134.<i>s</i>). Examples: "one" or "two" (Deu 32:30; Jer 3:14; Job 33:14; 40:5; Ps 62:12); "two" or "three" (2 Kgs 9:32; Isa 17:6; Hos 6:2; Amos 4:8; Sir 23:16; 26:28; 50:25); "three" or "four" (Jer 36:23; Amos 1:3-11; Prov 21:19; 30:15, 18; Sir 26:5); "four" or "five" (Isa 17:6); "six" or "seven" (Job 5:19; Prov 6:16); "seven" or "eight" (Mic 5:4; Eccl 11:2).<br>
 <a name="fn678" href="ecc.htm#fnB678"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:2)  This line is traditionally understood as an exhortation to be generous to a multitude of people (KJV, AB, NAB, ASV, NASB, RSV, NRSV, NIV, NJPS); however, it is better taken an shrewd advice to not commit all one's possessions to a single venture (Cohen, <i>Soncino Bible</i>, 12.181). D. R. Glenn ("Ecclesiastes," <i>BKCOT</i>, 1003) writes: "In view of the possibility of disaster, a person should make prudent investments in numerous ventures rather than put all his `eggs in one basket' (e.g., Gen 32:7-8 for a practical example of this advice)." Several translations reflect this: "Divide your merchandise among seven ventures, eight maybe" (NEB); "Take shares in several ventures" (Moffatt).<br>

The LXX understood it as the wind: "the way of the wind" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJ oJdo" tou pneumato"</FONT>); however, the Targum and Vulgate take it as the human spirit. The English versions are divided: (1) spirit: "the way of the spirit" (KJV, YLT, Douay); "the breath of life" (NAB); "what the way of the spirit is into the bones in the pregnant womb" (AB); "how a pregnant woman comes to have...a living spirit in her womb" (NEB); "how the lifebreath passess into the limbs within the womb of the pregnant woman" (NJPS); "how the spirit comes to the bones in the womb of a woman with child" (RSV); "how the breath comes to the bones in the mother's womb" (NRSV); and (2) wind: "the way of the wind" (ASV, RSV margin); "the path of the wind" (NASB, NIV); and "how the wind blows" (MLB, Moffatt).<br>

Several English versions capture the sense of the idiom well: "do not stop working" (NEB); "give your hand no rest" (AB); "do not be idle" (MLB); "let not your hand be idle" (NAB); "let not your hands be idle" (NIV); "stay not your hand" (Moffatt). The term "hand" is a synecdoche of part (i.e., do not let your hand rest) for the whole person (i.e., do not allow yourself to stop working).<br>

 <a name="fn692" href="ecc.htm#fnB692"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn </b> (11:7) <i>Heb </i>"the eyes." The term "eyes" is a synecdoche of part (i.e., eyes) for the whole person. Used with the idiom "to see the sun" (i.e., to be alive), Qoheleth is simply saying that the experience of a life is a pleasant thing that should be savored.<br>
 <a name="fn693" href="ecc.htm#fnB693"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:7)  The idiom "to see the sun" (both <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vmvh har</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vmvh hzj</FONT>) is an idiom meaning "to be alive" (e.g., Ps 58:9; Eccl. 6:5; 7:11; 11:7); cf. BDB 1039 (4.b). The opposite idiom, "the sun is darkened," refers to the onset of old age and death (Eccl 12:2).<br>

Elsewhere, "darkness" is a figure of speech (metonymy of association) for death (Job 10:21-22; 17:13; 18:18).<br>

This sense is derived from the literal concept of breath, vapor or wind that cannot be seen; thus, the idea of "obscure; dark; difficult to understand; enigmatic" (see <i>HALOT </i>236-37; BDB 210-11; <i>TWAT</i> 2.334-43; <i>TDOT</i> 3.313-20; <i>THAT</i> 1.467-69; <i>TWOT</i> 1.204-05). It is used in this sense in reference to enigmas in life (6:2; 8:10, 14) and the future which is obscure (11:8).<br>

Here, it is used figuratively (hypocatastasis) of the emotional/psychological action of banishing unnecessary emotional stress from one's mind. The Hiphil usage means "to remove; to abolish; to keep away; to turn away; to push aside" (<i>HALOT </i>748 [1]). The English versions render this term in a variety of ways, none of which is very poetic: "remove" (KJV, RSV, ASV, NASB); "turn aside" (YLT); "put away" (AB); "ward off" (NAB); and "banish" (NEB, MLB, NIV, NRSV, NJPS, Moffatt).<br>

This sense is best captured as "pain" (NASB, RSV, NRSV, MLB, Moffatt) or "the troubles [of your body]" (NEB, NIV), rather than "evil" (KJV, AB, ASV, YLT, Douay) or "sorrow" (NJPS).<br>

This would be a figure (metonymy of association) for youthfulness. On the other hand, if the term is from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rjv</FONT> II ("dawn"), it connotes the "dawn of life" or "prime of life" (KBL3 962; BDB 1007). This would be a figure (hypocatastasis) for youthfulness. In either case, the term is a figure for "youth" or "prime of life," as the parallel term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twdlyh</FONT> ("youth" or "childhood") indicates. The term is rendered variously in the English versions: "black hair" (NJPS); "the dawn of youth" (NAB); "the dawn of life" (ASV, MLB, RSV, NRSV); "the prime of life" (NEB, AB, NASB); "vigor" (NIV); "youth" (KJV); and "manhood" (Moffatt). The plural forms of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twrjvh</FONT> ("youth") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twdlyh</FONT> ("childhood") are examples of the plural of state or condition that a person experiences for a temporary period of time, e.g., <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ynqz</FONT> ("old age"); <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrwun</FONT> ("youth"); and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ymwlu</FONT> ("youthfulness"); see <i>IBHS</i>, 121.<br>

This nuance is suggested here by the collocation of "youth" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twdlyh</FONT>) and "the prime of life" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twrjvh</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn707" href="ecc.htm#fnB707"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:1)  The imperative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rkz</FONT> ("Remember!") is a figurative expression (metonymy of association) for obeying God and acknowledging his lordship over one's life (e.g., Num 15:40; Deut 8:18; Pss 42:6-7; 63:6-8; 78:42; 103:18; 106:7; 119:52, 55; Jer 51:50; Ezek 20:43; Jonah 2:7; Mal 4:4). The exhortation to fear God and obey his commands in 12:13-14 spells out what it means to "remember" God.<br>
 <a name="fn708" href="ecc.htm#fnB708"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:1)  The temporal adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">du</FONT> ("before") is repeated three times in 12:1-7 (vv. 1b, 2a, 6a). Likewise, the temporal preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">b</FONT> ("when") is repeated twice (vv. 3a, 4b). These seven verses comprise one long sentence in Hebrew: the main clause is 12:1a ("Remember your Creator in the days of your youth"), while 12:1b-7 consists of five subordinate temporal clauses ("before...before...when...when...before...").<br>
 <a name="fn709" href="ecc.htm#fnB709"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:1)  The adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hur</FONT> ("evil") does not refer here to ethical evil, but to physical difficulty, injury, pain, deprivation and suffering (e.g., Deut 31:17, 21; 32:23; 1 Sam 10:19; Neh 1:3; 2:17; Pss 34:20; 40:13; 88:4; 107:26; Eccl 11:10; Jer 2:27; Lam 3:38); see <i>HALOT </i>1263 (4.c); BDB 949 (2). <br>
 <a name="fn710" href="ecc.htm#fnB710"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn </b> (12:2) <i>Heb </i>"the light and the moon and the stars." The phrase "the light and the moon" is a hendiadys (two separate terms denoting one idea) or perhaps even a hendiatrys (three separate terms denoting one idea) for "the light of the moon and stars" (e.g., Gen 1:14).<br>
 <a name="fn711" href="ecc.htm#fnB711"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:2)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwv</FONT> ("to return") here denotes "to desist" (KBL3 952 [2]). It pictures the disappearance of the clouds as a result of the precipitation of their contents.<br>

 <a name="fn713" href="ecc.htm#fnB713"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:3)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">uwz</FONT> ("to tremble") probably does not refer to physical tremors but to trembling in fear (e.g., Esth 5:9; Hab 2:7; Sir 48:12); cf. <i>HALOT </i>267). At the onset of old age, those who had been the most courageous during their youth suddenly become fearful.<br>
 <a name="fn714" href="ecc.htm#fnB714"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:3)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twu</FONT> ("to bend; to stoop") means "to be stooped" (<i>HALOT </i>804) rather than "to bend themselves" (BDB 736). The perfect tense may be taken in an ingressive sense ("begin to stoop over") or in a durative, iterative sense ("are continually stooped over").<br>
 <a name="fn715" href="ecc.htm#fnB715"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:3)  The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twnjfh</FONT> (Qal active participle fpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/jf</FONT> "to grind") is a double entendre. In its literal sense, it refers to female mill-grinders; in its figurative sense, it refers to molar teeth (<i>HALOT </i>374). The related Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnjf</FONT> refers to a "mill," and the related Arabic noun <i>tahinat</i> means "molar tooth" (<i>HALOT </i>374).<br>
 <a name="fn716" href="ecc.htm#fnB716"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:3)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">i?j</FONT> ("to grow dim") is used elsewhere in reference to failing eyesight (e.g., Ps 69:24; Lam 5:17); see <i>HALOT </i>361 (2). Therefore, the phrase "those who look through the windows" is probably a figurative description of the eyes, picturing failing eyesight at the onset of old age.<br>
 <a name="fn717" href="ecc.htm#fnB717"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:4)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnjf</FONT> refers to a "grinding-mill" where grain is ground into flour (<i>HALOT </i>374). The term is here used as a double entendre, figuratively describing the loss of one's teeth at the onset of old age. The figurative usage also draws upon the polysemantic nature of this noun; the related Arabic root <i>tahinat</i> means "molar tooth" (<i>HALOT </i>374).<br>
 <a name="fn718" href="ecc.htm#fnB718"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn </b> (12:4) <i>Heb </i>"rises up." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;wq</FONT> ("to arise") refers to being awakened from sleep in the middle of the night by a sound (e.g., Exod 12:30; 1 Sam 3:6, 8) and awaking up early in the morning (e.g., Gen 24:54; Judg 16:3; Ruth 3:14; Neh 2:12; Job 14:12; 24:14); see <i>HALOT </i>1086 (1); BDB 877 (1.a). Here it describes one of the frustrations of old age: the elderly person is unable to get a full night's sleep because every little sound awakens him in the middle of the night or too early in the morning.<br>
 <a name="fn719" href="ecc.htm#fnB719"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:4)  The term "their" does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is supplied in the translation for clarity and smoothness.<br>
 <a name="fn720" href="ecc.htm#fnB720"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn </b> (12:4) <i>Heb </i>"all the daughters of song." The expression "the daughters of song" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ryvh twnb</FONT>) is an idiom for "songs; musical sounds; melodious notes" (<i>HALOT </i>166 [2]; BDB 123 [5]; GKC &#167;127.<i>v</i>). The genitive <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ryvh</FONT> ("song") represents the nature, quality, character or condition of the construct <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twnb</FONT> ("daughters"); see <i>IBHS</i>, 149-50. The idiom refers to the musical songs sung during one's youth or to the ability to hear songs that are sung. This line is lamenting the loss of hearing which occurs at the onset of old age.<br>

 <a name="fn722" href="ecc.htm#fnB722"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:5)  The Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ytjtj</FONT> literally means "terrors" (<i>HALOT </i>363; BDB 369). Here it is used as a metonymy (cause for effect) to refer to dangers that cause the elderly to be fearful of going outside or walking along the streets. The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tjtj</FONT> ("terror") is a reduplicated noun stem from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ttj</FONT> ("terror"); <i>HALOT </i>363; BDB 369; BL 482 (d). The reduplication of the noun stem intensifies its meaning: the root noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ttj</FONT> means "terror," so the intensified reduplicated form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tjtj</FONT> connotes something like "great terror" (see Sabatino Moscati, <i>Comparative Grammar of the Semitic Languages</i>, 12.9-13). The plural form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ytjtj</FONT> ("great terrors") denotes plural of number (more than one) or plural of intensity (which would further intensify the experience of fear); see <i>IBHS</i>, 122-24.<br>
 <a name="fn723" href="ecc.htm#fnB723"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:5)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dqv</FONT> is used in the OT in reference to the "almond nut" (e.g., Gen 43:11; Num 17:23) and metonymically (product for thing producing it) for the "almond tree" (e.g., Jer 1:11); cf.

 <a name="fn724" href="ecc.htm#fnB724"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:5)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jxn</FONT> ("to blossom") is a geminate verb (II = III) that, in this case, is written with a <i>matres lectionis</i> (plene spelling) rather than the normal spelling of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jnyw</FONT> (GKC &#167;73.<i>g</i>). The Hiphil verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Janyw</FONT> is from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jxn</FONT> "to shine; to sparkle; to blossom" (<i>HALOT </i>717; BDB 665). It is used in reference to almond blossoms whose color progresses from pink to white as they ripen (e.g., Song 6:11). This is an appropriate metaphor (comparison of sight) to describe white hair that often accompanies the onset of old age.<br>

It refers to the <i>Capparis spinosa</i> fruit which was eaten as an aphrodisiac in the ancient Near East (<i>HALOT </i>5; BDB 2-3). There are two options for the interpretation of this figure: (1) At the onset of old age, the sexual virility that marked one's youth is nothing more than a distant memory, and even aphrodisiacs fail to stimulate sexual desire to allow for sexual intercourse. (2) The onset of old age is like the shriveling up of the caper berry fruit; the once virile youth has passed his prime just like a shriveled caper berry can no longer provide a sexual stimulant. <br>

 <a name="fn729" href="ecc.htm#fnB729"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:5)  In the construct phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wmlwu tyb</FONT> ("house of his eternity"), the genitive <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;lwu</FONT> ("eternity") functions as an attributive adjective: "his eternal home." This is an idiom for the grave as the resting place of the body (e.g., Ps 49:12 [11]; Job 7:9; 14:10-12; Eccl 12:5) or Sheol as the residence of the dead (e.g., Job 17:13; 30:23); see <i>HALOT </i>124 (2); 799 (5); BDB 109 (1.d). For example, the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tyb</FONT> ("house") is used in Job 30:23 in parallelism with "death" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twm</FONT>). The same idiom appears in post-biblical Hebrew: "the house of eternity" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;lu tyb</FONT>) is a euphemism for burial ground or cemetery (Lam. Rab. 1:5; Lev. Rab. s. 12); see M. Jastrow, <i>Dictionary</i>, 1085. This idiom is also found in a Moabite text in reference to the grave (Deir Alla Inscription 2:6). A similar idiom is found in Phoenician and Palmyrene in reference to the grave (DISO 35). The idiom appears to have originated in Egyptian literature (<i>TDOT</i> 2.113). See F.

This Hebrew noun is related to the Akkadian term <i>gulgullu</i> ("pot"), as well as Phoenician <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lglg</FONT> ("wheel for drawing water").

This is particularly true of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lK)h^</FONT> (BDB 482 [2.b]) in which the article particularizes or limits the referent to the contextual or previously mentioned topic (e.g., Gen 16:12; 24:1; Exod 29:24; Lev 1:9, 13; 8:27; Deut 2:36; Josh 11:19 [see 2 Sam 19:31; 1 Kgs 14:26 = 2 Chr 12:9]; 21:43; 1 Sam 30:19; 2 Sam 17:3; 23:5; 24:23; 1 Kgs 6:18; 2 Kgs 24:16; Isa 29:11; 65:8; Jer 13:7, 10; Ezek 7:14; Pss 14:3; 49:18; 1 Chr 7:5; 28:19; 29:19; 2 Chr 28:6; 29:28; 31:5; 35:7; 36:17-18; Ezra 1:11; 2:42; 8:34-35; 10:17; Eccl 5:8). Thus, "all" does not always mean "all" absolutely or universally in comprehension. In several cases the context limits its reference to two classes of objects/issues being discussed, so <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lK)h^</FONT> means "both" (e.g., 2:14; 3:19: 9:1, 2). Thus, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lK)h^</FONT> ("all; everything") refers only to what Qoheleth characterizes as "futile" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lb#h#</FONT>) in the context. This does not mean that everything is futile. For example, fearing God is not "futile" (2:26; 3:14-15; 11:9-10; 12:1, 9, 13-14). Only those objects/issues that are contextually placed under <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lK)</FONT> are designated as "futile" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lb#h#</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn735" href="ecc.htm#fnB735"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:8)  The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lb#h#</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">h#b#l</FONT>, "futile") is repeated three times within the six words of this verse for emphasis. The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lbh</FONT> ("futile") is the key word in Ecclesiastes. The root is used in two ways in the OT, literally and figuratively. The literal, concrete sense is used in reference to the wind, man's transitory breath, evanescent vapor (Isa 57:13; Pss 62:10; 144:4; Prov 21:6; Job 7:16). In this sense, it is often a synonym for "breath; wind" (Eccl 1:14; Isa 57:13; Jer 10:14). The literal sense lent itself to metaphorical senses: (1) breath/vapor/wind is non-physical, evanescent, and lacks concrete substance thus, the connotation "unsubstantial" (Jer 10:15; 16:19; 51:18), "profitless; fruitless" (Ps 78:33; Prov 13:11), "worthless" (2 Kgs 17:15; Jer 2:5; 10:3), "pointless" (Prov 21:6), "futile" (Lam 4:17; Eccl 1:2, 14; 2:1, 14-15); (2) breath/vapor/wind is transitory and fleeting--thus, the connotation "fleeting; transitory" (Prov 31:30; Eccl 6:12; 7:15; 9:9; 11:10; Job 7:16) and (3) breath/vapor/wind cannot be seen thus, the idea of "obscure; dark; difficult to understand; enigmatic" (Eccl 11:10); see <i>HALOT </i>236-37; BDB 210-11; <i>TWAT</i> 2.334-43; <i>TDOT</i> 3.313-20; <i>THAT</i> 1.467-69; <i>TWOT</i> 1.204-05. The metaphorical sense is used with the following synonyms: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WhT)</FONT> ("empty," "vanity"; Isa 49:4), <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qyr!</FONT> ("profitless," "useless"; Isa 30:7; Eccl 6:11), and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lyu!oh aO</FONT> ("worthless," "profitless"; Is 30:6; 57:12; Jer 16:19). It is parallel to "few days" and "[days] which he passes like a shadow" (Eccl 6:12). It is used in reference to youth and vigor (11:10) and life (6:12; 7:15; 9:9) which are "transitory" or "fleeting." The most common parallels to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lbh</FONT> in Ecclesiastes are the phrases "chasing after the wind" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jwr twur</FONT>) (2:11, 17, 26; 7:14) and "what profit?" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/wrty-hm</FONT>) or "no profit" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/wrty /ya</FONT>); e.g., 2:11; 3:19; 6:9, 19. It is used in reference to enigmas in life (6:2; 8:10, 14) and to the future which is obscure (11:8). It is often used in antithesis to terms connoting value: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bof</FONT> ("good, benefit, advantage") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ort=y]</FONT> ("profit, advantage, gain"). Because the concrete picture of the "wind" lends itself to the figurative connotation "futile," the motto "This is futile" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lb#h# hz#</FONT>) is often used with the metaphor, "like striving after the wind" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">j^Wr tWur=</FONT>)--a graphic picture of an expenditure of effort in vain because no one can catch the wind by chasing it (e.g., 1:14, 17; 2:11, 17, 26; 4:4, 6, 16; 6:9). Although it is the key word in Ecclesiastes, it should not be translated the same way in every place.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (12:8)  <i>Absolutely futile!...All of these things are futile! </i>This motto is the theme of the book. Its occurs at the beginning (1:2) and end of the book (12:8), forming an envelope structure (<i>inclusio</i>). Everything described in 1:2--12:8 is the supporting proof of the thesis of 1:2. With few exceptions (e.g., 2:24-26; 3:14-15; 11:9-12:1, 9), everything described in 1:2--12:8 is characterized as "futile" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lb#h#</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn736" href="ecc.htm#fnB736"><sup>30</sup></a><b>sn</b> (12:9)  Eccl 12:9-12 fits the pattern of a concluding colophon, that draws from a conventional stock of ancient Near Eastern scribal practices and vocabulary. See M. Fishbane, <i>Biblical Interpretation in Ancient Israel </i>(Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1985), 29-31.<br>
 <a name="fn737" href="ecc.htm#fnB737"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn </b> (12:9) <i>Heb </i>"he weighed and studied." The verbs <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rqjw /zaw</FONT> ("he weighed and he explored") form a hendiadys (a figurative expression in which two separate terms used in combination to convey a single idea): "he studiously weighed" or "carefully evaluated." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/zaw</FONT> (conjunction + Piel perfect 3ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/za</FONT> II "to weigh; to balance") is related to the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/zam</FONT> "balances; scales" used for weighing money or commercial items (e.g., Jer 32:10; Ezek 5:1). This is the only use of the verb in the OT. In this context, it means "to weigh" = "to test; to prove" (BDB 24) or "to balance" (<i>HALOT </i>27). Cohen suggests, "He made an examination of the large number of proverbial sayings which had been composed, testing their truth and worth, to select those which he considered deserving of circulation" (A. Cohen<i>,</i> <i>The Soncino Books of the Bible</i>, 12.189).<br>
 <a name="fn738" href="ecc.htm#fnB738"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:9)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/qt</FONT> ("to make straight") connotes "to put straight" or "to arrange in order" (KBL3 1039; BDB 1075). This may refer to Qoheleth's activity in compiling a collection of wisdom sayings in an orderly manner, or writing the wisdom sayings in a straightforward, direct manner.<br>
 <a name="fn739" href="ecc.htm#fnB739"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:10)  In the construct phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jpj-yrbd</FONT> ("words of delight") the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jpj</FONT> ("delight") functions as an attributive genitive ("delightful words") or a genitive of estimation or worth ("words viewed as delightful by Qoheleth" or "words that he took delight in"). For another example of a genitive of estimation of worth, see <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yhla yjbz</FONT> "sacrifices of God" = "sacrifices viewed as acceptable to God" (Ps 51:19). In other words, Qoheleth wrote his proverbs so effectively that he was able to take moral and aesthetic delight in his words.<br>
 <a name="fn740" href="ecc.htm#fnB740"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tc</b> (12:10)  The consonantal form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwtkw</FONT> has been revocalized in three ways: (1) The Masoretes read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWtk*w+</FONT> (conjunction + Qal passive participle ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">btk</FONT> "to write"): "Qoheleth sought to find pleasant words, <i>what was written</i> uprightly, namely, words of truth." This is supported by the LXX's <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kai gegrammenon</FONT> (conjunction + perfect passive participle accusative ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">grafw</FONT> "to write). (2) The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest the vocalization <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">botk*w+</FONT> (conjunction + Qal infinitive absolute). The infinitive <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">botk*w+</FONT> ("and to write") in the B-line would parallel the infinitive of purpose <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ax)m=l!</FONT> ("to find") in the A-line: "Qoheleth sought to find pleasant words, <i>and to write</i> accurately words of truth." (3) Several medieval Hebrew MSS preserve an alternate textual tradition of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bt^k*w+</FONT> (conjunction + Qal perfect 3ms). This is reflected in the Greek versions (Aquilla and Symmachus), Syriac Peshitta and Vulgate. The major English versions are divided among these three textual options: (1) <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWtk*w+</FONT> (Qal passive participle): "<i>and that which was written</i> was upright, even words of truth" (KJV); "<i>and what is written</i> correctly, namely, true things" (AB); "<i>and that which was written</i> uprightly, even words of truth" (ASV); "<i>and, written</i> by the upright, words of truth" (YLT); "but <i>what he wrote</i> was the honest truth" (NEB); "<i>and what he wrote</i> was upright and true" (NIV). (2) <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">botk*w+</FONT> (Qal infinitive absolute): "<i>and to write</i> words of truth correctly" (NASB); "<i>and to write</i> correctly the reliable words of truth" (MLB); "<i>and to write down</i> true sayings with precision" (NAB). (3) <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bt^k*w+</FONT> (Qal perfect 3ms): "and uprightly <i>he wrote</i> words of truth" (RSV); "and <i>he wrote</i> words of truth plainly" (NRSV); "even as <i>he put down</i> plainly what was true" (Moffatt); "<i>and he wrote</i> words most right, and full of truth" (Douay); and "<i>and he recorded</i> genuinely truthful sayings" (NJPS). The editors of the Jerusalem Hebrew Bible project favor <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">botk*w+</FONT> "and to write" (option 2): see Dominique Barthelemy, ed. et al., <i>Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i> (New York: United Bible Society, 1976), 3.596-97.<br>
 <a name="fn741" href="ecc.htm#fnB741"><sup>35</sup></a>t<b>n</b> The construct phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tma yrbd</FONT> ("words of truth") is a genitive of content ("words containing truth") or an attributive genitive ("truthful words"). Depending upon the vocalization of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwtkw</FONT>, the phrase functions in one of two ways: (1) as direct object of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rv#y{ botk*w+</FONT> "and he accurately wrote <i>truthful words</i>"; or (2) in apposition to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rv#y{ bWtk*w+</FONT> "and what is written uprightly, namely, <i>truthful words.</i>"<br>

 <a name="fn743" href="ecc.htm#fnB743"><sup>37</sup></a><b>sn</b> (12:12)  The exhortation may be understood in two ways: (1) to avoid any so-called wisdom sayings beyond those mentioned in vv. 10-11: "The words of the wise...are given from one shepherd. And of anything beyond these, my son, be warned!" (see RSV, NRSV, NAB, Douay, NIV). This is paraphrased well by Moffatt: "My son, avoid anything beyond the scriptures of wisdom" (Moffatt). (2) The exhortation refers to the concerns of v. 12b, namely, diligent study is wearisome, i.e., "Furthermore, my son, be warned: there is no end to the making of books, and much study is wearisome to the body" (see NEB, AB, ASV, NASB, MLB).<br>
 <a name="fn744" href="ecc.htm#fnB744"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:12)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hcu</FONT> ("to do") may mean "to make" (<i>HALOT </i>890 [3]) or "to acquire" (<i>HALOT </i>891 [6]). The LXX rendered it as <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">poihsai</FONT> ("making"), as do most English versions: "making" (KJV, YLT, RSV, NRSV, AB, NAB, ASV, MLB, NIV, NJPS). However, several English versions reflect a different nuance: "there is no end to the buying of books" (Moffatt); "the use of books is endless" (NEB); and "the writing of many books is endless" (NASB).<br>
 <a name="fn745" href="ecc.htm#fnB745"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn </b> (12:12) <i>Heb</i><b> </b>"the flesh." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rcb</FONT> ("flesh") refers to the body, functioning as a synecdoche or part (i.e., flesh, skin) for the whole (i.e., body), e.g., Gen 17:13; Ps 16:9; Prov 14:30 (see Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 642).<br>
 <a name="fn746" href="ecc.htm#fnB746"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:13)  <i>Heb</i> "This is all men"; or "This is the whole of man." The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;dah-lk hz</FONT> ("this is all men") features rhetorical elision of a key word. The ambiguity over the elided word has led to no less than five basic approaches: (1) "this is the whole duty of man" (KJV, ASV, RSV, NAB, NIV); (2) "this is the duty of all men" (MLB, ASV margin, RSV margin); (3) "this applies to all men" (NASB, AB, NJPS); (4) "this is the whole duty of all men" (NRSV, Moffatt); and (5) "there is no more to man than this" (NEB). The four-fold repetition of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lk</FONT> ("all") in 12:13-14 suggests that Qoheleth is emphasizing the "bottom line," that is, the basic duty of man is simply to fear and obey God: After "all" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lk</FONT>) has been heard in the book, his conclusion is that the "whole" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lk</FONT>) duty of man is to obey God because God will bring "all" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lk</FONT>) acts into judgment, including "all" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lk</FONT>) that is hidden, whether good or bad.
