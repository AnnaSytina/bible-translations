<bqverse 1>1 </b>The vision that Obadiah<a name="fnB0" href="oba_note.htm#fn0"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> saw:<br>
The Lord GOD<a name="fnB1" href="oba_note.htm#fn1"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> says this concerning<a name="fnB2" href="oba_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> Edom.<a name="fnB3" href="oba_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494012968"></a></ul><p><i>Edom's Approaching Destruction</i>
<br>We have heard a report from the LORD.<br>
An envoy was sent among the nations, saying,<a name="fnB4" href="oba_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a><br>
"Arise; Let's make war against her!"<a name="fnB5" href="oba_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 2>2 The LORD says,<a name="fnB6" href="oba_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> "For look! I will<a name="fnB7" href="oba_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> make you small among the nations;<br>
you will be greatly despised!<br>

<bqverse 3>3 Your presumptuous heart<a name="fnB8" href="oba_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> has deceived you,<br>
you who sit in the concealed places of the rock,<a name="fnB9" href="oba_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a><br>
whose abode is high in the mountains.<br>
You think to yourself,<a name="fnB10" href="oba_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a><br>
`Who can bring me down to the ground?'<br>

<bqverse 4>4 Though you were to soar high like the eagle,<br>
though you<a name="fnB11" href="oba_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> were to make your nest among the stars,<br>
even from there I can bring you down,"<br>
says the LORD.<br>

<bqverse 5>5 "If thieves had come to you,<a name="fnB12" href="oba_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a><br>
or if plunderers had come during the night--<br>
O how you will be destroyed!<a name="fnB13" href="oba_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a>--<br>
would they not have stolen only what appealed to them?<br>
If grape gatherers had come to you,<br>
would they not have left some behind for the poor?<a name="fnB14" href="oba_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 6>6 How Esau<a name="fnB15" href="oba_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> is to be thoroughly searched!<br>
His hidden valuables to be found out!<br>

<bqverse 7>7  They will force<a name="fnB16" href="oba_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> you from your borders,<br>
all these allies<a name="fnB17" href="oba_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> of yours.<br>
They will deceive you, <br>
they will prevail against you,<br>
these people who were in league with you.<a name="fnB18" href="oba_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a><br>
Your friends<a name="fnB19" href="oba_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> will set a trap<a name="fnB20" href="oba_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> beneath you,<br>
but you will not even be aware of it!<br>

<bqverse 8>8 In that day," the LORD says,<br>
"will I not destroy those who are wise from Edom<br>
and understanding from Esau's mountain?<br>

<bqverse 9>9 Your warriors will be shattered, O Teman!<a name="fnB21" href="oba_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a><br>
So<a name="fnB22" href="oba_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> every one will be destroyed<a name="fnB23" href="oba_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> from Esau's mountain.<a name="_Toc494012969"></a></ul><p><i>Edom's Treachery Against Judah</i>
<br>
<bqverse 10>10 "Because of the slaughter<a name="fnB24" href="oba_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> and violence done to your brother Jacob<br>
shame will cover you, and you will be destroyed<a name="fnB25" href="oba_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> forever.<br>

<bqverse 11>11 You stood aloof<a name="fnB26" href="oba_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a><br>
while strangers took his army captive,<br>
and foreigners advanced to his gates.<a name="fnB27" href="oba_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a><br>
When they cast lots<a name="fnB28" href="oba_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> over Jerusalem,<br>
you behaved as though you were in league<a name="fnB29" href="oba_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> with them.<br>

<bqverse 12>12 You should not have gloated<a name="fnB30" href="oba_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> over your brother's day of trouble,<br>
this day of his calamity.<br>
You should not have rejoiced over the people of Judah<br>
on this day of their destruction.<br>
You should not have talked so big<a name="fnB31" href="oba_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> <br>
on this day of adversity.<br>

<bqverse 13>13 You should not have come against the gate of my people<br>
on this day of their distress.<a name="fnB32" href="oba_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a><br>
You should not have joined in gloating over their misfortune<br>
on this day of their distress.<br>
You should not have laid hands<a name="fnB33" href="oba_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> on their wealth<br>
on this day of their distress.<br>

<bqverse 14>14 You should not have stood at the fork in the road<a name="fnB34" href="oba_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a><br>
in order to slaughter<a name="fnB35" href="oba_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> their fugitives.<br>
You should not have imprisoned their refugees<br>
on this day of adversity.<a name="_Toc494012970"></a></ul><p><i>The Coming Day of the Lord</i>
<br>
<bqverse 15>15 "For the day of the LORD is approaching<a name="fnB36" href="oba_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a><br>
for all the nations!<br>
Exactly as you have done, so it will be done to you.<br>
Your recompense will return on your own head.<br>

<bqverse 16>16 For exactly as you have drunk<a name="fnB37" href="oba_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> on my holy mountain,<br>
so all the nations will drink continually.<br>
They will drink, and they will gulp down;<br>
they will be as though they had never been.<br>

<bqverse 17>17 But on Mount Zion there will be a remnant of those who escape,<a name="fnB38" href="oba_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a><br>
and it will be a holy place.<br>
The descendants<a name="fnB39" href="oba_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> of Jacob will dispossess<br>
those who were dispossessing them.<a name="fnB40" href="oba_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 18>18 The descendants of Jacob will be a fire,<br>
and the descendants of Joseph a flame.<br>
The descendants of Esau will be like stubble.<br>
They will burn them up and devour them.<br>
There will not be a single survivor<a name="fnB41" href="oba_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a><br>
to the descendants of Esau!"<br>
Indeed, the LORD has so spoken.<br>

<bqverse 19>19 The people of the Negev will possess Esau's mountain,<br>
and the people of the lowlands<a name="fnB42" href="oba_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> will possess the land of the Philistines.<br>
They will also possess the territory of Ephraim<br>
and the territory of Samaria,<br>
and the people of Benjamin will possess Gilead.<br>

<bqverse 20>20 The exiles of this fortress of the people of Israel<br>
will possess what belongs to the people of Canaan, as far as Zarephath,<br>
and the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad<br>
will possess the towns of the Negev.<br>

<bqverse 21>21 Those who have been delivered<a name="fnB43" href="oba_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> will go up on Mount Zion<br>
in order to rule over<a name="fnB44" href="oba_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> Esau's mountain,<br>
but the kingship will belong to the LORD!</ul><p></p>
