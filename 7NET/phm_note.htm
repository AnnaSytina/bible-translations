 <b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Grk</i> "Paul." The word "from" is not in the Greek text, but has been supplied to indicate the sender of the letter.<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="phm.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:1)  The phrase <i>a prisoner of Christ Jesus</i> implies that Paul was being held prisoner because of his testimony for Christ Jesus. Paul's imprisonment was due to his service to Christ, in the same manner as John was exiled to the Isle of Patmos because of his testimony (Rev 1:9).<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="phm.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1) <i> </i>"our"<i> </i>is not present in the Greek text, but was supplied to bring out the sense in English.<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="phm.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Grk </i>"dear." The adjective is functioning as a substantive; i.e., "dear one" or "dear friend."<br>
 <a name="fn4" href="phm.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:2)  <i>Apphia</i> is thought to be the wife of Philemon.<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="phm.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  Though the term "our" does not appear in the Greek text it is inserted to bring out the sense of the passage. <br>
 <a name="fn6" href="phm.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  <i>Grk</i> "Grace to you and peace."<br>
 <a name="fn7" href="phm.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:4)  <i>I always thank my God. </i>An offer of thanksgiving (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eujcaristw'</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">eucaristw</FONT>)<i> </i>to God is a customary formula for Paul in many of his epistles (cf. Rom 1:8, 1 Cor 1:4, Eph 1:16, Col 1:3, 1 Thess 1:2, 2 Thess 1:3). The content of the thanksgiving typically points to the work of God in the salvation of the believers to whom he [Paul] writes.<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="phm.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  <i>Grk </i>"making remembrance (or "mention") of you in my prayers."<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="phm.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  The Greek present participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajkouvwn </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">akouwn</FONT>, "hearing") is an adverbial participle of cause relating to <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eujcaristw'</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">eucaristw</FONT>, "I give thanks"). <br>
 <a name="fn10" href="phm.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:5)  <i>Your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints. </i>In accord with Paul, John also advocates this combination of "faith in Christ and love for the saints." The believers' invisible faith becomes visible in the demonstration of love for others. This, of course, is not only desired, but commanded (1 John 3:23). Although Paul's comment here may appear as a stock expression to the casual reader, praising Philemon for his track record of faithfulness to Christ demonstrated in love for the saints is actually integral to the author's argument in this short but pithy letter. Paul will soon ask Philemon to demonstrate this love toward Onesimus, his runaway slave.<br>
 <a name="fn11" href="phm.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  The Greek is somewhat awkward here. It appears as though the text reads "...the love and faith which you have for the Lord Jesus and for all the saints." In other Pauline letters the emphasis seems to be "faith in Christ Jesus and love for all of the saints." Some ancient MSS have altered the wording to produce a smoother reading; scribes changed the wording to resemble the more readable versions in Eph 1:15 and Col 1:4, "your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have to all the saints."<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="phm.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{pw" </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">{opw"</FONT>) refers back to the idea of prayer (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mneivan sou poiouvmeno" ejpiV tw'n proseucw'n mou</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">mneian sou poioumeno" epi twn proseucwn mou</FONT>) in 1:4. See BAGD 577 2.b; P. T. O'Brien, <i>Colossians, Philemon </i>(WBC), 279. The indicative "I pray that" was supplied in the English in order to make this connection clear.<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="phm.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:6)  Many ancient and diverse witnesses add the article <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tou'</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">tou</FONT>, translated "that is") here. The omission could be a case of haplography, but the diversity of witnesses coupled with the motivation of clarity suggests that the omission is original.<br>
 <b>tn</b> (1:6)  <i>Grk</i> "everything good." <br>
 <a name="fn14" href="phm.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:6)  <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uJmi'n</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jumin</FONT>, "in you") is found in many valuable witnesses (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>61 <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute; </FONT>33 1739 1881 it<sup>ar, b, f, g </sup>syr<sup>p,h</sup> sa bo arm). The witnesses for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJmi'n </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jhmin</FONT>, "in us") are not as strong (A C D <i>Byz</i> <i>et alii</i>), but <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJmi'n</FONT> is to be favored because of internal considerations: the first person pronoun is surrounded by second person pronouns and hence is the harder reading.<br>
 <a name="fn15" href="phm.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  <i>Grk</i> "that the fellowship of your faith might become effective in the knowledge of everything good that is in us in Christ." There are numerous difficulties with the translation and interpretation of this verse: (1) What is the meaning of<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek"> hJ koinwniva th'" pivstew" sou</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jh koinwnia th" pistew" sou</FONT>, "the fellowship of your faith")? Several suggestions are noted: (a) taking <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">koinwniva </FONT>as a reference to "monetary support" and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">th'" pivstew" </FONT>as a genitive of source, the phrase could refer to Philemon's financial giving which he has done according to his faith; (b) taking <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">koinwniva </FONT>as a reference to "sharing" or "communicating" and the genitive <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">th'" pivstew" </FONT>as an objective genitive, then the meaning would be "sharing the faith" as a reference to evangelistic activity; (c) taking <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">koinwniva </FONT>in a distributive sense referring to fellowship with other believers, and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">th'" pivstew" </FONT>as a reference to the common trust all Christians have in Jesus, then the meaning is Christian fellowship centered on faith in Jesus; (d) taking <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">koinwniva </FONT>as a reference to "participation" and the genitive <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">th'" pivstew" </FONT>as a reference to the thing participated in, the meaning would then be Philemon's "participation in the faith"; (2) what is the meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejnerghv" </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">energh"</FONT>; Does it mean "active" or "effective"?) and<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek"> ejpignwvsei </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">epignwsei</FONT>; Does it refer to simply understanding? Or "experiencing" as well?); (3) what is the meaning of the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pantoV" ajgaqou'</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">panto" agaqou</FONT>)? and (4) what is the force of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij" Cristovn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ei" Criston</FONT>)? It is difficult to arrive at an interpretation that deals adequately with all these questions, but given the fact that Paul stresses what Philemon has done for the brothers (cf. the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">gavr </FONT>[<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">gar</FONT>] in v. 7), it seems that his concern in v. 6 is on Philemon's fellowship with other believers and how he has worked hard to refresh them. In this interpretation: (1) the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJ koinwniva th'" pivstew" sou </FONT>is taken to refer to fellowship with other believers; (2) <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejnerghv" </FONT>is taken to mean "effective" (i.e., <i>more </i>effective) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejpignwvsei </FONT>involves both understanding and experience; (3) the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pantoV" ajgaqou' </FONT>refers to every spiritual blessing and (4) <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij" Cristovn </FONT>carries a locative idea meaning "in Christ." The result is that Paul prays for Philemon that he will be equipped to encourage and love the saints <i>more</i> as he himself is brought to a place of deeper understanding of every spiritual blessing he has in Christ; out of the overflow of his own life, he will minister to others. <br>
 <a name="fn16" href="phm.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  Here <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">gavr</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">gar</FONT>) has not been translated because of differences between Greek and contemporary English style.<br>
 <a name="fn17" href="phm.htm#fnB17"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  The Greek preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejpiv </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">epi</FONT>) is understood here in a causal sense, i.e., "because." <br>
 <a name="fn18" href="phm.htm#fnB18"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  The word translated "heart" here is <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">splavgcna</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">splancna</FONT>). Literally the term refers to one's "inward parts," but it is commonly used figuratively for "heart" as the <i>seat of the emotions. </i>See BAGD 763 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">splavgcnon</FONT> 1.b (cf. Col 3:12, Phil 2:1).<br>
 <a name="fn19" href="phm.htm#fnB19"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  Or "encourage." <br>
 <a name="fn20" href="phm.htm#fnB20"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  Or perhaps "an ambassador" (so RSV), reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">presbeuthv"</FONT> for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">presbuvth"</FONT> (a conjecture proposed by Bentley, cf. BAGD 700 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">presbuvth"</FONT>). NRSV reads "old man" and places "ambassador" in a note.<br>
 <a name="fn21" href="phm.htm#fnB21"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  <i>Grk </i>"a prisoner of Christ Jesus." <br>
 <a name="fn22" href="phm.htm#fnB22"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  Or "I am encouraging..." <br>
 <a name="fn23" href="phm.htm#fnB23"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  <i>Grk</i> "my child whom I have begotten." The adjective "spiritual" has been supplied before "father" in the translation to clarify for the modern reader that Paul did not literally father a child during his imprisonment. Paul's point is that he was instrumental in Onesimus' conversion while in prison. <br>
 <a name="fn24" href="phm.htm#fnB24"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:10)  <i>During my imprisonment. </i>Apparently Onesimus became a believer under Paul's shepherding while he [Paul] was a prisoner in Rome.<br>
 <a name="fn25" href="phm.htm#fnB25"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:11)  <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>, "<i>both</i> you") is added by several ancient witnesses, either to clarify the meaning or in imitation of the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">nuniV deV kaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">nuni de kai</FONT>) in v. 9. <br>
 <a name="fn26" href="phm.htm#fnB26"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:12)  <i>Grk </i>"whom I have sent." The Greek sentence was broken up in the English translation for the sake of clarity. Although the tense of the Greek verb here is past (an aorist tense) the reader should understand that Onesimus was probably standing in the very presence of Paul as he wrote this letter. <br>
 <a name="fn27" href="phm.htm#fnB27"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:12)  That is, "who means a great deal to me"; <i>Grk </i>"whom I have sent to you, him, this one is my heart." <br>
 <a name="fn28" href="phm.htm#fnB28"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13)  This is one of the clearest texts in the NT in which <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uJpevr</FONT> is used for substitution. Cf. D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax</i>, 387.<br>
 <a name="fn29" href="phm.htm#fnB29"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13)  <i>Grk</i> "in my imprisonment." Paul seems to expect release from his imprisonment after some time (cf. v. 22), but in the meantime the assistance that Onesimus could provide would be valuable to the apostle.<br>
 <a name="fn30" href="phm.htm#fnB30"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13)  <i>Grk </i>"in the chains of the gospel." On the translation "imprisonment for the sake of the gospel," cf. BAGD 176 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">desmov" </FONT>1 where it says: "Oft. simply <i>imprisonment</i>, <i>prison</i> (Diod. S. 14, 103, 3; Lucian, Tox. 29; Jos., Ant. 13, 294; 302, Vi. 241) Phil 1:7, 13f, 17; Col 4:18; Phlm 10. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mevcri desmw'n</FONT> 2 Ti 2:9. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn toi'" d. tou' eujaggelivou</FONT> <i>in imprisonment for the gospel</i> Phlm 13; cf. ISm 11:1; Pol 1:1." <br>
 <a name="fn31" href="phm.htm#fnB31"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:14)  Though the Greek text does not read the term "however," it is clearly implied and thus supplied in the English translation to accent the contrastive nature of Paul's statement. <br>
 <a name="fn32" href="phm.htm#fnB32"><sup>33</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:15)  <i>So that you would have him back eternally. </i>The notion here is not that Onesimus was to be the slave of Philemon <i>eternally</i>, but that their new relationship as brothers in Christ would transcend the societal structures of this age. The occasion of Onesimus' flight to Rome would ultimately be a catalyst in the formation of a new and stronger bond between these two men.<br>
 <a name="fn33" href="phm.htm#fnB33"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:16)  Although the Greek word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dou'lo"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">doulos</FONT>) is sometimes translated "servant" here (so KJV), the word "slave" is a much more candid and realistic picture of the relationship between Philemon and Onesimus. In the Greco-Roman world of the 1st century the slave was considered a "living tool" of the master. The slave was "property" in every sense of the word. This understanding heightens the tense scenario that is in view here. It is likely that Onesimus may have even feared for his life upon returning to Colossae. Undoubtedly Paul has asked this runaway slave to return to what could amount to a potentially severe and life-endangering situation.<br>
 <a name="fn34" href="phm.htm#fnB34"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:16)  <i>Grk </i>"in the flesh."<br>
 <a name="fn35" href="phm.htm#fnB35"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:18)  <i>Grk</i> "charge it to me."<br>
 <a name="fn36" href="phm.htm#fnB36"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:19)  <i>Grk</i> "I wrote" Here <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">e[graya </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">egraya</FONT>) is functioning as an epistolary aorist. Paul puts it in the past tense because from Philemon's perspective when he reads the letter it will, of course, already have been written. <br>
 <a name="fn37" href="phm.htm#fnB37"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:19)  The phrase "this letter" does not appear in the Greek text, but is supplied in the English translation to clarify the meaning.<br>
 <a name="fn38" href="phm.htm#fnB38"><sup>39</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:19)  <i>With my own hand. </i>Paul may have considered this letter so delicate that he wrote the letter himself as opposed to using an amanuensis or secretary.<br>
 <a name="fn39" href="phm.htm#fnB39"><sup>40</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:19)  The statement <i>you owe me your very self</i> means that Paul was responsible for some sort of blessing in the life of Philemon; though a monetary idea may be in mind, it is perhaps better to understand Paul as referring to the spiritual truth (i.e., the gospel) he had taught Philemon.<br>
 <a name="fn40" href="phm.htm#fnB40"><sup>41</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:20)  <i>Refresh my heart in Christ. </i>Paul desired that Philemon <i>refresh</i> his heart in the same way that he [Philemon] had refreshed the hearts of other believers (cf. Phlm 7), that is, by forgiving and accepting Onesimus. In this way the presence and character of Jesus Christ would be vividly seen in Philemon's attitude toward his runaway slave.<br>
 <a name="fn41" href="phm.htm#fnB41"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:21)  <i>Grk</i> "that you would even go beyond."<br>
 <a name="fn42" href="phm.htm#fnB42"><sup>43</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:23)  <i>Epaphras</i> is probably a shortened form of the name Epaphroditus. This is probably the same individual whom Paul spoke of as "my brother, coworker, and fellow soldier" in Phil 2:25 (see also Phil 4:18). He is also mentioned in Col 1:7 and 4:12, where he is a founder of the church in Colossae (BAGD 283 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">*Epafra'"</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn43" href="phm.htm#fnB43"><sup>44</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:24)  <i>Aristarchus</i> accompanied Paul on his collection-journey when Paul left for Rome in Acts 27:2. He is also mentioned as a fellow prisoner in Col 4:10.<br>
 <a name="fn44" href="phm.htm#fnB44"><sup>45</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:24)  <i>Demas</i> is most likely the same individual mentioned by the Apostle Paul in 2 Tim 4:12. Apparently, he later on abandoned the faith because of his love of the world.<br>
 <a name="fn45" href="phm.htm#fnB45"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:25)  <i>Grk </i>"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ with your spirit." The elided verb, normally an optative, has been rendered as "be."
