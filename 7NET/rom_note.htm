 <b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Grk</i> "Paul." The word "from" is not in the Greek text, but has been supplied to indicate the sender of the letter.<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="rom.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  Traditionally, "servant." Though <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dou'lo"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">doulos</FONT>) is normally translated "servant," the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BAGD notes that "`servant' for `slave' is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times...in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished" (BAGD 205 s.v.). The most accurate translation is "bondservant" (sometimes found in the ASV for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dou'lo"</FONT>), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:1)  Undoubtedly the background for the concept of being the Lord's slave or servant is to be found in the Old Testament scriptures. For a Jew this concept did not connote drudgery, but honor and privilege. It was used of national Israel at times (Isa 43:10), but was especially associated with famous OT personalities, including such great men as Moses (Joshua 14:7), David (Ps 89:3; cf. 2 Sam 7:5, 8) and Elijah (2 Kings 10:10); all these men were "servants (or slaves) of the Lord."<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="rom.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:1)  Many important MSS reverse the order of these words and read "of Jesus Christ" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>26 <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> A D G 33 1739 <i>Byz</i>) rather than "Christ Jesus" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>10 B 81). The meaning is not affected in either case, but the reading "Christ Jesus" is preferred as more difficult and more likely the original (a scribe who found it would be more likely to change it to the more common expression).<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="rom.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Grk</i> "a called apostle."<br>
 <a name="fn4" href="rom.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  <i>Grk</i> "born of the seed" (an idiom).<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="rom.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  <i>Grk</i> "according to the flesh," indicating Jesus' earthly life, a reference to its weakness. This phrase implies that Jesus was more than human; otherwise it would have been sufficient to say that he was a descendant of David, cf. L. Morris, <i>Romans</i>, 44.<br>
 <a name="fn6" href="rom.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:4)  <i>Appointed the Son-of-God-in-power. </i>Most translations render the Greek participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJrisqevnto"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jorisqentes</FONT>, from <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJrivzw</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jorizw</FONT>) "declared" or "designated" in order to avoid the possible interpretation that Jesus was appointed the Son of God by the resurrection. However, the Greek term <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJrivzw</FONT> is used eight times in the NT, and it always has the meaning "to determine, appoint." Paul is not saying that Jesus was appointed the "Son of God by the resurrection" but "Son-of-God-in-power by the resurrection," hence the hyphenation. He was born in weakness in human flesh (<i>with respect to the flesh</i>, v. 3) and he was raised with power. This is similar to Matt 28:18 where Jesus told his disciples after the resurrection, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."<br>
 <a name="fn7" href="rom.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  <i>Grk</i> "spirit of holiness." Some interpreters take the phrase to refer to Christ's own inner spirit, which was characterized by holiness.<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="rom.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  Or "by his resurrection." Most interpreters see this as a reference to Jesus' own resurrection, although some take it to refer to the general resurrection at the end of the age, of which Jesus' resurrection is the first installment (cf. 1 Cor 15:23).<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="rom.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Grk</i> "through whom."<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="rom.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  Some interpreters understand the phrase "grace and apostleship" as a hendiadys, translating "grace [i.e., gift] of apostleship."<br>
 <a name="fn11" href="rom.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Grk</i> "and apostleship for obedience."<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="rom.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uJpakohV pivstew"</FONT> has been variously understood as (1) an objective genitive (a reference to the Christian faith, "obedience to [the] faith"); (2) a subjective genitive ("the obedience faith produces [or requires]"); (3) an attributive genitive ("believing obedience"); or (4) as a genitive of apposition ("obedience, [namely] faith") in which "faith" further defines "obedience." These options are discussed by C. E. B. Cranfield, <i>Romans</i> (ICC), 1:66. Others take the phrase as deliberately ambiguous; see D. B. Garlington, "The Obedience of Faith in the Letter to the Romans: Part I: The Meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uJpakohV pivstew"</FONT> (Rom 1:5; 16:26)," <i>WTJ</i> 52 (1990): 201-24.<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="rom.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  <i>Grk</i> "among whom you also are called." Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation. The NIV, with its translation "And you also are among those who are called," takes the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn oi}" ejste </FONT>to refer to the following clause rather than the preceding, so that the addressees of the letter ("you also") are not connected with "all the Gentiles" mentioned at the end of v. 5. It is more likely, however, that the relative pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oi}"</FONT> has <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">toi'" e[qnesin</FONT> as its antecedent, which would indicate that the church at Rome was predominantly Gentile.<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="rom.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  <i>Grk</i> "called of Jesus Christ."<br>

 <a name="fn16" href="rom.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:8)  <i>Grk</i> "First." Paul never mentions a second point, so J. B. Phillips translated "I must begin by telling you...."<br>

 <a name="fn21" href="rom.htm#fnB21"><sup>22</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:13)  The expression "I do not want you to be unaware [<i>Grk</i> ignorant]" also occurs in 1 Cor 10:1; 12:1; 1 Thess 4:13. Paul uses the phrase to signal that he is about to say something very important.<br>
 <a name="fn22" href="rom.htm#fnB22"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13)  <i>Grk</i> "brothers," but the Greek word may be used for "brothers and sisters" or "fellow Christians" as here (cf. BAGD 16 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajdelfov" </FONT>1, where considerable nonbiblical evidence for the plural <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajdelfoiv</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">adelfoi</FONT>] meaning "brothers and sisters" is cited).<br>

The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">provqumo"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">proqumo"</FONT>, "eager, willing") is used only elsewhere in the NT in Matt 26:41 = Mark 14:38: "the spirit indeed is willing (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">provqumo"</FONT>), but the flesh is weak."<br>

 <a name="fn27" href="rom.htm#fnB27"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:17)  The nature of the "righteousness" described here and the force of the genitive <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qeou'</FONT> ("of God") which follows have been much debated. (1) Some (e.g. C. E. B. Cranfield, <i>Romans </i>[ICC], 1:98) understand "righteousness" to refer to the righteous status given to believers as a result of God's justifying activity, and see the genitive "of God" as a genitive of source (= "from God"). (2) Others see the "righteousness" as God's act or declaration that makes righteous (i.e., justifies) those who turn to him in faith, taking the genitive "of God" as a subjective genitive (see E. K&auml;semann, <i>Romans</i>, 25-30). (3) Still others see the "righteousness of God" mentioned here as the attribute of God himself, understanding the genitive "of God" as a possessive genitive ("God's righteousness").<br>
 <a name="fn28" href="rom.htm#fnB28"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:17)  <i>Grk</i> "in it"; the referent (the gospel) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn29" href="rom.htm#fnB29"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:17)  Or "by faith for faith," or "by faith to faith." There are many interpretations of the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejk pivstew" eij" pivstin </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ek pistew" ei" pistin</FONT>). It may have the idea that this righteousness is obtained by faith (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejk pivstew"</FONT>) because it was designed for faith (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij" pivstin</FONT>). For a summary see J. Murray, <i>Romans</i> (NICNT), 1:363-74.<br>

 <a name="fn31" href="rom.htm#fnB31"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:18)  The genitive <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajnqrwvpwn</FONT> could be taken as an attributed genitive, in which case the phase should be translated "against all ungodly and unrighteous people" (cf. "the truth of God" in v. 25 which is also probably an attributed genitive). C. E. B. Cranfield takes the section 1:18-32 to refer to <i>all</i> people (not just Gentiles), while 2:1-3:20 points out that the Jew is no exception (<i>Romans</i> [ICC], 1:104-6; 1:137-38).<br>

 <a name="fn58" href="rom.htm#fnB58"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:1)  <i>Rom 2:1-29</i> presents unusual difficulties for the interpreter. There have been several major approaches to the chapter and the group(s) it refers to: (1) Rom 2:14 refers to Gentile Christians, not Gentiles who obey the Jewish law. (2) Paul in Rom 2 is presenting a hypothetical viewpoint: if anyone could obey the law, that person would be justified, but no one can. (3) The reference to "the ones who do the law" in 2:13 are those who "do" the law in the right way, on the basis of faith, not according to Jewish legalism. (4) Rom 2:13 only speaks about Christians being judged in the future, along with such texts as Rom 14:10 and 2 Cor 5:10. (5) Paul's material in Rom 2 is drawn heavily from Diaspora Judaism, so that the treatment of the law presented here cannot be harmonized with other things Paul says about the law elsewhere (E. P. Sanders, <i>Paul, the Law, and the Jewish People</i>, 123); another who sees Rom 2 as an example of Paul's inconsistency in his treatment of the law is H. R&auml;is&auml;nen, <i>Paul and the Law</i>, 101-109. (6) The list of blessings and curses in Deut 27-30 provide the background for Rom 2; the Gentiles of 2:14 are Gentile Christians, but the condemnation of Jews in 2:17-24 addresses the failure of Jews as a nation to keep the law as a whole (A. Ito, "Romans 2: A Deuteronomistic Reading," <i>JSNT</i> 59 [1995]: 21-37).<br>
 <a name="fn59" href="rom.htm#fnB59"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:1)  Some interpreters (e.g., C. K.

Some recent scholars have understood the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">e]rga novmou</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">erga nomou</FONT>, "works of the law") to refer not to obedience to the Mosaic law generally, but specifically to portions of the law that pertain to things like circumcision and dietary laws which set the Jewish people apart from the other nations (e.g., J. D. G. Dunn, <i>Romans</i> [WBC], 1:155). Other interpreters, like C. E. B. Cranfield ("`The Works of the Law' in the Epistle to the Romans," <i>JSNT</i> 43 [1991]: 89-101) reject this narrow interpretation for a number of reasons, among which the most important are: (1) The second half of v. 20, "for through the law comes the knowledge of sin," is hard to explain if the phrase "works of the law" is understood in a restricted sense; (2) the plural phrase "works of the law" would have to be understood in a different sense from the singular phrase "the work of the law" in 2:15; (3) similar phrases involving the law in Romans (2:13, 14; 2:25, 26, 27; 7:25; 8:4; and 13:8) which are naturally related to the phrase "works of the law" cannot be taken to refer to circumcision (in fact, in 2:25 circumcision is explicitly contrasted with keeping the law). Those interpreters who reject the "narrow" interpretation of "works of the law" understand the phrase to refer to obedience to the Mosaic law in general.<br>

Howard, "The `Faith of Christ'," <i>ExpTim</i> 85 (1974): 212-15; R. B. Hays, <i>The Faith of Jesus Christ</i>; Morna D. Hooker, "<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Pivsti" Cristou'</FONT>," <i>NTS</i> 35 (1989): 321-42). Noteworthy among the arguments for the subjective genitive view is that when <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pivsti" </FONT>takes a personal genitive it is almost never an objective genitive (cf. Matt 9:2, 22, 29; Mark 2:5; 5:34; 10:52; Luke 5:20; 7:50; 8:25, 48; 17:19; 18:42; 22:32; Rom 1:8; 12; 3:3; 4:5, 12, 16; 1 Cor 2:5; 15:14, 17; 2 Cor 10:15; Phil 2:17; Col 1:4; 2:5; 1 Thess 1:8; 3:2, 5, 10; 2 Thess 1:3; Titus 1:1; Phlm 6; 1 Pet 1:9, 21; 2 Pet 1:5). <br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:22)  D. B.

More likely, though, it refers specifically to the "mercy seat," i.e., the covering of the ark where the blood was sprinkled in the OT ritual on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). This term is used only one other time in the NT: Heb 9:5, where it is rendered "mercy seat." There it describes the altar in the most holy place (holy of holies). Thus Paul is saying that God displayed Jesus as the "mercy seat," the place where propitiation was accomplished. See N. S. L. Fryer, "The Meaning and Translation of <i>Hilasterion</i> in Romans 3:25," <i>EvQ</i> (1987): 99-116, who concludes the term is a neuter accusative substantive best translated "mercy seat" or "propitiatory covering," and D.

The translation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">wJ" o[nta</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jw" onta</FONT>) allows for two different interpretations. If it has the force of result, then <i>creatio ex nihilo</i> is in view and the variant rendering is to be accepted (so C. E. B. Cranfield, <i>Romans</i> [ICC], 1:244). A problem with this view is the scarcity of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">wJ" </FONT>plus participle to indicate result (though for the telic idea with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">wJ" </FONT>plus participle, cf. Rom 15:15; 1 Thess 2:4). If it has a comparative force, then the translation given in the text is to be accepted: "this interpretation fits the <i>immediate</i> context better than a reference to God's creative power, for it explains the assurance with which God can speak of the `many nations' that will be descended from Adam" (D. Moo, <i>Romans</i> [NICNT], 282; so also W. Sanday and A. C. Headlam, <i>Romans</i> [ICC], 113). Further, this view is in line with a Pauline idiom, viz., verb followed by <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">wJ" </FONT>plus participle (of the same verb or, in certain contexts, its antonym) to compare present reality with what is not a present reality (cf. 1 Cor 4:7; 5:3; 7:29, 30 (three times), 31; Col 2:20 [similarly, 2 Cor 6:9, 10]).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (4:25)  The verb translated <i>given over</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">paradivdwmi</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">paradidwmi</FONT>) is also used in Rom 1:24, 26, 28 to describe <i>God </i>giving people over to sin. But it is also used frequently in the gospels to describe Jesus being handed over (or delivered up, betrayed) by sinful men for crucifixion (cf., e.g., Matt 26:21; 27:4; Mark 8:31; 9:31; 10:33; 15:15; Luke 20:20; 22:24; 24:7). It is probable that Paul has both ideas in mind: Jesus was handed over by sinners, but even this betrayal was directed by the Father for our sake (<i>because of our transgressions</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn200" href="rom.htm#fnB200"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:25)  <i>Grk</i> "because of." However, in light of the unsatisfactory sense that a causal nuance would here suggest, it has been argued that the second <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">diav</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">dia</FONT>) is prospective rather than retrospective (D. Moo, <i>Romans</i> [NICNT], 288-89). The difficulty of this interpretation is the structural balance that both <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">diav</FONT> phrases provide ("given over because of our transgressions...raised because of our justification"). However the poetic structure of this verse strengthens the likelihood that both clauses may bear a different force.<br>
 <a name="fn201" href="rom.htm#fnB201"><sup>45</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:25)  Many scholars regard Rom 4:25 to be poetic or hymnic. These terms are used broadly to refer to the genre of writing, not to the content. There are two broad criteria for determining if a passage is poetic or hymnic: "(a) <i>stylistic:</i> a certain rhythmical lilt when the passages are read aloud, the presence of <i>parallelismus membrorum</i> (i.e., an arrangement into couplets), the semblance of some metre, and the presence of rhetorical devices such as alliteration, <i>chiasmus</i>, and antithesis; and (b) <i>linguistic: </i>an unusual vocabulary, particularly the presence of theological terms, which is different from the surrounding context" (P. T. O'Brien, <i>Philippians </i>[NIGTC], 188-9). Classifying a passage as hymnic or poetic is important because understanding this genre can provide keys to interpretation. However, not all scholars agree that the above criteria are present in this passage.<br>
 <a name="fn202" href="rom.htm#fnB202"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:1)  Many interpreters see Rom 5:1 as beginning the second major division of the letter.<br>
 <a name="fn203" href="rom.htm#fnB203"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tc</b> (5:1)  A number of important witnesses have the subjunctive <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">e[cwmen</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ecwmen</FONT>, "let us have") for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">e[comen</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ecomen</FONT>, "we have") in v. 1. Included in the subjunctive's support are <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT>* A B* C D K L 33 1739* lat bo <i>et plu</i>. But the indicative is not without its supporters: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT><sup>1 </sup>B<sup>2</sup> F G P <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Y</FONT> 0220<sup><i>vid </i></sup>1241 1506 1739<sup>c </sup>1881 2464 <i>et plu</i>. If the problem were to be solved on an external basis only, the subjunctive would be preferred. Clearly, the "A" rating on behalf of the indicative in the UBS4 is overly generous. Nevertheless, the indicative is probably correct. First, the earliest witness to Rom 5:1 has the indicative (0220). Second, the first set of correctors is usually of equal importance with the original hand. Hence, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT><sup>1 </sup>should be given equal value with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT>*. Third, there is a good cross-section of witnesses for the indicative: Alexandrian (in 0220, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT><sup>1 </sup>1241 1506 1881 <i>et alii</i>), Western (in F G), and Byzantine (noted in the Nestle text as <i>pm</i>). Thus, although the external evidence is strongly in favor of the subjunctive, the indicative is represented well enough that its ancestry could easily go back to the original. Turning to the internal evidence, the indicative gains much ground. First, the variant was more than likely produced via an error of hearing (since <i>omicron</i> and <i>omega</i> were pronounced alike in ancient Greek). This, of course, does not indicate which reading was original--just that an error of hearing produced one of them. In light of the indecisiveness of the transcriptional evidence, intrinsic evidence could play a much larger role. This is indeed the case here. First, the indicative fits well with the overall argument of the book to this point. Up until now, Paul has been establishing the "indicatives of the faith." There is only one imperative (used rhetorically) and only one hortatory subjunctive (and this in a quotation within diatribe) up till this point, while from ch. 6 on there are sixty-one imperatives and seven hortatory subjunctives. Clearly, an exhortation would be out of place in ch. 5. Second, Paul presupposes that the audience has peace with God (via reconciliation) in 5:10. This seems to assume the indicative in v. 1. Third, as C. E. B. Cranfield notes, "it would surely be strange for Paul, in such a carefully argued writing as this, to exhort his readers to enjoy or to guard a peace which he has not yet explicitly shown to be possessed by them" (<i>Romans</i> [ICC], 1:257). Fourth, the notion that <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eijrhvnhn e[cwmen</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">eirhnhn ecwmen</FONT>) can even naturally mean "enjoy peace" is problematic (D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax</i>, 464). Thus, although the external evidence is stronger in support of the subjunctive, the internal evidence points to the indicative.<br>

 <a name="fn275" href="rom.htm#fnB275"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:7)  <i>Romans 7:7-25.</i> There has been an enormous debate over the significance of the first person singular pronouns ("I") in this passage and how to understand their referent. Did Paul intend (1) a reference to himself and other Christians too; (2) a reference to his own pre-Christian experience as a Jew, struggling with the law and sin (and thus addressing his fellow countrymen as Jews); or (3) a reference to himself as a child of Adam, reflecting the experience of Adam that is shared by both Jews and Gentiles alike (i.e., all people everywhere)? Good arguments can be assembled for each of these views, and each has problems dealing with specific statements in the passage. The classic argument against an autobiographical interpretation was made by W. G. K&uuml;mmel, <i>R&ouml;mer 7 und die Bekehrung des Paulus</i>. A good case for seeing at least an autobiographical element in the chapter has been made by G. Theissen, <i>Psychologische Aspekte Paulinischer Theologie</i>, 181-268. One major point that seems to favor some sort of an autobiographical reading of these verses is the lack of any mention of the Holy Spirit for empowerment in the struggle described in Rom 7:7-25. The Spirit is mentioned beginning in 8:1 as the solution to the problem of the struggle with sin (8:4-6, 9).<br>

Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax</i>, 160-61, however notes the following: "At issue, grammatically, is whether the Spirit testifies <i>alongside of </i>our spirit (dat. of association), or whether he testifies <i>to our spirit</i> (indirect object) that we are God's children. If the former, the one receiving this testimony is unstated (is it God? or believers?). If the latter, the believer receives the testimony and hence is assured of salvation via the inner witness of the Spirit. The first view has the advantage of a <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">suvn</FONT>- (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">sun</FONT>-) prefixed verb, which might be expected to take an accompanying dat. of association (and is supported by NEB, JB, etc.). But there are three reasons why <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pneuvmati</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">pneumati</FONT>) should <i>not</i> be taken as association: (1) Grammatically, a dat. with a <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">suvn</FONT>- prefixed verb does not necessarily indicate association. This, of course, does not preclude such here, but this fact at least opens up the alternatives in this text. (2) Lexically, though <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">summarturevw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">summarturew</FONT>) originally bore an associative idea, it developed in the direction of merely intensifying <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">marturevw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">marturew</FONT>). This is surely the case in the only other NT text with a dat. (Rom 9:1). (3) Contextually, a dat. of association does not seem to support Paul's argument: `What standing has our spirit in <i>this</i> matter? Of itself it surely has no right at all to testify to our being sons of God' [C. E. B. Cranfield, <i>Romans </i>[ICC], 1:403]. In sum, Rom 8:16 seems to be secure as a text in which the believer's assurance of salvation is based on the inner witness of the Spirit. The implications of this for one's soteriology are profound: The objective data, as helpful as they are, cannot by themselves provide <i>assurance</i> of salvation; the believer also needs (and receives) an existential, ongoing encounter with God's Spirit in order to gain that familial comfort."<br>
 <a name="fn310" href="rom.htm#fnB310"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:17)  <i>Grk</i> "on the one hand, heirs of God; on the other hand, fellow heirs with Christ." Some prefer to render v. 17 as follows: "And if children, then heirs--that is, heirs of God. Also fellow heirs with Christ if indeed we suffer with him so we may also be glorified with him." Such a translation suggests two distinct inheritances, one coming to all of God's children, the other coming only to those who suffer with Christ. The difficulty of this view, however, is that it ignores the correlative conjunctions <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">mevn...dev</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">men</FONT><FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">...</FONT><FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">de</FONT>, "on the one hand... on the other hand"): the construction strongly suggests that the inheritances cannot be separated since both explain "then heirs."

One area of difficulty is the relationship between Israel and the church, especially concerning the nature and extent of Israel's election. Many different models have been constructed to express this relationship. For a representative survey, see M. Barth, <i>The People of God</i>, 22-27. The literary genre of these three chapters has been frequently identified as a diatribe, a philosophical discussion or conversation evolved by the Cynic and Stoic schools of philosophy as a means of popularizing their ideas (E. K&auml;semann, <i>Romans</i>, 261 and 267). But other recent scholars have challenged the idea that Rom 9-11 is characterized by diatribe. Scholars like R. Scroggs and E. E. Ellis have instead identified the material in question as midrash. For a summary and discussion of the rabbinic connections, see W. R. Stegner, "Romans 9.6-29--A Midrash," <i>JSNT</i> 22 (1984): 37-52.<br>

God who is over all be blessed forever!" or "the Messiah who is over all. God be blessed forever!" The translational difficulty here is not text-critical in nature, but is a problem of punctuation. Since the genre of these opening verses of Romans 9 is a lament, it is probably best to take this as an affirmation of Christ's deity (as the text renders it). Although the other renderings are possible, to see a note of praise to God at the end of this section seems strangely out of place. But for Paul to bring his lament to a crescendo (that is to say, his kinsmen had rejected <i>God</i> come in the flesh), thereby deepening his anguish, is wholly appropriate.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (16:7)  The feminine name <i>Junia</i>, though common in Latin, is quite rare in Greek (apparently only three instances of it occur in Greek literature outside Rom 16:7, according to the data in the <i>TLG</i> [D. Moo, <i>Romans </i>[NICNT], 922]). The masculine <i>Junias</i> (as a contraction for <i>Junianas</i>), however, is completely unattested in Greek literature. Further, since there are apparently other husband-wife teams mentioned in this salutation (Prisca and Aquila [v. 3], Philologus and Julia [v. 15]), it might be natural to think of Junia as a feminine name. (This ought not be pressed too far, however, for in v. 12 <i>all </i>three individuals are women [though the first two are linked together], and in vv. 9-11 all the individuals are men.) In Greek only a difference of accent distinguishes between Junias (male) and Junia (female). If it refers to a woman, it is possible (1) that she had the gift of apostleship (not the office), or (2) that she was not an apostle but along with Andronicus was esteemed by (or among) the apostles. As well, the term "prominent" may simply mean "well known," suggesting that Andronicus and Junia(s) were well known to the apostles.<br>

In particular, the article is lacking in these witnesses (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>46: Gal 3:26; Eph 4:26; 6:16; Phil 3:10, <i>et al.</i>; B: Gal 5:7; Eph 4:26; 5:21; Phil 3:10, <i>et al.</i>). The uncharacteristic <i>addition</i> of an article seems to indicate an original reading. There is further significance in this fact: if the second article in the construction is lacking, this construction constitutes a "Granville Sharp construction." It would be the <i>only</i> such construction in the NT in which an adjective and noun in the plural combined to indicate the same referents (that is to say, that both Andronicus and Junia were kinsmen and fellow prisoners). <br>
 <a name="fn523" href="rom.htm#fnB523"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:7)  Or "prominent, outstanding, famous." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejpivshmo"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">epishmo"</FONT>) is used either in an implied comparative sense ("prominent, outstanding") or in an elative sense ("famous, well known"). The key to determining the meaning of the term in any given passage is both the general context and the specific collocation of this word with its adjuncts. When a comparative notion is seen, that to which <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejpivshmo"</FONT> is compared is frequently, if not usually, put in the genitive case (cf., e.g., 3 Macc 6:1 [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Eleazaro" dev ti" ajnhVr <i>ejpivshmo" tw'n </i>ajpoV thv" cwvra" <i>iJerevwn</i></FONT> "Eleazar, a man <i>prominent among</i> <i>the priests</i> of the country"]; cf. also <i>Pss. Sol.</i> 17:30). When, however, an elative notion is found, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">en</FONT>) plus a personal plural dative is not uncommon (cf. <i>Pss. Sol.</i> 2:6). Although <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn</FONT> plus a personal dative does not indicate agency, in collocation with words of perception, (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn</FONT> plus) dative personal nouns are often used to show the recipients. In this instance, the idea would then be "well known <i>to</i> the apostles."<br>

The verse is omitted entirely in <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>46 <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>61 <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> A B C 1739 <i>et pauci</i>). The strength of the external evidence, combined with uncertainty in other MSS over where the verse should be located and the fact that it is a repetition of v. 20b, strongly favors omission of the verse. The present translation follows the standard critical Greek texts in omitting the verse number, a procedure also followed by a number of other modern translations.<br>
 <a name="fn535" href="rom.htm#fnB535"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tc </b> (16:25) There is a considerable degree of difference among the MSS regarding the presence and position of the doxology of 16:25-27. Five situations present themselves from the MS tradition. The doxology is found in the ancient witnesses in three separate locations: (1) here after 16:23 (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>61<sup>vid</sup><FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek"> &Iacute; </FONT>B C D a b vg syr<sup>p </sup>cop), (2) after 14:23 (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Y </FONT>209<sup>vid</sup> 1881 <i>Byz </i>m<sup>vid</sup> syr<sup>h</sup> Or<sup>lat mss</sup>), or (3) after 15:33 (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>46). The situation is further complicated in that some of the MSS have these verses in two places: (4) after 14:23 <i>and </i>after 16:23 (A P 33 104 2805 <i>et pauci</i>); or (5) after 14:23 <i>and </i>after 15:33 (1506). The uncertain position of the doxology might suggest that it was added by later scribes. But since the MSS containing the doxology are so early and widespread, it almost certainly belongs in Romans; it is only a question of where. Only two positions (after chapter 14 and at the end of the letter) deserve particular notice. The situation of the MSS showing the doxology in two places dates back to the 5th century. Later copyists, faced with the doxology in two different places in the MSS they knew, may have decided to copy the doxology in both places, since they were unwilling to consciously omit any text. Because the textual disruption of the doxology is so early, B. M. Metzger (<i>Textual Commentary</i>, 470) suggests two possibilities: either (1) that Paul may have sent two different copies of Romans--a copy lacking chapters 15 and 16 and a copy with the full text of the epistle as we now have it, or (2) through some scribal accident, some of the earliest MSS of the Pauline letters lacked chapters 15 and 16. Those MSS that lacked chapters 15-16 would naturally conclude with some kind of doxology after chapter 14. On the other hand, H. Gamble (<i>The Textual History of the Letter to the Romans</i>, 123-132) argues for the position of the doxology at 14:23, since to put the doxology at 16:25 would violate Paul's normal pattern of a grace-benediction at the close of a letter. Gamble further argues for the inclusion of 16:24, since the MSS that put the doxology after chapter 14 almost always present 16:24 as the letter's closing, whereas most of the MSS that put the doxology at its traditional position drop 16:24, perhaps because it would be redundant before 16:25-27. A decision is difficult, but the weight of external evidence, since it is both early and geographically widespread, suggests that the doxology belongs here after 16:23.
