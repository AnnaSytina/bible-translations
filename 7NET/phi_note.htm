 <b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Grk</i> "Paul." The word "from" is not in the Greek text, but has been supplied to indicate the sender of the letter.<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="phi.htm#fnB1" TARGET="text_pane"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  Traditionally, "servants" or "bondservants." Though <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dou'lo"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">doulos</FONT>) is normally translated "servant," the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BAGD notes that "`servant' for `slave' is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times...in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished" (BAGD 205 s.v.). The most accurate translation is "bondservant" (sometimes found in the ASV for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dou'lo"</FONT>), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:1)  Undoubtedly the background for the concept of being the Lord's slave or servant is to be found in the Old Testament scriptures. For a Jew this concept did not connote drudgery, but honor and privilege. It was used of national Israel at times (Isa 43:10), but was especially associated with famous OT personalities, including such great men as Moses (Joshua 14:7), David (Ps 89:3; cf. 2 Sam 7:5, 8) and Elijah (2 Kings 10:10); all these men were "servants (or slaves) of the Lord."<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="phi.htm#fnB2" TARGET="text_pane"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:1)  <i>The</i> <i>overseers </i>(or "church leaders," L&amp;N 53.71) is another term for the same official position of leadership as the "elder." This is seen in the interchange of the two terms in Titus 1:6-7 and in Acts 20:17, 28, as well as in the parallels between Titus 1:6-7 and 1 Tim 3:1-7.<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="phi.htm#fnB3" TARGET="text_pane"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  <i>Grk</i> "Grace to you and peace."<br>

 <a name="fn5" href="phi.htm#fnB5" TARGET="text_pane"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:5)  <i>Your participation </i>(<i>Grk</i> "fellowship") could refer to Paul rejoicing because of the Philippian converts' "fellowship" in the gospel along with him, but it is more likely that this refers to their active "participation" with him in the gospel by means of the financial support they sent to Paul on more than one occasion, discussed later in this letter (4:10-19, esp. 4:15-16).<br>
 <a name="fn6" href="phi.htm#fnB6" TARGET="text_pane"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  Several alternatives for translating vv. 3-5 are possible: (1) "I thank my God every time <i>I remember you</i>, yes, always in my every prayer for all of you. I pray with joy because of your participation..." (see NAB; also M. Silva, <i>Philippians</i> [BECNT], 43-44; G. D. Fee, <i>Philippians</i> [NICNT], 76-80); (2) "I thank my God because of <i>your every remembrance of me</i>. Always in my every prayer for all of you I pray with joy. [I am grateful] for your participation..." (see Moffatt; also P. T. O'Brien, <i>Philippians </i>[NIGTC], 58-61). Option (1) is quite similar to the translation above, but sees v. 4a as more or less parenthetical. Option (2) is significantly different in that Paul thanks God because the Philippians remember him rather than when he remembers them.<br>
 <a name="fn7" href="phi.htm#fnB7" TARGET="text_pane"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  <i>Grk</i> "since I am sure of this very thing." The verse begins with an adverbial participle that is dependent on the main verb in v. 3 ("I thank"). Paul here gives one reason for his thankfulness.<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="phi.htm#fnB8" TARGET="text_pane"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  The referent is clearly God from the overall context of the paragraph and the mention of "the day of Christ Jesus" at the end, which would be redundant if Christ were referred to here.<br>

 <a name="fn11" href="phi.htm#fnB11" TARGET="text_pane"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  <i>Grk</i> "Just as." The sense here is probably, "So I give thanks (v. 3) <i>just as</i> it is right for me..."<br>

 <a name="fn24" href="phi.htm#fnB24" TARGET="text_pane"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:14)  A number of significant MSS add "of God" here. Although <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tou' qeou'</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">tou qeou</FONT>) is amply supported in the Alexandrian and Western texts, the omission is difficult to explain as either an intentional deletion or unintentional oversight. To be sure, the pedigree of the witnesses is not nearly as great for the shorter reading (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>46<sup> </sup>D<sup>2 </sup>1739 1881 <i>Byz</i> <i>et alii</i>), but it explains well the rise of the other reading. As well, it explains the rise of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kurivou</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kuriou</FONT>), the reading of F and G (for if these MSS had followed a <i>Vorlage</i> with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tou' qeou'</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tou' kurivou </FONT>should not have been expected). Thus, the Byzantine text and a few other witnesses here have the superior reading and must be accepted as the original. As a sidenote, this reading illustrates both how reasoned eclecticism is approached (internal evidence often overrides external evidence, especially in places where it is a clear indicator) and that reasoned eclectics do not necessarily vilify the Byzantine text. On the other side, majority text/TR advocates often speak of the Alexandrian and Western traditions as corrupt, produced by heretics; many also speak against <i>brevior lectio</i> (the canon of the shorter reading) as though all shorter readings were produced by heretics who intended to chop up the text. Variants such as this cause such a stance to backfire (for there are over 600 Byzantine shorter readings in the NT).<br>
 <a name="fn25" href="phi.htm#fnB25" TARGET="text_pane"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:17)  Most MSS have <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tovn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ton</FONT>) before <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Cristovn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Criston</FONT>), in apparent assimilation to the wording of v. 15. However, the earliest and best witnesses lack the article (so <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT><sup>1</sup> B F G <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Y</FONT> 0278 1739 <i>et pauci</i>). Although it is possible that the omission of the article is due to homoioteleuton, both the fact that v. 17 is not parallel to v. 15 in the witnesses to such an omission and the fact that the MSS that omit are from different texttypes strongly suggests otherwise. There is, nevertheless, little (if any) translational difference between the two.<br>
 <a name="fn26" href="phi.htm#fnB26" TARGET="text_pane"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:17)  <i>Grk</i> "thinking to cause trouble to my bonds."<br>
 <a name="fn27" href="phi.htm#fnB27" TARGET="text_pane"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:18)  Or "But." The conjunction <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajllav </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">alla</FONT>) may be emphatic or contrastive. If the former, the idea may be that Paul will continue rejoicing because of the proclamation of the gospel or because of his imminent release from prison (v. 19); if the latter, Paul is now turning his attention solely to this second reason to rejoice, viz., that he will soon be released from prison. In this latter view the clause should be translated, "But I will also rejoice since I know..."<br>
 <a name="fn28" href="phi.htm#fnB28" TARGET="text_pane"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:19)  Or "salvation." Deliverance from prison (i.e., release) is probably what Paul has in view here, although some take this as a reference to his ultimate release from the body, i.e., dying and being with Christ (v. 23).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:19)  The phrase <i>this will turn out for my deliverance</i> may be an echo of Job 13:16 (LXX).<br>

 <a name="fn34" href="phi.htm#fnB34" TARGET="text_pane"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:22)  <i>Grk</i> "what I shall prefer."

Hence, there is the likelihood that he experienced a <i>second</i> Roman imprisonment later on (since the belief of the early church was that Paul died under Nero in Rome). If so, then the pastoral letters (1-2 Tim, Titus) could well fit into a life of Paul that goes beyond any descriptions in the book of Acts (which ends with Paul's first Roman imprisonment). Some have argued that the pastorals cannot be genuine because they cannot fit into the history of Acts. But this view presupposes that Paul's first Roman imprisonment was also his last.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (1:28)  Paul uses the dative "to them" (translated here as <i>their</i>) to describe the coming destruction of the gospel's enemies, but the genitive "your" to describe the believers' coming salvation. The dative accents what will happen <i>to the enemies</i> (called a dative of disadvantage [see D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax</i>, 143-44]), while the genitive accents what the believers will <i>possess</i> (and, in fact, <i>do already</i> possess, as v. 29 makes clear).<br>

These terms are used broadly to refer to the genre of writing, not to the content. There are two broad criteria for determining if a passage is poetic or hymnic: "(a) <i>stylistic:</i> a certain rhythmical lilt when the passages are read aloud, the presence of <i>parallelismus membrorum</i> (i.e., an arrangement into couplets), the semblance of some metre, and the presence of rhetorical devices such as alliteration, <i>chiasmus</i>, and antithesis; and (b) <i>linguistic: </i>an unusual vocabulary, particularly the presence of theological terms, which is different from the surrounding context" (P. T. O'Brien, <i>Philippians </i>[NIGTC], 188-9). Classifying a passage as hymnic or poetic is important because understanding this genre can provide keys to interpretation. However, not all scholars agree that the above criteria are present in this passage, so the decision to typeset it as poetry should be viewed as a tentative decision about its genre.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (2:7)  The expression <i>the likeness of men</i> is similar to Paul's wording in Rom 8:3 ("in the likeness of sinful flesh"). The same word "likeness" is used in both passages. It implies that there is a form that does not necessarily correspond to reality. In Rom 8:3, the meaning is that Christ <i>looked like</i> sinful humanity. Here the meaning is similar: Jesus <i>looked</i> <i>like</i> other <i>men</i> (note <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">anqrwpoi</FONT>), but was in fact different from them in that he did not have a sin nature.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (2:7)  <i>By sharing in human nature. </i>This last line of v. 7 (line d) stands in tension with the previous line, line c ("by looking like other men"). Both lines have a word indicating form or likeness. Line d, as noted above, implies that Christ only <i>appeared</i> to be like other people. Line d, however, uses a different term that implies a correspondence between form and reality. Further, line c uses the plural "men" while line d uses the singular "man." The theological point being made is that Christ looked just like other men, but he was not like other men (in that he was not sinful), though he was fully human.<br>

Howard, "The `Faith of Christ'," <i>ExpTim</i> 85 (1974): 212-15; R. B. Hays, <i>The Faith of Jesus Christ</i>; Morna D. Hooker, "<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Pivsti" Cristou'</FONT>," <i>NTS</i> 35 (1989): 321-42). Noteworthy among the arguments for the subjective genitive view is that when <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pivsti" </FONT>takes a personal genitive it is almost never an objective genitive (cf. Matt 9:2, 22, 29; Mark 2:5; 5:34; 10:52; Luke 5:20; 7:50; 8:25, 48; 17:19; 18:42; 22:32; Rom 1:8; 12; 3:3; 4:5, 12, 16; 1 Cor 2:5; 15:14, 17; 2 Cor 10:15; Phil 2:17; Col 1:4; 2:5; 1 Thess 1:8; 3:2, 5, 10; 2 Thess 1:3; Titus 1:1; Phlm 6; 1 Pet 1:9, 21; 2 Pet 1:5). <br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:9)  D. B. Wallace, who notes that the grammar is not decisive, nevertheless suggests that "the faith/faithfulness of Christ is not a denial of faith <i>in </i>Christ as a Pauline concept (for the idea is expressed in many of the same contexts, only with the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pisteuvw</FONT> rather than the noun), but implies that the object of faith is a worthy object, for he himself is faithful" (<i>Exegetical Syntax</i>, 116).

 <b>sn</b> (3:15)  The adjective <i>perfect</i> comes from the same root as the verb <i>perfected</i> in v. 12; Paul may well be employing a wordplay to draw in his opponents. Thus, <i>perfect</i> would then be in quotation marks and Paul would then argue that no one--neither they nor he--is in fact perfect. The thrust of vv. 1-16 is that human credentials can produce <i>nothing</i> that is pleasing to God (vv. 1-8). Instead of relying on such, Paul urges his readers to trust God for their righteousness (v. 9) rather than our own efforts, and at the same time to press on for the prize that awaits them (vv. 12-14). He argues further that perfection is unattainable in this life (v. 15), yet the level of maturity that one has reached should not for this reason be abandoned (v. 16).<br>
