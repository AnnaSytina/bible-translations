 <a name="fn1" href="col.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  <i>Grk </i>"and faithful." The construction in Greek (as well as Paul's style) suggests that the saints are identical to the faithful; hence, the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>) is best left untranslated (cf. Eph 1:1). See D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax</i>, 281-2.<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="col.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  <i>Grk</i> "brothers," but the Greek word may be used for "brothers and sisters" or "fellow Christians" as here (cf.

 <a name="fn4" href="col.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  The adverb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pavntote </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">pantote</FONT>) is understood to modify the indicative <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eujcaristou'men </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">eucaristoumen</FONT>) because it precedes <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">periV uJmw'n</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">peri Jumwn</FONT>) which probably modifies the indicative and not the participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">proseucovmenoi</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">proseucomenoi</FONT>). But see 1:9 where the same expression occurs and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">periV uJmw'n</FONT> modifies the participle "praying" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">proseucovmenoi</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="col.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  The adverbial participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajkouvsante"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">akousante"</FONT>) is understood to be temporal and translated with "since." A causal idea may also be in the apostle's mind, but the context emphasizes temporal ideas, e.g., "from the day" (v. 6).<br>
 <a name="fn6" href="col.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  Col 1:3-5 form one long sentence in the Greek text and have been divided between v. 4 and v. 5 for clarity, in keeping with the tendency in contemporary English toward shorter sentences. Thus the phrase "Your faith and love have arisen from the hope" is literally "because of the hope." The perfect tense "have arisen" was chosen in the English to reflect the fact that the recipients of the letter had acquired this hope at conversion in the past, but that it still remains and motivates them to trust in Christ and to love one another. <br>
 <a name="fn7" href="col.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  BAGD 92 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajpovkeimai</FONT> 2 renders <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajpokeimevnhn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">apokeimenhn</FONT>) with the expression "<i>laid up</i>" in this verse.<br>

 <a name="fn9" href="col.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  <i>Grk</i> "just as in the entire world it is bearing fruit." The antecedent ("the gospel") of the implied subject ("it") of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejstin </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">estin</FONT>) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="col.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  Though the participles are periphrastic with the present tense verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejstivn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">estin</FONT>), the presence of the temporal indicator "from the day" in the next clause indicates that this is a present tense that reaches into the past and should be translated as "has been bearing fruit and growing." For a discussion of this use of the present tense, see D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax,</i> 519-20.<br>
 <a name="fn11" href="col.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  Or "learned it." The Greek text simply has "you learned" without the reference to "the gospel," but "the gospel" is supplied to clarify the sense of the clause. Direct objects were frequently omitted in Greek when clear from the context.<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="col.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  The Greek word translated "fellow slave" is <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">suvndoulo"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">sundoulo"</FONT>); the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">suvn</FONT>- prefix here denotes association. Though <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dou'lo"</FONT> is normally translated "servant," the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BAGD notes that "`servant' for `slave' is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times...in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished" (BAGD 205 s.v.). The most accurate translation is "bondservant" (sometimes found in the ASV for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dou'lo"</FONT>), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="col.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  The Greek text has "<i>who </i>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o{"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jos</FONT>) is a faithful minister." The above translation conveys the antecedent of the relative pronoun quite well and avoids the redundancy with the following substantival participle of v. 8, namely, "who told" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJ dhlwvsa"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jo dhlwsa"</FONT>).<br>

Although it is possible that <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJmw'n</FONT> was an early alteration of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uJmw'n</FONT> (either unintentionally, as dittography, since it comes 17 letters after the previous <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJmw'n</FONT>; or intentionally, to conform to the surrounding first person pronouns), this supposition is more difficult to maintain in light of the varied and valuable witnesses for this reading. Further, the second person is both embedded in the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejmavqete</FONT> and is explicit in v. 8 (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uJmw'n</FONT>). Hence, the motivation to change to the first person pronoun is counterbalanced by such evidence. The second person pronoun may have been introduced unintentionally via homoioarcton with the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">uJpevr</FONT> that immediately precedes. Ultimately, the decision must be based on external evidence, and this overwhelmingly supports <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJmw'n.</FONT><br>
 <a name="fn15" href="col.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  The term "God" does not appear in the Greek text, but the following reference to "<i>his</i> knowledge" makes it clear that "God" is in view as the object of the "praying and asking," and should therefore be included in the English translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn16" href="col.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  The <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{na</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jina</FONT>) clause has been translated as substantival, indicating the content of the prayer and asking.

 <a name="fn23" href="col.htm#fnB23"><sup>24</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:15)  This passage has been typeset as poetry because many scholars regard this passage as poetic or hymnic. These terms are used broadly to refer to the genre of writing, not to the content. There are two broad criteria for determining if a passage is poetic or hymnic: "(a) <i>stylistic:</i> a certain rhythmical lilt when the passages are read aloud, the presence of <i>parallelismus membrorum</i> (i.e., an arrangement into couplets), the semblance of some metre, and the presence of rhetorical devices such as alliteration, <i>chiasmus</i>, and antithesis; and (b) <i>linguistic: </i>an unusual vocabulary, particularly the presence of theological terms, which is different from the surrounding context" (P. T. O'Brien, <i>Philippians </i>[NIGTC], 188-9). Classifying a passage as hymnic or poetic is important because understanding this genre can provide keys to interpretation. However, not all scholars agree that the above criteria are present in this passage, so the decision to typeset it as poetry should be viewed as a tentative decision about its genre.<br>
 <a name="fn24" href="col.htm#fnB24"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:15)  The Greek term <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">prwtovtoko"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">prwtotokos</FONT>) could refer either to first in order of time, such as a first born child, or it could refer to one who is preeminent in rank. M. J. Harris, <i>Colossians and Philemon </i>(EGGNT),<i> </i>43, expresses the meaning of the word well: "The `firstborn' was either the eldest child in a family or a person of preeminent rank. The use of this term to describe the Davidic king in Ps 88:28 LXX (=Ps 89:27 EVV), `I will also appoint him my firstborn (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">prwtovtokon</FONT>), the most exalted of the kings of the earth,' indicates that it can denote supremacy in rank as well as priority in time. But whether the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">prwtov</FONT>- element in the word denotes time, rank, or both, the significance of the -<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">toko" </FONT>element as indicating birth or origin (from <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tivktw</FONT>, give birth to) has been virtually lost except in ref. to lit. birth." In Col 1:15 the emphasis is on the priority of Jesus' rank as over and above creation (cf. 1:16 and the "for" clause referring to Jesus as Creator).<br>
 <a name="fn25" href="col.htm#fnB25"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:15)  The genitive construction <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pavsh" ktivsew"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">pash" ktisew"</FONT>) is a genitive of subordination and is therefore translated as "over all creation." See D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax, </i>103-104. <br>

 <a name="fn28" href="col.htm#fnB28"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:18)  See the note on the term "firstborn" in 1:15. Here the reference to Jesus as the "firstborn from among the dead" seems to be arguing for a chronological priority, i.e., Jesus was <i>the first </i>to rise from the dead.<br>
 <a name="fn29" href="col.htm#fnB29"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:18)  <i>Grk</i> "in order that he may become in all things, himself, first."<br>
 <a name="fn30" href="col.htm#fnB30"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:19)  The noun "God" does not appear in the Greek text, but since God is the one who reconciles the world to himself (cf. 2 Cor 5:19), he is clearly the subject of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eujdovkhsen</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">eudokhsen</FONT>).<br>

BAGD 319 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eujdokevw </FONT>1 translates the phrase as "all the fullness willed to dwell in him" thus leaving the referent as impersonal. Insofar as Paul is alluding to the so-called emanations from God this is acceptable. But the fact that "the fullness" dwells in a person (i.e., "in him") seems to argue for the translation "his fullness" where "his" refers to God.<br>
 <a name="fn32" href="col.htm#fnB32"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:19)  The aorist verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">katoikh'sai </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">katoikhsai</FONT>) could be taken as an ingressive, in which case it refers to the incarnation and may be translated as "begin to dwell, to take up residence." It is perhaps better, though, to take it as a constative aorist and simply a reference to the <i>fact </i>that the fullness of God dwells in Jesus Christ. This is a permanent dwelling, though, not a temporary one, as the present tense in 2:9 makes clear.<br>

This is evidenced by the fact that Paul has already referred to their faith as "orderly" and "firm" (2:5), despite the struggles of some of them with this deceptive heresy (cf. 2:16-23). The verb is used literally to refer to a person "walking" and is thus used metaphorically (i.e., ethically) to refer to the way a person lives his or her life.<br>
 <a name="fn61" href="col.htm#fnB61"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:7)  Or "having been rooted."<br>
 <a name="fn62" href="col.htm#fnB62"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:7)  The three participles <i>rooted</i>, <i>built up</i>, and <i>firm</i> belong together and reflect three different metaphors. The first participle "<i>rooted</i>" (perfect tense) indicates a settled condition on the part of the Colossian believers and refers to horticulture. The second participle "<i>built up</i>" (present passive) comes from the world of architecture. The third participle "<i>firm</i> [established]" (present passive) comes from the law courts. With these three metaphors (as well as the following comment on thankfulness) Paul explains what he means when he commands them to continue to live their lives in Christ. The use of the passive probably reflects God's activity among them. It was he who had rooted them, had been building them up, and had established them in the faith (cf. 1 Cor 3:5-15 for the use of mixed metaphors). <br>

The two nouns <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">filosofiva" </FONT>and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kenh'" </FONT>are joined by one article and probably form a hendiadys.

Originally it referred to the letters of the alphabet, with the idea at its root of "things in a row"; see C. Vaughn, "Colossians," <i>EBC</i> 11:198. M. J. Harris (<i>Colossians and Philemon </i>[EGGNT],<i> </i>93) outlines three probable options: (1) the material elements which comprise the physical world; (2) the elementary teachings of the world (so NEB, NASB, NIV); (3) the elemental spirits of the world (so NEB, RSV). The first option is highly unlikely because Paul is not concerned here with the physical elements, e.g., carbon or nitrogen. The last two options are both possible. Though the Gnostic-like heresy at Colossae would undoubtedly have been regarded by Paul as an "elementary teaching" at best, because the idea of "spirits" played such a role in Gnostic thought, he may very well have had in mind elemental spirits that operated in the world or controlled the world (i.e., under God's authority and permission).<br>

Again, as was stated in the note on 1:19, this is not a temporary dwelling, but a permanent one. Paul's point is polemical against the idea that the fullness of God dwells anywhere else, as the Gnostics believed, except in Christ alone. At the incarnation, the second person of the Trinity assumed humanity, and is forever the God-man.<br>

Paul says that they have put off the old man and have put on the new man. Two things need to be discussed in reference to Paul's statement. (1) What is the meaning of the clothing imagery (i.e., the "<i>have put off</i>" and "<i>have been clothed</i>")? (2) What is the meaning of the <i>old man </i>and the <i>new man</i>? Though some commentators understand the participles "<i>have put off</i>" (v. 9) and "<i>have been clothed</i>" (v. 10) as imperatives (i.e., "put off!" and "put on!"), this use of participles is extremely rare in the NT and thus unlikely here. It is better to take them as having the semantic force of indicatives, and thus they give an explanation of what had happened to the Colossians at the time of their conversion--they had taken off the <i>old man </i>and put on the <i>new </i>when they trusted in Christ (cf. 1:4). While it is difficult to say for certain what the background to Paul's "clothing" metaphor might be (whether it is primarily Jewish and comes from the OT, or primarily Gentile and comes from some facet of the Greco-Roman religious milieu), it is nonetheless clear, on the basis of Paul's usage of the expression, that the <i>old man </i>refers to man as he is in Adam and dominated by sin (cf. Rom 6:6; Eph 4:22), while the <i>new man </i>refers to the Christian whose new sphere of existence is in Christ. Though the metaphor of clothing oneself primarily reflects outward actions, there is a distinct inward aspect to it, as the rest of v. 10 indicates: <i>being renewed in knowledge according to the image of the one who created it</i>. Paul's point, then, is that Christians should take off their dirty clothing (inappropriate behavior) and put on clean clothing (behavior consistent with knowing Christ) because this has already been accomplished in a positional sense at the time of their conversion (cf. Gal 3:27 with Rom 13:14).<br>

 <a name="fn120" href="col.htm#fnB120"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:24)  The genitive <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">th'" klhronomiva" </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">th" klhronomia"</FONT>) is a genitive of apposition: the reward consists of the inheritance.<br>
 <a name="fn121" href="col.htm#fnB121"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:24)  The form of the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">douleuvete </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">douleuete</FONT>) is ambiguous; it can be read as either indicative or imperative. In favor of the indicative: (1) it seems to explain better the first part of v. 24, esp. "from the Lord" which would then read as: "because you know that you will receive your inheritance from the Lord as a reward <i>for</i> it is the Lord you are serving." The "for" is supplied to make the relation explicit (it is actually added in many MSS--D<sup>1</sup> <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Y </FONT>075 <i>Byz</i> <i>et pauci</i>--but the best MS evidence is against its inclusion). (2) With the imperative, one might expect <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">wJ" tw/' kurivw/</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jw" tw kuriw</FONT>),<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">/ </FONT>as for example in Eph 6:7. In favor of the imperative: (1) an imperative resumes the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejrgavzesqe </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ergazesqe</FONT>) in v. 23a and forms a chiasm with it; (2) an imperative makes more sense of the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">gavr </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">gar</FONT>) in v. 25a; (3) an imperative relates equally well to the preceding statement; (4) a parallel can be found in Rom 12:11 which uses an imperatival participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">douleuvonte" </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">douleuonte"</FONT>) with the dative <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tw/' kurivw/</FONT>. For an elaboration of these points see M. J. Harris, <i>Colossians and Philemon</i> (EGGNT),<i> </i>185-86. <br>
 <a name="fn122" href="col.htm#fnB122"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:25)  <i>Grk </i>"that which he did wrong."<br>
 <b>sn </b> (3:25) It is a common theme in biblical thought that punishment for sin involves being fully given over to its consequences (cf. Rom 1), and this is also true of believers. Here Paul's implication is that believers who sin and disobey the Lord whom they serve will receive the consequences of their actions, which is a fitting discipline.<br>
 <a name="fn123" href="col.htm#fnB123"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:25)  The Greek word used here is <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">proswpolhmyiva </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">proswpolhmyia</FONT>) and is usually translated "partiality." It is used to describe unjust or unrighteous favoritism (Rom 2:11, Eph 6:9, Jas 2:1). When it comes to disciplining his children for their sins, God will treat all equally with no partiality. <br>
 <a name="fn124" href="col.htm#fnB124"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:3)  Though <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">proseucovmenoi </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">proseucomenoi</FONT>) is a circumstantial participle related to the previous imperative, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">proskarterei'te</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">proskartereite</FONT>), it is here translated as an independent clause due to requirements of contemporary English style.<br>
 <a name="fn125" href="col.htm#fnB125"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:3)  The <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{na </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jina</FONT>) clause has been rendered as substantival here, indicating the content of the prayer rather than the purpose for it. These two ideas are very similar and difficult to differentiate in this passage, but the conjunction <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{na</FONT> following a verb of praying is generally regarded as giving the content of the prayer.<br>
 <a name="fn126" href="col.htm#fnB126"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:3)  <i>Grk </i>"that God may open for us a door of the word to speak the mystery of Christ." The construction in Greek is somewhat awkward in this clause. The translation attempts to simplify this structure somewhat and yet communicate exactly what Paul is asking for.<br>
 <a name="fn127" href="col.htm#fnB127"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:3)  Or "so that we may speak."<br>
 <a name="fn128" href="col.htm#fnB128"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:3)  Or "in prison."<br>
 <a name="fn129" href="col.htm#fnB129"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:4)  The phrase begins with the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{na </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jina</FONT>) clause and is subordinate to the imperative <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">proskarterei'te </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">proskartereite</FONT>) in v. 2. The reference to the idea that Paul must make it known indicates that this clause is probably best viewed as purpose and not content, like the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{na </FONT>of v. 3. It is the second purpose stated in the context; the first is expressed through the infinitive <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">lalh'sai </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">lalhsai</FONT>) in v. 3. The term "pray" at the beginning of the sentence is intended to pick up the imperative of v. 3.<br>
 <a name="fn130" href="col.htm#fnB130"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:5)  <i>Grk </i>"walk." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">peripatevw </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">peripatew</FONT>) is a common NT idiom for one's lifestyle, behavior, or manner of conduct (L&amp;N 41.11).<br>
 <a name="fn131" href="col.htm#fnB131"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:7)  See the note on "fellow slave" in 1:7.<br>
 <a name="fn132" href="col.htm#fnB132"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:7)  <i>Grk </i>"all things according to me."<br>
 <a name="fn133" href="col.htm#fnB133"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:8)  <i>Grk</i> "the things concerning us."<br>
 <a name="fn134" href="col.htm#fnB134"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:9)  The Greek sentence continues v. 9 with the phrase "with Onesimus," but this is awkward in English, so the verb "I sent" was inserted and a new sentence started at the beginning of v. 9 in the translation. <br>
 <a name="fn135" href="col.htm#fnB135"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:9)  <i>Grk</i> "is of you."<br>
 <a name="fn136" href="col.htm#fnB136"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:9)  <i>Grk</i> "will make known to you." This has been simplified in the translation to "will tell."<br>
 <a name="fn137" href="col.htm#fnB137"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:11)  <i>Grk</i> "those of the circumcision." The verse as a whole is difficult to translate because it is unclear whether Paul is saying (1) that the only people working with him are Jewish converts at the time the letter is being written or previously, or (2) that Aristarchus, Mark, and Jesus Justus were the only Jewish Christians who ever worked with him. Vv. 12-14 appear to indicate that Luke and Demas, who were Gentiles, were also working currently with Paul. This is the view adopted in the translation. See M. J. Harris, <i>Colossians and Philemon </i>(EGGNT), 207-208.<br>
 <a name="fn138" href="col.htm#fnB138"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:12)  See the note on "fellow slave" in 1:7.<br>
 <a name="fn139" href="col.htm#fnB139"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:12)  Strong Alexandrian testimony suggests that <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">*Ihsou'</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Ihsou</FONT>, "Jesus") follows <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Cristou'</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Cristou</FONT>, "Christ"; so <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> A B C I L 33 81 2464 <i>et alii</i>), but the evidence for the shorter reading is diverse (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT><sup>46 </sup>D F G <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Y</FONT> 075 1739 1881 <i>Byz</i> it syr Jerome<i> et alii</i>), cutting across all major texttypes. There can be little motivation for omitting the name of Jesus; hence, the shorter reading is judged to be original.<br>
 <a name="fn140" href="col.htm#fnB140"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:12)  Or "filled."<br>
 <a name="fn141" href="col.htm#fnB141"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:13)  <i>Grk</i> "pain." This word appears only three times in the NT outside of this verse (Rev 16:10, 11; 21:4) where the translation "pain" makes sense. For the present verse it is translated "worked hard." See BAGD 691 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">povno" </FONT>1.<br>
 <a name="fn142" href="col.htm#fnB142"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:15)  <i>Grk</i> "brothers." See note on the phrase "brothers and sisters" in 1:2.<br>
 <a name="fn143" href="col.htm#fnB143"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:15)  <i>Grk</i> "the church in her house." The meaning is that Paul sends greetings to the church that meets at Nympha's house.<br>
 <a name="fn144" href="col.htm#fnB144"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:16)  <i>Grk</i> "when."<br>
 <a name="fn145" href="col.htm#fnB145"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:16)  The construction beginning with the imperative <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">poihvsate i{na</FONT>...<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajnagnwsqh'/ </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">poihsate Jina</FONT>...<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">anagnwsqh</FONT>) should be translated as "have it read" where the conjunction <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">i{na</FONT> functions to mark off its clause as the direct object of the imperative <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">poihvsate</FONT>. The content of the clause ("reading the letter") is what Paul commands with the imperative <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">poihvsate</FONT>. Thus the translation "have it read" has been used here.<br>
 <a name="fn146" href="col.htm#fnB146"><sup>35</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:16)  This letter is otherwise unknown, but some have suggested that it is the letter known today as Ephesians.<br>
