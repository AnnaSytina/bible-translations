<p><A NAME="1"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> From Paul,<a name="fnB0" href="1co_note.htm#fn0"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Sosthenes, our brother, 
<bqverse 2>2  to the church of God that is in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, and called to be saints, with all those in every place who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours.<a name="fnB1" href="1co_note.htm#fn1"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 3>3  Grace and peace to you<a name="fnB2" href="1co_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!<a name="_Toc403221819"></a><a name="_Toc416894306"></a><a name="_Toc432265169"></a><a name="_Toc485060110"></a><a name="_Toc494013607"></a></p>
<p><i>Thanksgiving</i>
<p>
<bqverse 4>4  I always thank my God for you because of the grace of God that was given to you in Christ Jesus. 
<bqverse 5>5  For you were made rich<a name="fnB3" href="1co_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> in every way in him, in all your speech and in every kind of knowledge<a name="fnB4" href="1co_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a>-- 
<bqverse 6>6  just as the testimony about Christ has been confirmed among you-- 
<bqverse 7>7  so that you do not lack any spiritual gift as you wait for the revelation<a name="fnB5" href="1co_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
<bqverse 8>8  He<a name="fnB6" href="1co_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> will also strengthen you to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
<bqverse 9>9  God is faithful, by whom you were called into fellowship with his son, Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name="_Toc403221820"></a><a name="_Toc416894307"></a><a name="_Toc432265170"></a><a name="_Toc485060111"></a><a name="_Toc494013608"></a></p>
<p><i>Divisions in the Church</i>
<p>
<bqverse 10>10  I urge you,<b> </b>brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB7" href="1co_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to agree together,<a name="fnB8" href="1co_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> to end your divisions,<a name="fnB9" href="1co_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and to be united by the same mind and purpose.<a name="fnB10" href="1co_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 11>11  For members of Chloe's household have made it clear to me, my brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB11" href="1co_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> that there are quarrels<a name="fnB12" href="1co_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> among you. 
<bqverse 12>12  Now I mean this, that<a name="fnB13" href="1co_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> each of you is saying, "I am with Paul," or "I am with Apollos," or "I am with Cephas," or "I am with Christ." 
<bqverse 13>13  Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of Paul? 
<bqverse 14>14  I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius, 
<bqverse 15>15  so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name! 
<bqverse 16>16  (I also baptized the household of Stephanus. Otherwise, I do not remember whether I baptized anyone else.) 
<bqverse 17>17  For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel--and not with clever speech, so that the cross of Christ would not become useless.<a name="fnB14" href="1co_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a><b> <a name="_Toc403221821"></a><a name="_Toc416894308"></a><a name="_Toc432265171"></a><a name="_Toc485060112"></a><a name="_Toc494013609"></a></b></p>
<p><i>The Message of the Cross</i>
<p>
<bqverse 18>18  For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 
<bqverse 19>19  For it is written, "<b><i>I will destroy the wisdom of the wise</i></b><i>,<b> and I will thwart the cleverness of the intelligent</b></i>."<a name="fnB15" href="1co_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  Where is the wise man? Where is the expert in the Mosaic law?<a name="fnB16" href="1co_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> Where is the debater of this age? Has God not made the wisdom of the world foolish? 
<bqverse 21>21  For since in the wisdom of God, the world by its wisdom did not know God, God was pleased to save those who believe by the foolishness of preaching. 
<bqverse 22>22  For Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks ask for wisdom, 
<bqverse 23>23  but we preach about a crucified Christ,<a name="fnB17" href="1co_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles.
<bqverse 24>24  But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. 
<bqverse 25>25  For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength. <p>

<bqverse 26>26  Think about the circumstances of your call,<a name="fnB18" href="1co_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> brothers and sisters.<a name="fnB19" href="1co_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> Not many were wise by human standards,<a name="fnB20" href="1co_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> not many were powerful, not many were members of the upper class.<a name="fnB21" href="1co_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  But God chose what the world thinks foolish to shame the wise, and God chose what the world thinks weak to shame the strong. 
<bqverse 28>28  God chose<a name="fnB22" href="1co_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> what is low and despised in the world, what is regarded as nothing, to set aside what is regarded as something, 
<bqverse 29>29  so that no one can boast in his presence. 
<bqverse 30>30  He is the reason you have a relationship with Christ Jesus,<a name="fnB23" href="1co_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption, 
<bqverse 31>31  so that, as it is written, "<b><i>Let the one who boasts</i></b><i>,<b> boast in the Lord</b></i>."<a name="fnB24" href="1co_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqchapter 2><A NAME="2"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> When I came<a name="fnB25" href="1co_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> to you, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB26" href="1co_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> I did not come with superior eloquence or wisdom as I proclaimed the testimony<a name="fnB27" href="1co_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> of God. 
<bqverse 2>2  For I decided to be concerned about nothing<a name="fnB28" href="1co_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> among you except Jesus Christ, as one who had been crucified. 
<bqverse 3>3  And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling. 
<bqverse 4>4  My conversation and my preaching were not with persuasive words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power, 
<bqverse 5>5  so that your faith would not be based on human wisdom but on the power of God.<a name="_Toc403221822"></a><a name="_Toc416894309"></a><a name="_Toc432265172"></a><a name="_Toc485060113"></a><a name="_Toc494013610"></a></p>
<p><i>Wisdom from God</i>
<p>
<bqverse 6>6  Now we do speak wisdom among the mature,<a name="fnB29" href="1co_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> but not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are perishing. 
<bqverse 7>7  Instead we speak the wisdom of God, hidden in a mystery, that God determined before the ages for our glory. 
<bqverse 8>8 None of the rulers of this age understood it. If they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 
<bqverse 9>9  But just as it is written, "<b><i>Things that no eye has seen</i></b><i>,<b> or ear heard</b>,<b> or mind imagined</b>,</i><a name="fnB30" href="1co_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> are the things God has prepared for those who love him</i></b><i>.</i>"<a name="fnB31" href="1co_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 10>10  God has revealed these to us by the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.
<bqverse 11>11  For who among men knows the things of a man except the man's spirit within him? So too, no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. 
<bqverse 12>12  Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things that are freely given to us by God.
<bqverse 13>13  And we speak about these things, not with words taught us by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things to spiritual people.<a name="fnB32" href="1co_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 14>14  The unbeliever<a name="fnB33" href="1co_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him. And he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.
<bqverse 15>15  The one who is spiritual discerns all things, yet he himself is understood<a name="fnB34" href="1co_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> by no one. 
<bqverse 16>16  <b><i>For who has known the mind of the Lord</i></b><i>,<b> so as to advise him?</b></i><a name="fnB35" href="1co_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> But we have the mind of Christ.

<p><i>Divisions in the Church</i>
<p><A NAME="3"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> So, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB36" href="1co_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> I could not speak to you as spiritual people, but instead as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ. 
<bqverse 2>2  I fed you milk,<a name="fnB37" href="1co_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> not solid food, for you were not yet ready. In fact, you are still not ready, 
<bqverse 3>3  for you are still influenced by the flesh. For since there is still jealousy and dissension among you, are you not influenced by the flesh and behaving like ordinary people?<a name="fnB38" href="1co_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  For whenever someone says, "I am with Paul," or "I am with Apollos," are you not typical people?<a name="fnB39" href="1co_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 5>5  What is Apollos, really? Or what is Paul? Servants through whom you came to believe, and each of us in the ministry the Lord gave us.<a name="fnB40" href="1co_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  I planted,<a name="fnB41" href="1co_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> Apollos watered, but God caused it to grow. 
<bqverse 7>7  So neither the one who plants counts for anything,<a name="fnB42" href="1co_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> nor the one who waters, but God who causes the growth. 
<bqverse 8>8  The one who plants and the one who waters are united, but each will receive his reward according to his work. 
<bqverse 9>9  We are coworkers belonging to God.<a name="fnB43" href="1co_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> You are God's field, God's building. 
<bqverse 10>10  According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master-builder I laid a foundation, but someone else builds on it. And each one must be careful how he builds. 
<bqverse 11>11  For no one can lay any foundation other than what is being laid, which is Jesus Christ. 
<bqverse 12>12  If anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,<a name="fnB44" href="1co_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  each builder's work will be plainly seen, for the Day<a name="fnB45" href="1co_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> will make it clear, because it will be revealed by fire.<a name="fnB46" href="1co_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> And the fire will test what kind of work each has done. 
<bqverse 14>14  If what someone has built survives, he will receive a reward. 
<bqverse 15>15  If someone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss.<a name="fnB47" href="1co_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> He himself will be saved, but only as through fire. <p>

<bqverse 16>16  Do you not know that you are God's temple<a name="fnB48" href="1co_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> and that God's Spirit lives in you? 
<bqverse 17>17  If someone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For God's temple is holy, which is what you are.<p>

<bqverse 18>18  Guard against self-deception, each of you.<a name="fnB49" href="1co_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> If someone among you thinks he is wise in this age, let him become foolish so that he can become wise. 
<bqverse 19>19  For the wisdom of this age is foolishness with God. As it is written, "<b><i>He catches the wise in their craftiness</i></b>."<a name="fnB50" href="1co_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  And again, "<b><i>The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise</i></b><i>,<b> that they are futile</b></i>."<a name="fnB51" href="1co_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  So then, no more boasting about mere mortals!<a name="fnB52" href="1co_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> For everything belongs to you, 
<bqverse 22>22  whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future. Everything belongs to you, 
<bqverse 23>23  and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.

<p><i>The Apostles' Ministry </i>
<p><A NAME="4"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> People should think about us this way--as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. 
<bqverse 2>2  Now what is sought in stewards is that one be found faithful. 
<bqverse 3>3  So for me, it is a minor matter that I am judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself. 
<bqverse 4>4  For I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not acquitted because of this. The one who judges me is the Lord. 
<bqverse 5>5  So then, do not judge anything before the time. Wait until the Lord comes. He will<a name="fnB53" href="1co_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the motives of hearts. Then each will receive recognition<a name="fnB54" href="1co_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> from God.<p>

<bqverse 6>6  I have applied these things to myself and Apollos because of you, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB55" href="1co_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> so that through us you may learn "not to go beyond what is written," so that none of you will be puffed up in favor of the one against the other. 
<bqverse 7>7  For who concedes you any superiority? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you received it, why do you boast as though you did not? 
<bqverse 8>8  Already you are satisfied! Already you are rich! You have become kings without us! I wish you had become kings so that we could reign with you! 
<bqverse 9>9  For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles last of all, as men condemned to die, because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to people. 
<bqverse 10>10  We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are distinguished, we are dishonored! 
<bqverse 11>11  To the present hour we are hungry and thirsty, poorly clothed, brutally treated and without a roof over our heads. 
<bqverse 12>12  We do hard work, toiling with our own hands. When we are verbally abused, we respond with a blessing, when persecuted, we endure, 
<bqverse 13>13  when people lie about us, we answer in a friendly manner. We are the world's dirt and scum, even now.<a name="_Toc403221825"></a><a name="_Toc416894312"></a><a name="_Toc432265175"></a><a name="_Toc485060116"></a><a name="_Toc494013613"></a></p>
<p><i>A Father's Warning</i>
<p>
<bqverse 14>14  I am not writing these things to shame you, but to correct you as my dear children. 
<bqverse 15>15  For though you may have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, because I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel. 
<bqverse 16>16  I encourage you, then, be imitators of me.
<bqverse 17>17  For this reason, I have sent Timothy to you, who is my dear and faithful son in the Lord. He will remind you of my ways in Christ,<a name="fnB56" href="1co_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> as I teach them everywhere in every church. 
<bqverse 18>18  Some have become puffed up, as if I were not coming to you. 
<bqverse 19>19  But I will come to you soon, if the Lord is willing, and I will find out not only the talk of these arrogant people, but also their power. 
<bqverse 20>20  For the kingdom of God is demonstrated not in idle talk but with power. 
<bqverse 21>21  What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod of discipline<a name="fnB57" href="1co_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> or with love and a spirit of gentleness?

<p><i>Church Discipline</i>
<p><A NAME="5"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>It is actually reported that sexual immorality exists among you, the kind of immorality that is not permitted even among the Gentiles, so that someone is cohabiting with<a name="fnB58" href="1co_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> his father's wife. 
<bqverse 2>2 And you are proud!<a name="fnB59" href="1co_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> Shouldn't you have been deeply sorrowful instead and removed the one who did this<a name="fnB60" href="1co_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> from among you? 
<bqverse 3>3  For even though I am absent physically,<a name="fnB61" href="1co_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> I am present in spirit. And I have already judged the one who did this, just as though I were present.<a name="fnB62" href="1co_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  When you gather together in the name of our Lord Jesus, and I am with you in spirit,<a name="fnB63" href="1co_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> along with the power of our Lord Jesus, 
<bqverse 5>5  turn this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved<a name="fnB64" href="1co_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> in the day of the Lord.<a name="fnB65" href="1co_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 6>6  Your boasting is not good.

<bqverse 7>7 Clean out the old yeast so that you may be a new batch of dough, since you are, in fact, without yeast.<b> </b>For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. 
<bqverse 8>8  So then, let us celebrate the festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of vice and evil, but with the bread without yeast, the bread of sincerity and truth.<a name="fnB68" href="1co_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc403221826"></a><a name="_Toc416894314"></a><a name="_Toc432265177"></a><a name="_Toc485060118"></a><a name="_Toc494013615"></a></p>
<p><i>Correcting a Misunderstanding </i>
<p>
<bqverse 9>9  I wrote you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people.

<p><i>Lawsuits</i>
<p><A NAME="6"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> When any of you has a legal dispute with another, does he dare go to court before the unrighteous rather than before the saints? 
<bqverse 2>2  Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you not competent to settle trivial suits? 
<bqverse 3>3  Do you not know that we will judge angels? Why not ordinary matters! 
<bqverse 4>4  So if you have ordinary lawsuits, do you appoint as judges those who have no standing in the church?<a name="fnB72" href="1co_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  I say this to your shame! Is there no one among you wise enough to settle disputes between fellow Christians?<a name="fnB73" href="1co_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  Instead, does a Christian sue a Christian,<a name="fnB74" href="1co_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> and do this before unbelievers? 
<bqverse 7>7  The fact that you have lawsuits among yourselves demonstrates that you have already been defeated. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?

<bqverse 9>9  Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived!

<p><i>Flee Sexual Immorality</i>
<p>
<bqverse 12>12 "All things are lawful for me"--but not everything is beneficial. "All things are lawful for me"--but I will not be controlled by anything. 
<bqverse 13>13  "Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food"<a name="fnB80" href="1co_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a>--but God will do away with both.<a name="fnB81" href="1co_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> The body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. 
<bqverse 14>14  Now God indeed raised the Lord and he will raise us by his power. 
<bqverse 15>15  Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Should I take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!
<bqverse 16>16  Or do you not know that anyone who is united with<a name="fnB82" href="1co_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> a prostitute is one body with her?<a name="fnB83" href="1co_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> For it is said, "<b><i>The two will become one flesh</i></b>."<a name="fnB84" href="1co_note.htm#fn84"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 18>18  Flee sexual immorality! Every sin a person commits is outside of the body, but the immoral person sins against his own body. 
<bqverse 19>19  Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?
<bqverse 20>20  For you were bought with a price. Therefore glorify God with your body.

<p><i>Celibacy and Marriage</i>
<p><A NAME="7"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Now with regard to the issues you wrote about: "It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman."<a name="fnB87" href="1co_note.htm#fn87"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  But because of immoralities, each man should have<a name="fnB88" href="1co_note.htm#fn88"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> his own wife and each woman her own husband. 
<bqverse 3>3  A husband should give to his wife her sexual rights,<a name="fnB89" href="1co_note.htm#fn89"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> and likewise a wife to her husband.
<bqverse 4>4 It is not the wife who has the rights to her own body, but the husband. In the same way, it is not the husband who has the rights to his own body, but the wife. 
<bqverse 5>5  Do not deprive each other, except by agreement for a definite time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then resume your relationship,<a name="fnB90" href="1co_note.htm#fn90"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
<bqverse 6>6  I say this as a concession, not as a command.
<bqverse 7>7 I wish that everyone was as I am. But each has his own gift from God, one this way, another that.<p>

<bqverse 8>8  To the unmarried and widows I say that it is best for them to remain as I am. 
<bqverse 9>9  But if they do not have self-control, let them get married. For it is better to marry than to burn with sexual desire.<a name="fnB91" href="1co_note.htm#fn91"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 10>10  To the married I give this command--not I, but the Lord<a name="fnB92" href="1co_note.htm#fn92"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a>--a wife should not divorce a husband, 
<bqverse 11>11  (but if she does, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband), and a husband should not divorce his wife.<p>

<bqverse 12>12  To the rest I say--I, not the Lord<a name="fnB93" href="1co_note.htm#fn93"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a>--if a brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is happy to live with him, he should not divorce her.
<bqverse 13>13  And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is happy to live with her, she should not divorce him. 
<bqverse 14>14  For the unbelieving husband is sanctified because of the wife, and the unbelieving wife because of her husband. Otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy.
<bqverse 15>15  But if the unbeliever wants a divorce, let it take place. In these circumstances the brother or sister is not bound.<a name="fnB94" href="1co_note.htm#fn94"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> God has called you in peace.
<bqverse 16>16  For how do you know, wife, whether you will bring your husband to salvation?<a name="fnB95" href="1co_note.htm#fn95"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> Or how do you know, husband, whether you will bring your wife to salvation?<a name="fnB96" href="1co_note.htm#fn96"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc403221830"></a><a name="_Toc416894318"></a><a name="_Toc432265181"></a><a name="_Toc485060122"></a><a name="_Toc494013619"></a></p>
<p><i>Bloom Where You're Planted</i>
<p>
<bqverse 17>17  Only,<a name="fnB97" href="1co_note.htm#fn97"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> as the Lord has assigned to each one, as God has called each person, so let him live. I give this sort of direction in all the churches. 
<bqverse 18>18  Was anyone called after he had been circumcised? He should not try to hide the fact.<a name="fnB98" href="1co_note.htm#fn98"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> Was anyone called who is uncircumcised? He should not get circumcised.
<bqverse 19>19  Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Instead, keeping God's commandments is what counts. 
<bqverse 20>20  Let each one remain in that situation in life<a name="fnB99" href="1co_note.htm#fn99"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> in which he was called. 
<bqverse 21>21  Were you called as a slave?<a name="fnB100" href="1co_note.htm#fn100"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> Do not worry about it. But if indeed you are able to be free, make the most of the opportunity. 
<bqverse 22>22  For the one who was called in the Lord as a slave is the Lord's freedman. In the same way, the one who was called as a free person is Christ's slave. 
<bqverse 23>23  You were bought with a price. Do not become slaves of men. 
<bqverse 24>24  In whatever situation someone was called, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB101" href="1co_note.htm#fn101"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> let him remain in it with God.<a name="_Toc403221831"></a><a name="_Toc416894319"></a><a name="_Toc432265182"></a><a name="_Toc485060123"></a><a name="_Toc494013620"></a></p>
<p><i>Remaining Unmarried </i>
<p>
<bqverse 25>25  With regard to the question about people who have never married,<a name="fnB102" href="1co_note.htm#fn102"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> I have no command from the Lord, but I give my opinion as one shown mercy by the Lord to be trustworthy. 
<bqverse 26>26  Because of the impending crisis I think it best for you to remain as you are. 
<bqverse 27>27  The one bound to a wife should not seek divorce. The one released from a wife should not seek marriage.<a name="fnB103" href="1co_note.htm#fn103"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  But if you marry, you have not sinned. And if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face difficult circumstances,<a name="fnB104" href="1co_note.htm#fn104"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and I am trying to spare you. 
<bqverse 29>29  And I say this, brothers and sisters:<a name="fnB105" href="1co_note.htm#fn105"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> the time is short. So then those who have wives should be as those who have none, 
<bqverse 30>30  those with tears like those not weeping, those who rejoice like those not rejoicing, those who buy like those without possessions, 
<bqverse 31>31  those who use the world as though they were not using it to the full. For the present shape of this world is passing away.<b> </b><p>

<bqverse 32>32  And I want you to be free from concern. The unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord. 
<bqverse 33>33  But the married man is concerned about the things of the world, how to please his wife, 
<bqverse 34>34  and he is divided. An unmarried woman and virgin is concerned about the things of the Lord, to be holy both in body and spirit. But the married woman is concerned about the things of the world, how to please her husband. 
<bqverse 35>35  I am saying this for your benefit, not to place a limitation on you, but so that without distraction you may give notable and constant service to the Lord.<p>

<bqverse 36>36  If anyone thinks he is acting inappropriately toward his virgin,<a name="fnB106" href="1co_note.htm#fn106"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> if she is past the bloom of youth<a name="fnB107" href="1co_note.htm#fn107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> and it seems necessary, he should do what he wishes; he does not sin. Let them marry. 
<bqverse 37>37  But the man who is firm in his commitment, and is under no necessity but has control over his will, and has decided in his own mind to keep his own virgin, does well. 
<bqverse 38>38  So then, the one who marries<a name="fnB108" href="1co_note.htm#fn108"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> his own virgin does well, but the one who does not, does better.<a name="fnB109" href="1co_note.htm#fn109"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 39>39  A wife is bound as long as her husband is living. But if her husband dies,<a name="fnB110" href="1co_note.htm#fn110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> she is free to marry anyone she wishes (only someone in the Lord). 
<bqverse 40>40  But in my opinion, she will be happier if she remains as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God!

<p><i>Food Sacrificed to Idols</i>
<p><A NAME="8"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> With regard to food sacrificed to idols, we know that "we all have knowledge."<a name="fnB111" href="1co_note.htm#fn111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. 
<bqverse 2>2  If someone thinks he knows something, he does not yet know to the degree that he needs to know. 
<bqverse 3>3  But if someone loves God, he<a name="fnB112" href="1co_note.htm#fn112"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> is known by God.<a name="fnB113" href="1co_note.htm#fn113"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 4>4  With regard then to eating food sacrificed to idols, we know that "an idol in this world is nothing," and that "there is no God but one."<a name="fnB114" href="1co_note.htm#fn114"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  If after all there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords), 
<bqverse 6>6  yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we live, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we live.<a name="fnB115" href="1co_note.htm#fn115"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 7>7  But this knowledge is not shared by all. And some by being accustomed to idols in former times eat this food as an idol sacrifice, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. 
<bqverse 8>8  Now food will not bring us close to God. We are no worse if we do not eat and no better if we do. 
<bqverse 9>9  But be careful that this liberty of yours does not become a hindrance to the weak.
<bqverse 10>10  For if someone weak sees you<b> </b>who possess knowledge dining in an idol's temple, will not his conscience be "strengthened"<a name="fnB116" href="1co_note.htm#fn116"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> to eat food offered to idols? 
<bqverse 11>11  So by your knowledge the weak brother or sister,<a name="fnB117" href="1co_note.htm#fn117"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> for whom Christ died, is destroyed.<a name="fnB118" href="1co_note.htm#fn118"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  If you sin against your brothers or sisters<a name="fnB119" href="1co_note.htm#fn119"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. 
<bqverse 13>13  For this reason, if food causes my brother or sister to sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I may not cause one of them<a name="fnB120" href="1co_note.htm#fn120"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> to sin.

<p><i>The Rights of an Apostle</i>
<p><A NAME="9"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord? 
<bqverse 2>2  If I am not an apostle to others, at least I am to you, for you are the confirming sign of my apostleship in the Lord. 
<bqverse 3>3  This is my defense to those who examine me. 
<bqverse 4>4  Do we not have the right to financial support?<a name="fnB121" href="1co_note.htm#fn121"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 5>5  Do we not have the right to the company of a believing wife, like the other apostles and the Lord's brothers and Cephas? 
<bqverse 6>6  Or do only Barnabas and I lack the right not to work? 
<bqverse 7>7  Who ever serves in the army at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit? Who tends a flock and does not consume its milk? 
<bqverse 8>8  Am I saying these things only on the basis of common sense,<a name="fnB122" href="1co_note.htm#fn122"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> or does the law not say this as well? 
<bqverse 9>9  For it is written in the law of Moses, "<b><i>Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain</i></b>."<a name="fnB123" href="1co_note.htm#fn123"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> God is not concerned here about oxen is he?
<bqverse 10>10  Or is he not surely speaking for our benefit? It was written for us, because the one plowing and threshing ought to work in hope of enjoying the harvest. 
<bqverse 11>11  If we sowed spiritual blessings among you, is it too much to reap material things from you? 
<bqverse 12>12  If others receive this right from you, are we not more deserving? <p>
But we have not made use of this right. Instead we endure everything so that we may not be a hindrance to the gospel of Christ.
<bqverse 13>13  Do you not know that those providing services in the temple<a name="fnB124" href="1co_note.htm#fn124"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> eat food from the temple, those who serve at the altar receive a part of the offerings?
<bqverse 14>14  In the same way the Lord commanded those proclaiming the gospel to receive their living by the gospel. 
<bqverse 15>15  But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing these things so that something will be done for me.<a name="fnB125" href="1co_note.htm#fn125"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> In fact, it would be better for me to die than--no one will deprive me of my reason for boasting!<a name="fnB126" href="1co_note.htm#fn126"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  For if I preach the gospel, I have no reason for boasting because I am compelled to do this. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! 
<bqverse 17>17  For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward. But if unwillingly, I am entrusted with a responsibility. 
<bqverse 18>18  What then is my reward? That when I preach the gospel I may do it for free, and so not make full use of my rights in the gospel.<p>

<bqverse 19>19  For since I am free from all I can make myself a slave to all, in order to gain even more.
<bqverse 20>20  To the Jews I became like a Jew to gain the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law) to gain those under the law. 
<bqverse 21>21  To those free from the law I became like one free from the law (though I am not free from God's law but under the law of Christ) to gain those free from the law. 
<bqverse 22>22  To the weak I became weak in order to gain the weak. I have become all things to all people, so that by all means I may save some. <p>

<bqverse 23>23  I do all these things because of the gospel, so that I can be a participant in it.<p>

<bqverse 24>24  Do you not know that all the runners in a stadium compete, but only one receives the prize? So run to win.
<bqverse 25>25  Each competitor must exercise self-control in everything. They do it to receive a perishable crown, but we an imperishable one. <p>

<bqverse 26>26  So I do not run uncertainly or box like one who hits only air. 
<bqverse 27>27  Instead I subdue my body and make it my slave, so that after preaching to others I myself will not be disqualified.

<p><i>Avoid Idol Feasts</i>
<p>
<bqverse 14>14  So then, my dear friends, flee from idolatry. 
<bqverse 15>15  I am speaking to thoughtful people. Consider what I say.
<bqverse 16>16  Is not the cup of blessing that we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread that we break a sharing in the body of Christ? 
<bqverse 17>17  Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all share the one bread. 
<bqverse 18>18  Look at the people of Israel.<a name="fnB137" href="1co_note.htm#fn137"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> Are not those who eat the sacrifices partners in the altar? 
<bqverse 19>19  Am I saying that idols or food sacrificed to them amount to anything? 
<bqverse 20>20  No, I mean that what people sacrifice<a name="fnB138" href="1co_note.htm#fn138"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> is to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be partners with demons. 
<bqverse 21>21  You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot take part in the table of the Lord and the table of demons. 
<bqverse 22>22  Or are we trying to provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we really stronger than he is?<a name="fnB139" href="1co_note.htm#fn139"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc403221836"></a><a name="_Toc416894324"></a><a name="_Toc432265187"></a><a name="_Toc485060128"></a><a name="_Toc494013625"></a></p>
<p><i>Live to Glorify God</i>
<p>
<bqverse 23>23  "Everything is lawful," but not everything is beneficial. "Everything is lawful,"<a name="fnB140" href="1co_note.htm#fn140"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> but not everything builds others up.<a name="fnB141" href="1co_note.htm#fn141"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 24>24  Do not seek your own good, but the good of the other person. 
<bqverse 25>25  Eat anything that is sold in the marketplace without questions of conscience, 
<bqverse 26>26  for <i>the earth is the Lord's and its abundance</i>.<a name="fnB142" href="1co_note.htm#fn142"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 27>27  If an unbeliever invites you to dinner and you want to go, eat whatever is served without asking questions of conscience. 
<bqverse 28>28  But if someone says to you, "This is from a sacrifice," do not eat, because of the one who told you and because of conscience-- 
<bqverse 29>29  I do not mean yours but the other person's. For why is my right being judged by another's conscience? 
<bqverse 30>30  If I partake with thankfulness, why am I blamed for the food<a name="fnB143" href="1co_note.htm#fn143"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> that I give thanks for? 
<bqverse 31>31  So whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God. 
<bqverse 32>32  Do not give offense to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God, 
<bqverse 33>33  just as I also try to please everyone in all things. I do not seek my own benefit, but that of many, so that they may be saved. 
<bqchapter 11><A NAME="11"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ.<a name="_Toc403221837"></a><a name="_Toc416894325"></a><a name="_Toc432265188"></a><a name="_Toc485060129"></a><a name="_Toc494013626"></a></p>
<p><i>Women's Head Coverings</i>
<p>
<bqverse 2>2  I praise you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions just as I passed them on to you.
<bqverse 3>3  But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ. 
<bqverse 4>4  Any man who prays or prophesies with his head covered disgraces his head. 
<bqverse 5>5  But any woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered disgraces her head, for it is one and the same thing as having a shaved head. 
<bqverse 6>6  For if a woman will not cover her head, she should cut off her hair. But if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or be shaved, she should cover her head. 
<bqverse 7>7  For a man should not have his head covered, since he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of the man. 
<bqverse 8>8  For man did not come from woman, but woman from man. 
<bqverse 9>9  Neither was man created for the sake of woman, but woman for man. 
<bqverse 10>10  For this reason a woman should have a symbol of authority<a name="fnB144" href="1co_note.htm#fn144"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> on her head, because of the angels.<a name="fnB145" href="1co_note.htm#fn145"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11 In any case, in the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. 
<bqverse 12>12  For just as woman came from man, so man comes through woman. But all things come from God. 
<bqverse 13>13  Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 
<bqverse 14>14  Does not nature<a name="fnB146" href="1co_note.htm#fn146"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace for him, 
<bqverse 15>15  but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering.<a name="fnB147" href="1co_note.htm#fn147"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  If anyone intends to quarrel about this, we have no other practice, nor do the churches of God.<a name="_Toc403221838"></a><a name="_Toc416894326"></a><a name="_Toc432265189"></a><a name="_Toc485060130"></a><a name="_Toc494013627"></a></p>
<p><i>The Lord's Supper</i>
<p>
<bqverse 17>17 Now in giving the following instruction I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse. 
<bqverse 18>18  For in the first place, when you come together as a church I hear there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it. 
<bqverse 19>19  For there must in fact be divisions among you so that those of you who are approved may be evident.<a name="fnB148" href="1co_note.htm#fn148"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  Now when you come together at the same place, it is not in order to eat the Lord's Supper. 
<bqverse 21>21  For when it is time to eat, everyone takes his own supper. One is hungry and another becomes drunk. 
<bqverse 22>22  Do you not have houses so that you can eat and drink? Or are you trying to show contempt for the church of God by shaming those who have nothing? What should I say to you? Should I praise you? I will not praise you for this! <p>

<bqverse 23>23  For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread, 
<bqverse 24>24  and after he had given thanks he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me." 
<bqverse 25>25  In the same way, he also took the cup after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, every time you drink it, in remembrance of me." 
<bqverse 26>26  For every time you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.<p>

<bqverse 27>27 For this reason, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 
<bqverse 28>28  A person should examine himself, and in this spirit<a name="fnB149" href="1co_note.htm#fn149"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> let him eat the bread and drink of the cup.
<bqverse 29>29  For the one who eats and drinks without careful regard<a name="fnB150" href="1co_note.htm#fn150"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> for the body, eats and drinks judgment against himself. 
<bqverse 30>30  That is why many of you are weak and sick, and quite a few are dead.<a name="fnB151" href="1co_note.htm#fn151"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 31>31  But if we examined ourselves, we would not be judged. 
<bqverse 32>32  But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned with the world. 
<bqverse 33>33  So then, my brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB152" href="1co_note.htm#fn152"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> when you come together to eat, wait on one another. 
<bqverse 34>34  If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that when you assemble it does not lead to judgment. I will give directions about other matters when I come.

<p><i>Spiritual Gifts</i>
<p><A NAME="12"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> With regard to spiritual gifts,<a name="fnB153" href="1co_note.htm#fn153"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB154" href="1co_note.htm#fn154"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> I do not want you to be uninformed.<a name="fnB155" href="1co_note.htm#fn155"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  You know that when you were pagans you were often led astray by speechless idols, however you were led. 
<bqverse 3>3  So I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, "Jesus is cursed," and no one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit.<p>

<bqverse 4>4 Now there are different gifts, but the same Spirit. 
<bqverse 5>5  And there are different ministries, but the same Lord. 
<bqverse 6>6  And there are different results, but the same God who produces all of them in everyone. 
<bqverse 7>7  To each person the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the benefit of all. 
<bqverse 8>8  For one is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, and another the message of knowledge according to the same Spirit, 
<bqverse 9>9  to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, 
<bqverse 10>10  to another performance of miracles, to another prophecy, and to another discernment of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues. 
<bqverse 11>11  It is one and the same Spirit, distributing to each person as he<a name="fnB156" href="1co_note.htm#fn156"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> decides, who produces all these things.<a name="_Toc403221840"></a><a name="_Toc416894328"></a><a name="_Toc432265191"></a><a name="_Toc485060132"></a><a name="_Toc494013629"></a></p>
<p><i>Different Members in One Body</i>
<p>
<bqverse 12>12  For just as the body is one and yet has many members, and all the members of the body--though many--are one body, so too is Christ. 
<bqverse 13>13  For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body. Whether we are Jews or Greeks or slaves<a name="fnB157" href="1co_note.htm#fn157"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> or free we were all made to drink of the one Spirit. 
<bqverse 14>14  For in fact the body is not a single member, but many. 
<bqverse 15>15  If the foot says, "Since I am not a hand, I am not part of the body," it does not lose its membership in the body because of that. 
<bqverse 16>16  And if the ear says, "Since I am not an eye, I am not part of the body," it does not lose its membership in the body because of that. 
<bqverse 17>17  If the whole body were an eye, what part would do the hearing? If the whole were an ear, what part would do the smelling? 
<bqverse 18>18  But as a matter of fact, God has placed each of the members in the body just as he decided.
<bqverse 19>19  If they were all the same member, where would the body be? 
<bqverse 20>20  So now there are many members, but one body. 
<bqverse 21>21  The eye cannot say to the hand, "I do not need you," nor in turn can the head say to the foot, "I do not need you." 
<bqverse 22>22  On the contrary, those members that seem to be weaker are essential, 
<bqverse 23>23  and those members we consider less honorable we clothe with greater honor, and our unpresentable members are clothed with dignity,<a name="fnB158" href="1co_note.htm#fn158"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  but our presentable members do not need this. Instead, God has blended together the body, giving greater honor to the lesser member, 
<bqverse 25>25  so that there may be no division in the body, but the members may have mutual concern for one another. 
<bqverse 26>26  If one member suffers, everyone suffers with it. If a member is honored,<a name="fnB159" href="1co_note.htm#fn159"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> all rejoice with it. <p>

<bqverse 27>27  Now you are Christ's body, and each of you is a member of it. 
<bqverse 28>28  And God has placed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, gifts of healing, helps, gifts of leadership, different kinds of tongues. 
<bqverse 29>29  Not all are apostles, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? Not all are teachers, are they? Not all perform miracles, do they? 
<bqverse 30>30  Not all have gifts of healing, do they? Not all speak in tongues, do they? Not all interpret, do they?<a name="fnB160" href="1co_note.htm#fn160"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 31>31  But you should be eager for the greater gifts. <p>
And now I will show you a way beyond comparison.

<p><i>The Way of Love</i>
<p><A NAME="13"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but I do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 
<bqverse 2>2  And if I have prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so that I can remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
<bqverse 3>3  If I give away everything I own, and if I give over my body in order to boast,<a name="fnB161" href="1co_note.htm#fn161"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> but do not have love, I receive no benefit.<p>

<bqverse 4>4  Love is patient, love is kind, it is not envious. Love does not brag, it is not puffed up. 
<bqverse 5>5  It is not rude, it is not self-serving, it is not easily angered, or resentful. 
<bqverse 6>6  It is not glad about injustice, but rejoices in the truth. 
<bqverse 7>7  It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.<p>

<bqverse 8>8  Love never ends. But if there are prophecies, they will be set aside; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be set aside. 
<bqverse 9>9  For we know in part, and we prophesy in part, 
<bqverse 10>10  but when what is perfect<a name="fnB162" href="1co_note.htm#fn162"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> comes, the partial will be set aside. 
<bqverse 11>11  When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. But when I became an adult,<a name="fnB163" href="1co_note.htm#fn163"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> I set aside childish ways.
<bqverse 12>12  For now we see in a mirror indirectly,<a name="fnB164" href="1co_note.htm#fn164"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> but then we will see face to face. Now I know in part, then I will know fully, just as I have been fully known. 
<bqverse 13>13  And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.

<p><i>Prophecy and Tongues </i>
<p><A NAME="14"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Pursue love and be eager for the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy. 
<bqverse 2>2  For the one speaking in a tongue does not speak to people but to God, for no one understands; he is speaking mysteries by the Spirit.<a name="fnB165" href="1co_note.htm#fn165"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening,<a name="fnB166" href="1co_note.htm#fn166"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> encouragement and consolation. 
<bqverse 4>4  The one who speaks in a tongue builds himself up,<a name="fnB167" href="1co_note.htm#fn167"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> but the one who prophesies builds up the church. 
<bqverse 5>5  I wish you all spoke in tongues, but even more that you would prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets so that the church may be strengthened.<p>

<bqverse 6>6  Now, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB168" href="1co_note.htm#fn168"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I help you unless I speak to you with a revelation or with knowledge or prophecy or teaching? 
<bqverse 7>7  It is similar for lifeless things that make a sound, like a flute or harp. If they don't make a distinction in note, how will what is played on the flute or harp be understood? 
<bqverse 8>8  If, for example, the trumpet makes an unclear sound, who will get ready for battle? 
<bqverse 9>9  It is the same for you. If you don't speak clearly with your tongue, how will anyone know what is being said? For you will be speaking into the air. 
<bqverse 10>10  There are probably many kinds of languages in the world, and none is without meaning. 
<bqverse 11>11  If then I do not know the meaning of a language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me. 
<bqverse 12>12  It is the same with you. Since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit<a name="fnB169" href="1co_note.htm#fn169"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a>, seek to abound in order to strengthen the church.<p>

<bqverse 13>13  So then, one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret.
<bqverse 14>14  For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unproductive.
<bqverse 15>15 What should I do?<a name="fnB170" href="1co_note.htm#fn170"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing praises with my spirit, but I will also sing praises with my mind. 
<bqverse 16>16  Otherwise, if you are praising God with your spirit, how can someone without the gift<a name="fnB171" href="1co_note.htm#fn171"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> say "Amen" to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?
<bqverse 17>17  For you are certainly giving thanks well but the other person is not strengthened. 
<bqverse 18>18  I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you, 
<bqverse 19>19  but in the church I want to speak five words with my mind to instruct others, rather than ten thousand words in a tongue.<p>

<bqverse 20>20  Brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB172" href="1co_note.htm#fn172"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> do not be children in your thinking. Instead, be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature. 
<bqverse 21>21 It is written in the law: "<b><i>By people with strange tongues and by the lips of strangers</i></b><i> <b>I will speak to this people</b>,<b> yet not even in this way will they listen to me</b></i>,"<a name="fnB173" href="1co_note.htm#fn173"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> says the Lord. 
<bqverse 22>22  So then, tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers. Prophecy, however, is not for unbelievers but for believers. 
<bqverse 23>23  So if the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and unbelievers or uninformed people enter, won't they say that you are crazy? 
<bqverse 24>24  But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or uninformed person enters, he will be convicted by all, he will be called to account by all. 
<bqverse 25>25  The secrets of his heart are disclosed, and in this way he will fall on his face and worship God, declaring, "God is really among you."<a name="_Toc403221843"></a><a name="_Toc416894331"></a><a name="_Toc432265194"></a><a name="_Toc485060135"></a><a name="_Toc494013632"></a></p>
<p><i>Church Order</i>
<p>
<bqverse 26>26  What should you do then, brothers and sisters?<a name="fnB174" href="1co_note.htm#fn174"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> When you come together, each one has a song, has a lesson, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all these things be done for the strengthening of the church. 
<bqverse 27>27  If someone speaks in a tongue, it should be two, or at the most three, and one after the other. And someone must interpret. 
<bqverse 28>28  But if there is no interpreter, he should be silent in the church. Let him speak to himself and to God. 
<bqverse 29>29  Two or three prophets should speak and let others evaluate what is said. 
<bqverse 30>30  And if someone seated receives a revelation, the person speaking should conclude. 
<bqverse 31>31  For you can all prophesy one after another, so all can learn and be encouraged. 
<bqverse 32>32  Indeed, the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets, 
<bqverse 33>33 for God is not characterized by disorder but peace.<p>
As in all the churches of the saints,<a name="fnB175" href="1co_note.htm#fn175"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 34>34  the women<a name="fnB176" href="1co_note.htm#fn176"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> should be silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak.<a name="fnB177" href="1co_note.htm#fn177"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> Rather, let them be in submission, as in fact the law says. 
<bqverse 35>35  If they want to find out about something they should ask their husbands at home, because it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in church.<a name="fnB178" href="1co_note.htm#fn178"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 36>36  Did the word of God begin with you,<a name="fnB179" href="1co_note.htm#fn179"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> or did it come to you alone? <p>

<bqverse 37>37  If anyone considers himself a prophet or spiritual person, he should acknowledge that what I write to you is the Lord's command. 
<bqverse 38>38  If someone does not recognize this, he is not recognized. 
<bqverse 39>39  So then, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB180" href="1co_note.htm#fn180"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid anyone from speaking in tongues.<a name="fnB181" href="1co_note.htm#fn181"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 40>40  And do everything in a decent and orderly manner.

<p><i>Christ's Resurrection</i>
<p><A NAME="15"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Now I want to make clear for you,<a name="fnB182" href="1co_note.htm#fn182"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB183" href="1co_note.htm#fn183"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> the gospel that I preached to you, that you received and on which you stand, 
<bqverse 2>2 and by which you are being saved, if you hold firmly to the message I preached to you--unless you believed in vain. 
<bqverse 3>3  For I passed on to you as of first importance<a name="fnB184" href="1co_note.htm#fn184"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> what I also received--that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures, 
<bqverse 4>4  and that he was buried, and that he was raised<a name="fnB185" href="1co_note.htm#fn185"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> on the third day according to the scriptures, 
<bqverse 5>5  and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. 
<bqverse 6>6  Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters<a name="fnB186" href="1co_note.htm#fn186"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> at one time, most of whom are still living,<a name="fnB187" href="1co_note.htm#fn187"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> though some have fallen asleep.<a name="fnB188" href="1co_note.htm#fn188"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. 
<bqverse 8>8  Last of all, as though to one born at the wrong time,<a name="fnB189" href="1co_note.htm#fn189"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> he appeared to me also. 
<bqverse 9>9  For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. 
<bqverse 10>10  But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me has not been in vain. In fact, I worked harder than all of them--yet not I, but the grace of God with me. 
<bqverse 11>11  Whether then it was I or they, this is the way we preach and this is the way you believed.<a name="_Toc403221845"></a><a name="_Toc416894333"></a><a name="_Toc432265196"></a><a name="_Toc485060137"></a><a name="_Toc494013634"></a></p>
<p><i>No Resurrection?</i>
<p>
<bqverse 12>12  Now if Christ is being preached as raised from the dead,<a name="fnB190" href="1co_note.htm#fn190"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead? 
<bqverse 13>13  But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. 
<bqverse 14>14  And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is futile and your faith is empty. 
<bqverse 15>15  Also, we are found to be false witnesses about God, because we have testified against God that he raised Christ from the dead, when in reality he did not raise him, if indeed the dead are not raised. 
<bqverse 16>16  For if the dead are not raised, then not even Christ has been raised. 
<bqverse 17>17  And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is useless; you are still in your sins. 
<bqverse 18>18  Furthermore, those who have fallen asleep<a name="fnB191" href="1co_note.htm#fn191"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> in Christ have also perished. 
<bqverse 19>19  For if only in this life we have hope in Christ, we should be pitied more than anyone. <p>

<bqverse 20>20  But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. 
<bqverse 21>21  For since death came through a man,<a name="fnB192" href="1co_note.htm#fn192"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> the resurrection of the dead also came through a man.<a name="fnB193" href="1co_note.htm#fn193"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  For just as in Adam all die, so also all will be made alive in Christ. 
<bqverse 23>23  But each in his own order: Christ, the firstfruits; then when Christ comes, those who belong to him.<a name="fnB194" href="1co_note.htm#fn194"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  Then<a name="fnB195" href="1co_note.htm#fn195"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> comes the end,<a name="fnB196" href="1co_note.htm#fn196"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father, when he has brought to an end all rule and all authority and power. 
<bqverse 25>25  For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. 
<bqverse 26>26  The last enemy to be eliminated is death. 
<bqverse 27>27  For <b><i>he has put everything in subjection under his feet</i></b>.<a name="fnB197" href="1co_note.htm#fn197"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> But when it says "everything" has been put in subjection, it is clear that this does not include the one who put everything in subjection to him. 
<bqverse 28>28  And when all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will be subjected to the one who subjected everything to him, so that God may be all in all.<p>

<bqverse 29>29  Otherwise, what will those do who are baptized for the dead?<a name="fnB198" href="1co_note.htm#fn198"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> If the dead are not raised at all, then why are they baptized for them? 
<bqverse 30>30  Why too are we in danger every hour? 
<bqverse 31>31  Every day I am in danger of death! This is as sure as<a name="fnB199" href="1co_note.htm#fn199"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> my boasting in you, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB200" href="1co_note.htm#fn200"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord. 
<bqverse 32>32  If from a human point of view I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what did it benefit me? If the dead are not raised, <i>let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die</i>.<a name="fnB201" href="1co_note.htm#fn201"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 33>33  Do not be deceived: "Bad company corrupts good morals."<a name="fnB202" href="1co_note.htm#fn202"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 34>34  Sober up as you should, and stop sinning! For some have no knowledge of God--I say this to your shame!<a name="_Toc403221846"></a><a name="_Toc416894334"></a><a name="_Toc432265197"></a><a name="_Toc485060138"></a><a name="_Toc494013635"></a></p>
<p><i>The Resurrection Body</i>
<p>
<bqverse 35>35  But someone will say, "How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?" 
<bqverse 36>36  Fool! What you sow will not come to life unless it dies. 
<bqverse 37>37  And what you sow is not the body that is to be, but a bare seed<a name="fnB203" href="1co_note.htm#fn203"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a>--perhaps of wheat or something else. 
<bqverse 38>38 But God gives it a body just as he planned, and to each of the seeds a body of its own. 
<bqverse 39>39  All flesh is not the same: people have one flesh, animals have another, birds and fish another.<a name="fnB204" href="1co_note.htm#fn204"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 40>40  And there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. The glory of the heavenly body is one sort and the earthly another. 
<bqverse 41>41  There is a glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars, for star differs from star in glory.<p>

<bqverse 42>42  It is the same with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable.<a name="fnB205" href="1co_note.htm#fn205"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 43>43  It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; 
<bqverse 44>44  it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. 
<bqverse 45>45  So also it is written, "<b><i>The first man</i></b><i>,<b> Adam</b>,<b> became a living person</b></i>;<a name="fnB206" href="1co_note.htm#fn206"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> the last Adam became a life-giving spirit." 
<bqverse 46>46  However, the spiritual did not come first, but the natural, then the spiritual. 
<bqverse 47>47  The first man is from the earth, made of dust; the second man is from heaven. 
<bqverse 48>48  Like the one made of dust, so too are those made of dust, and like the one from heaven, so too those who are heavenly. 
<bqverse 49>49  And just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, let us also bear<a name="fnB207" href="1co_note.htm#fn207"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> the image of the man of heaven.<p>

<bqverse 50>50  Now this is what I am saying, brothers and sisters:<a name="fnB208" href="1co_note.htm#fn208"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. 
<bqverse 51>51  Listen,<a name="fnB209" href="1co_note.htm#fn209"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> I will tell you a mystery: we will not all sleep,<a name="fnB210" href="1co_note.htm#fn210"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> but we will all be changed-- 
<bqverse 52>52  in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. 
<bqverse 53>53  For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality.
<bqverse 54>54  Now when this perishable puts on the imperishable, and this mortal puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will happen,</p>
<br><b><i>"<b><i>Death has been swallowed up in victory</i></b><i>.</i>"<a name="fnB211" href="1co_note.htm#fn211"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a><br>
<bqverse 55>55 "<b><i>Where</i></b><i>,<b> O death</b>,<b> is your victory?</b></i><br>
<b><i>Where</i></b><i>,<b> O death</b>,<b> is your sting?</b></i>"<a name="fnB212" href="1co_note.htm#fn212"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a></i></b></ul><p>
<bqverse 56>56  The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. 
<bqverse 57>57  But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ! 
<bqverse 58>58  So then, dear brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB213" href="1co_note.htm#fn213"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> be firm. Do not be moved! Always be outstanding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

<p><i>A Collection to Aid Jewish Christians</i>
<p><A NAME="16"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> With regard to the collection for the saints, please follow the directions that I gave to the churches of Galatia:<a name="fnB214" href="1co_note.htm#fn214"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2 on the first day of the week, each of you should set aside some income<a name="fnB215" href="1co_note.htm#fn215"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> and save<a name="fnB216" href="1co_note.htm#fn216"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> it to the extent that God has blessed you,<a name="fnB217" href="1co_note.htm#fn217"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> so that a collection will not have to be made<a name="fnB218" href="1co_note.htm#fn218"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> when I come. 
<bqverse 3>3  Then, when I arrive, I will send those whom you approve with letters of explanation to carry your gift to Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 4>4  And if it seems advisable that I should go also, they will go with me.<a name="_Toc403221848"></a><a name="_Toc416894336"></a><a name="_Toc432265199"></a><a name="_Toc485060140"></a><a name="_Toc494013637"></a></p>
<p><i>Paul's Plans to Visit</i>
<p>
<bqverse 5>5  But I will come to you after I have gone through Macedonia--for I will be going through Macedonia--
<bqverse 6>6  and perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, so that you can send me on my journey, wherever I go. 
<bqverse 7>7  For I do not want to see you now in passing, since I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord allows. 
<bqverse 8>8 But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, 
<bqverse 9>9  because a door stands wide open for me, of great opportunity,<a name="fnB219" href="1co_note.htm#fn219"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> but there are many opponents.<p>

<bqverse 10>10  Now if Timothy comes, see that he has nothing to fear among you, for he is doing the Lord's work, as I am too. 
<bqverse 11>11  So then, let no one treat him with contempt. But send him on his way in peace so that he may come to me. For I am expecting him with the brothers.<a name="fnB220" href="1co_note.htm#fn220"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 12>12  With regard to our brother Apollos: I strongly encouraged him to visit you with the other brothers,<a name="fnB221" href="1co_note.htm#fn221"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> but it was simply not his intention to come now.<a name="fnB222" href="1co_note.htm#fn222"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> He will come when he has the opportunity.<a name="_Toc403221849"></a><a name="_Toc416894337"></a><a name="_Toc432265200"></a><a name="_Toc485060141"></a><a name="_Toc494013638"></a></p>
<p><i>Final Challenge and Blessing </i>

<bqverse 13>13  Stay alert, stand firm in the faith, show courage, be strong. 
<bqverse 14>14  Everything you do should be done in love. <p>

<bqverse 15>15  Now, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB223" href="1co_note.htm#fn223"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> you know about the household of Stephanus, that as the first converts<a name="fnB224" href="1co_note.htm#fn224"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> of Achaia, they devoted themselves to ministry for the saints. I urge you 
<bqverse 16>16  also to submit to people like this, and to everyone who cooperates in the work and labors hard. 
<bqverse 17>17  I was glad about the arrival of Stephanus, Fortunatus and Achaicus because they have supplied the fellowship with you that I lacked.<a name="fnB225" href="1co_note.htm#fn225"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  For they refreshed my spirit and yours. So then, recognize people like this.<p>
