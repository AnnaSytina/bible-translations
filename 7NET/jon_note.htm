 <b>tn </b> (1:1) <i>Heb</i> "The word of YHWH."  The genitive noun in the construction <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwhy rbd</FONT> ("word of the <b>LORD</b>") functions as a possessive genitive ("the <b>LORD</b>'s word") or more likely as a subjective genitive ("the <b>LORD</b> said") (see <i>IBHS</i> 9.5). The Aramaic Targum interprets the Hebrew as "There was a word of prophecy from the <b>LORD</b>" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ywy &lt;dq /m hawbn hwhw</FONT>) (cf. <i>Tg. Hos.</i> 1:1).<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="jon.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Heb</i> "The word of YHWH was to Jonah...saying...." The infinitive <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rmal</FONT> ("saying") introduces direct discourse and is untranslated in English.<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="jon.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)   <i>Heb</i> "Arise, go."  The two imperatives without an intervening <i>vav</i>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">El &lt;Wq</FONT> ("Arise, go!"), form a verbal hendiadys in which the first verb functions adverbially and the second retains its full verbal force: "Go immediately." This construction emphasizes the urgency of the command.  The translations "Go at once" (NRSV, NJPS) or simply "Go!" (NIV) are better than the traditional "Arise, go" (KJV, NKJV, ASV, NASV, RSV) or "Get up and go" (NLT).  For similar constructions with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;Wq</FONT> ("arise"), see Gen 19:14-15; Judg 4:14; 8:20-21; 1 Sam 9:3.<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="jon.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:2)  <i>Nineveh</i> was the last capital city of ancient Assyria. Occupying about 1800 acres, it was located on the east bank of the Tigris River across from the modern city of Mosul, Iraq. The site includes two tels, Nebi Yunus and Kouyunjik, which have been excavated on several occasions. See Austen Henry Layard, <i>Nineveh and Its Remains</i> (New York: Appleton, 1858); Reginald C. Thompson and R. W. Hutchinson, <i>A Century of Exploration at Nineveh</i> (London: Luzac, 1929); George Waterfield, <i>Layard of Nineveh</i> (New York: Praeger, 1963). Preliminary reports of limited excavations in 1987 and 1989 appear in <i>Mar [Sinvcircumflex]ipri</i> 1:2 (1988): 1-2; 2:2 (1989): 1-2; 4:1 (1991): 1-3. Also see Donald J. Wiseman's "Jonah's Nineveh," <i>TynBul</i> 30 (1979): 29-51.<br>
 <a name="fn4" href="jon.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  <i>Heb</i> "the." The article draws attention to a well-known fact and may function as a demonstrative pronoun: "that great city" (see <i>IBHS</i> 13.5.1.c).<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="jon.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  <i>Heb</i> "great city." The adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lwdg</FONT> ("great") can refer to a wide variety of qualities: (1) size: "large," (2) height: "tall," (3) magnitude: "great," (4) number: "populous," (5) power: "mighty," (6) influence: "powerful," (8) significance: "important," (7) finance: "wealthy," (8) intensity: "fierce," (9) sound: "loud," (10) age: "oldest," (11) importance: "distinguished," (12) position: "chief, leading, head" (<i>HALOT</i> 1:177-78; BDB 152-53). The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlwdg ryu</FONT> ("great city") may designate a city that is (1) large in size (Josh 10:2; Neh 4:7) or (2) great in power: (a) important city-state (Gen 10:12) or (b) prominent capital city (Jer 22:8). The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlwdg ryu</FONT> ("great city") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlwdgh ryuh</FONT> ("the great city") is used four times in Jonah (1:2; 3:2, 3; 4:11). This phrase is twice qualified by a statement about its immense dimensions (3:3) or large population (4:11), so <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lwdg</FONT> ("great") might denote size. However, size is not the issue in 1:2. At this time in history, Nineveh was the most powerful city in the ancient Near East as the capital of the mighty Neo-Assyrian Empire. It is likely that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lwdg ryu</FONT> ("great city") here is the Hebrew equivalent of the Assyrian <i>&acirc;lu rabu</i> ("the important city") = capital city of the empire, just as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">br yklm</FONT> ("great king") (Hos 5:13; 10:6) is the equivalent of the Assyrian <i>malku rabu</i> ("great king") = ruler of the empire (Douglas Stuart, <i>Hosea-Jonah</i>, WBC 31 [Waco: Word Books, 1987], 448). Perhaps the closest West Semitic parallel to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlwdgh ryuh</FONT> is in an Amarna letter from King Abimilki of Tyre to Amenhotep IV: "Behold, I protect Tyre, the capital city (<sup><i>uru</i></sup><i>Surri uru rabitu</i>) for the king my lord" (EA 147:61-63). Hebrew constructions in which a determined noun is modified by the determined adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lwdgh</FONT> ("the great...") often denote singular greatness (<i>numero uno</i>), e.g., <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lwdgh rhnh</FONT> ("the great river") = the Euphrates (Deut 1:7); <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lwdgh &lt;yh</FONT> ("the great sea") = the Mediterranean (Josh 1:4); <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lwdgh /hkh</FONT> ("the great priest") = the chief priest (Lev 21:10); <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ylwdgh &lt;yvnah</FONT> ("the great men") = the rulers (Jer 52:15); and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tazh hlwdgh ryul</FONT> ("[to] this great city") = this capital city (Jer 22:8). So <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lwdgh ryuh</FONT> ("the great city") may well connote "the capital city" here.<br>
 <a name="fn6" href="jon.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  <i>Heb</i> "Nineveh, the great city." The description "the great city" stands in apposition to "Nineveh." <br>
 <a name="fn7" href="jon.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)   <i>Heb</i> "cry out against it." The basic meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">arq</FONT> is "to call out; to cry out; to shout out" but here it is a technical term referring to what a prophet has to say: "to announce" (e.g., 1 Kgs 13:32; Isa 40:2, 6; Jer 3:12) (<i>HALOT</i> 3:1129.8). When used with the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu</FONT> ("against" [in a hostile sense]) (<i>HALOT</i> 2:826.5.a), it refers to an oracle announcing or threatening judgment (e.g., 1 Kgs 13:2, 4, 32) (BDB 895.3a). This nuance is reflected in several translations: "proclaim My judgment against it" (NLT) and "proclaim judgment upon it" (JPS, NJPS).  Others are less precise: "cry out against it" (KJV, NKJV, ASV, NASV, RSV, NRSV), "denounce it" (NEB, REB) or misleading: "preach against it" (NIV, NAB, NBV) and "preach in it" (DRA). The Aramaic Targum nuances this interpretively as "prophesy against" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlu ybgtaw</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="jon.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  <i>Heb</i> "it." The pronoun functions as a synecdoche of container for contents, referring to the people of Nineveh.<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="jon.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:2) <i> </i> The term <i>wickedness</i> is personified here; it is pictured ascending heavenward into the very presence of God.  This figuratively depicts how God became aware of their evil--it had ascended into heaven right into his presence.<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="jon.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  <i>Heb</i> "has come up before me."  The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ynpl</FONT> ("before me") often connotes "in the full cognitive knowledge of" or "in the full mental view" of someone (BDB 817.II.4.a.c) (e.g., Gen 6:13; Isa 65:6; Jer 2:22; Lam 1:22). The use of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlu</FONT> ("to ascend") complements this idea; it is sometimes used to describe actions or situations on earth that have "come up" into heaven to God's attention, so to speak (e.g., Exod 2:23; 1 Sam 5:12; 2 Kgs 19:28; Ps 74:23; Isa 37:29; Jer 14:2) (BDB 749.8).  The point is that God was fully aware of the evil of the Ninevites.<br>
 <a name="fn11" href="jon.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  <i>Heb</i> "he arose to flee." The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jrbl &lt;qyw</FONT> ("he arose to flee") is a wordplay on the <b>LORD</b>'s command <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">El &lt;wq</FONT>  "Arise! Go!" in v. 2. By repeating the first verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;wq</FONT> ("to arise"), the narrator sets up the reader to expect that Jonah was intending to obey God. But Jonah did not "arise to go" to Nineveh; he "arose to flee" to Tarshish. Jonah looks as though he was about to obey, but he does not do so. This unexpected turn of events creates strong irony. The narrator does not reveal Jonah's motivation to the reader at this point. He delays this revelation for rhetorical effect until 4:2-3.<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="jon.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  <i>Heb</i> "Tarshish." The place-name <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vyvrt</FONT>, "Tarshish," refers to a distant port city or region (Isa 23:6; Jer 10:9; Ezek 27:12; 38:13; 2 Chr 9:21; 20:36, 37) located on the coastlands in the Mediterranean west of Palestine (Ps 72:10; Isa 23:6, 10; 66:19; Jonah 1:3) (BDB 1076; <i>HALOT</i> 4:1798.E.a). Scholars have not established its actual location (<i>HALOT</i> 4:1797.B). It has been variously identified with Tartessos in southwest Spain (Herodotus, <i>Hist.</i> I:163; IV:152) (cf. Gen 10:4), Carthage (LXX of Isa 23:1, 14 and Ezek 27:25), and Sardinia (F. M. Cross, <i>BASOR</i> 208 [1972]: 14-16). The versions handle it variously. The LXX identifies <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vyvrt</FONT> with Carthage/<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Karchdwn</FONT> (Isa 23:1, 6, 10, 14; Ezek 27:12; 38:13). The place name <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vyvrt</FONT> is rendered "Africa" in the Aramaic Targum in some passages (1 Kgs 10:22; 22:49; Jer 10:9) and elsewhere as "sea" (Isa 2:16; 23:1, 14; 50:9; 66:19; Ezek 27:12, 25; 38:13; Jonah 4:2). The Jewish midrash <i>Canticles Rabbah</i> 5:14.2 cites Jonah 1:3 as support for the view that Tarshish = "the Great Sea" (the Mediterranean). It is possible that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vyvrt</FONT> does not refer to one specific port but is a general term for the distant Mediterranean coastlands in general (Ps 72:10; Isa 23:6, 10; 66:19). In some cases it seems to mean simply "the open sea": (1) the Aramaic Targum of Jonah 1:3 translates <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vyvrt</FONT> as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">amyb</FONT> "[he arose to flee] by to sea"; (2) Jerome's commentary on Isa 2:16 states that Hebrew scholars in his age defined <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vyvrt</FONT> as "sea"; and (3) the gem called <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vyvrt</FONT> II, "topaz" (BDB 1076; <i>HALOT</i> 4:1798), in  Exod 28:20 and 39:13 is rendered <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">amy &lt;wrk</FONT> ("the color of the sea") in <i>Tg. Onq.</i> (see Douglas Stuart, <i>Hosea-Jonah</i>, WBC [Waco: Word, 1987], 451). The designation <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vyvrt twyna</FONT> ("Tarshish-ships") referred to large sea-going vessels equipped for the high seas (1 Chr 9:21; Ps 48:8; Isa 2:16; 23:1, 14; 60:9; Ezek 27:25) or large merchant ships designed for international trade (1 Kgs 10:22; 22:49; 2 Chr 9:21; 20:36; Isa 23:10) (<i>HALOT</i> 4:1798.E.b). The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vyvrt</FONT> ("Tarshish") is derived from the Iberian <i>tart</i>[<i>uli</i>] with the Anatolian suffix <i>-issos/essos</i>, resulting in <i>Tartessos</i> (Galling, <i>BRL</i><sup>2</sup> 332a); however, the etymological meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vyvrt</FONT> is uncertain (see Albright, <i>BASOR</i> 83 [1941]: 21-22 with note 29) (<i>HALOT</i> 4:1797.A). The name <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vyvrt</FONT> ("Tarshish") appears in sources outside the Hebrew Bible in Neo-Assyrian <sup>KUR</sup><i>Tar-si-si</i> (Borger, <i>Inschriften</i> 86, &#167;57 line 10) and Greek <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Tarthsso"</FONT> (<i>HALOT</i> 4:1797.C).  Most translations render <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vyvrt</FONT> as "Tarshish" (KJV, NKJV, ASV, NASV, RSV, NRSV, NIV, NEB, NJB, JPS, NJPS), but CEV renders it more generally as "to Spain." One paraphrase emphasizes the rhetorical point: "in the opposite direction" (NLT).<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="jon.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3) <i> Heb</i> "Jonah arose to flee to Tarshish away from the <b>LORD</b>."<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="jon.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3) <i> Heb</i> "away from the presence of the <b>LORD</b>." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ynplm</FONT> ("away from the presence of") is composed of the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ynpl</FONT> ("in front of, before the presence of") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m</FONT> ("away from"). The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ynplm</FONT> is used with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jrb</FONT> ("to flee") only here in biblical Hebrew so it is difficult to determine its exact meaning (<i>HALOT</i> 3:942.4.h.iii) (see Ernst Jenni <i>Orientalia </i>47 [1978]: 357). The most likely options are: (1) Jonah simply fled from the <b>LORD</b>'s presence manifested in the temple (for mention of the temple elsewhere in Jonah, see 2:5,8). This is reflected in Jerome's rendering<i> fugeret in Tharsis a facie Domini</i> ("he fled to Tarshish away from the face/presence of the <b>LORD</b>"). The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ynplm</FONT> is used in this sense with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">axy</FONT> ("to go out") to depict someone or something physically leaving the manifested presence of the <b>LORD</b> (Lev 9:24; Num 17:11, 24; cf. Gen 4:16). This is reflected in several translations: "from the presence of the <b>LORD</b>" (KJV, NKJV, RSV, NRSV, ASV, NASV, NBV) and "out of the reach of the <b>LORD</b>" (REB). (2) Jonah was fleeing to a distant place outside the land of Israel (Douglas Stuart, <i>Hosea-Jonah</i>, WBC 31 [Waco: Word Books, 1987], 450). The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ynpl</FONT> ("before the presence of") is used in various constructions with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m</FONT> ("away from") to describe locations outside the land of Israel where YHWH was not worshipped (1 Sam 26:19-20; 2 Kgs 13:23; 17:20, 23; Jer 23:39). This would be the equivalent of a self-imposed exile. (3) The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ynplm</FONT> can mean "out of sight" (Gen 23:4,8), so perhaps Jonah was trying to escape from the <b>LORD</b>'s active awareness--out of the <b>LORD</b>'s sight. The idea would either be an anthropomorphism (standing for a distant out of the sight of God) or it would reflect an inadequate theology of the limited omniscience and presence of God. This is reflected in some translations: "ran away from the <b>LORD</b>" (NIV), "running away from Yahweh" (NJB), "to get away from the <b>LORD</b>" (NLT), "to escape from the <b>LORD</b>" (NEB) and "to escape" (CEV). (4) The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ynpl</FONT> can mean "in front of someone in power" (Gen 43:33) (<i>HALOT</i> 3:942.c.i) and "at the disposal of" a king (Gen 13:9; 24:51; 34:10; 2 Chr 14:6; Jer 40:4) (<i>HALOT</i> 3:942.4.f). The expression would be a metonymy: Jonah was trying to escape from his commission (effect) ordered by God (cause). This is reflected in several translations: "to flee from the <b>LORD</b>'s service" (JPS, NJPS). Jonah confesses in 4:2-3 that he fled to avoid carrying out his commission--lest God relent from judging Nineveh if its populace might repent. But it is also clear in chs. 1-2 that Jonah could not escape from the <b>LORD</b> himself.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:3)  Three times (in vv. 3 and 10) chap. 1 describes Jonah's boat ride as an attempt to escape <i>away from the </i><b>LORD</b>--from the <b>LORD</b>'s presence (and therefore his active awareness; compare v. 2). On one level, Jonah was attempting to avoid a disagreeable task, but the narrator's description personalizes Jonah's rejection of the task. Jonah's issue is with the <b>LORD</b> himself, not just his commission. The narrator's description is also highly ironic, as the rest of the book shows. Jonah tries to sail to Tarshish, in the opposite direction from Nineveh, as if by doing that he could escape from the <b>LORD</b>, when the <b>LORD</b> is the one who knows all about Nineveh's wickedness and is involved in all that happens to Jonah throughout the book. Compare Jonah's explanation when talking with the <b>LORD</b> (see 4:2).<br>
 <a name="fn15" href="jon.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3) <i> Heb</i> "he went down." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dry</FONT> ("to go down") can refer to a journey that is physically downhill. This suggests that Jonah had started out from Jerusalem, which is at a higher elevation. He probably received his commission in the temple (see 2:4, 7 for mention of the temple). <br>
 <b>sn </b> (1:3) The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dry</FONT> ("to go down") is repeated four times in chs. 1-2 for rhetorical effect (1:3a, 3b, 5; 2:7). Jonah's "downward" journey from Jerusalem <i>down</i> to Joppa (1:3a) <i>down</i> into the ship (1:3b) <i>down</i> into the cargo hold (1:5) and ultimately <i>down</i> into the bottom of the sea, pictured as down to the very gates of the netherworld (2:7), does not end until he turns back to God who brings him "up" from the brink of death (2:6-7).<br>
 <a name="fn16" href="jon.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:3)  <i>Joppa</i> was a small harbor town on the Palestinian coast known as Yepu in the Amarna Letters (14<sup>th</sup> century <b>B.C.</b>) and Yapu in Neo-Assyrian inscriptions (9<sup>th</sup>-8<sup>th</sup> centuries <b>B.C.</b>). It was a port through which imported goods could flow into the Levant (Josh 19:46; 2 Chr 2:15 [16]; Ezra 3:7).  It was never annexed by Israel until the Maccabean period (ca. 148 <b>B.C.</b>) (1 Macc 10:76). Jonah chose a port where the people he would meet and the ships he could take were not likely to be Israelite. Once in Joppa he was already partly "away from the <b>LORD</b>" as he conceived it.<br>

 <a name="fn19" href="jon.htm#fnB19"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3) <i> Heb</i> "its fare."  The 3fs suffix on the noun probably functions as a genitive of worth or value: "the fare due it."  However, it is translated here simply as "the fare" for the sake of readability.

 <a name="fn38" href="jon.htm#fnB38"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  Or "stern." There is some question whether the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkry</FONT> refers to the ship's hold below deck (<i>NIDOTTE</i> 23:282) or to the stern in the back of the ship (<i>HALOT</i> 2:439.2.b).<b>  </b>This is the only use of this term in reference to a ship in biblical Hebrew. When used elsewhere, this term has a two-fold range of meanings: (1) "rear," such as rear of a building (Exod 26:22, 27; 36:27, 32; Ezek 46:19), back room of a house (1 Kgs 6:16; Ps 128:3; Amos 6:10), flank of a person's body [figurative for rear border] (Gen 49:13); and (2) "far part" that is remote, such as the back of a cave (1 Sam 24:4), the bottom of a cistern (Isa 14:15), the lower recesses of Sheol (Ezek 32:23), the remotest part of a mountain range (Judg 19:1, 18; 2 Kgs 19:23; Isa 37:24), the highest summit of a mountain (Ps 48:3), and the north--viewed as the remotest part of the earth (Isa 14:13; Ezek 38:6, 15; 39:2). So the term could refer to the "back" (stern) or "remote part" (lower cargo hold) of the ship. The related Akkadian expression <i>arkat eleppi</i>, "stern of a ship" (<i>HALOT</i> 2:439.2.b) seems to suggest that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkry</FONT> means "stern" (<i>HALOT</i> 2:439.2.b). However, the preceding <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la ytkry</FONT> ("he went down into") suggests a point below deck. Also the genitive noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnyps</FONT> refers to a "ship" with a deck (BDB 706; <i>HALOT</i> 2:764; <i>NIDOTTE</i> 3:282).<br>
 <a name="fn39" href="jon.htm#fnB39"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  Or "of the ship." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnyps</FONT> refers to a "ship" with a deck (<i>HALOT</i> 2:764). The term is a <i>hapax legomenon</i> in Hebrew and is probably an Aramaic loanword. The term is used frequently in the related Semitic languages to refer to ships with multiple decks. Here the term probably functions as a synecdoche of whole for the part, referring to the "lower deck" rather than to the ship as a whole (<i>NIDOTTE</i> 3:282). An outdated approach related the noun to the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ps</FONT> ("to cover") and suggested that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnyps</FONT> describes a ship covered with sheathing (BDB 706). <br>
 <a name="fn40" href="jon.htm#fnB40"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  The a-class theme vowel of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;dryw</FONT> indicates that this is a stative verb, describing the resultant condition of falling asleep: "was sound asleep."<br>
 <a name="fn41" href="jon.htm#fnB41"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6) <i> Heb</i> "What to you sleeping!" The participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;drn</FONT>  (Niphal from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;dr</FONT>, "to sleep") functions here not as a vocative use of the noun (so KJV, NKJV, ASV: "O sleeper," RSV, NBV: "you sleeper") but as a verbal use to depict uninterrupted sleep up to this point. The expression <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;L-hm</FONT> ("what to you?") can express surprise (BDB 552.1.a) (e.g., Job 9:12; 22:12; Eccl 8:4; Isa 45:9,10) or indignation and contempt (BDB 552.1.c) (e.g., 1 Kgs 19:9, 13). Accordingly, the captain is either surprised that Jonah is able to sleep so soundly through the storm (NIV: "How can you sleep?"; JSP/NJPS: "How can you be sleeping so soundly?"; NEB/REB: "What, sound asleep?") or indignant that Jonah would sleep in a life-threatening situation when he should be praying (CEV: "How can you sleep at a time like this?"; NRSV/NAB: "What are you doing asleep/sound asleep?"; NBV: "What's the matter with you?";  NJB: "What do you mean by sleeping?").<br>
 <a name="fn42" href="jon.htm#fnB42"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6) <i> Heb</i> "cry out" or "call upon." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">arq</FONT> ("to call out, to cry out") + the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la</FONT> ("to") often depicts a loud audible cry of prayer to God for help in the midst of trouble: "to call on, to shout to" (<i>HALOT</i> 3:1129.9.b; BDB 895.2a) (e.g., Judg 15:18; 1 Sam 12:17, 18; 2 Sam 22:7; Hos 7:7; Pss 3:4 [5 HT]; 4:3 [4 HT]). Jonker notes: "The basic meaning of <i>qr'</i> is to draw attention to oneself by the audible use of one's voice in order to establish contact with someone else. The reaction of the called person is normally expressed by the verbs...`answer' and...`hear'" (<i>NIDOTTE</i> 3:971).<br>
 <b>sn </b> (1:6) The imperatives <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;wq</FONT> ("arise!") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">arq</FONT> ("cry out!") are repeated from v. 2 for ironic effect. The captain's words would have rung in Jonah's ears as a stinging reminder that the <b>LORD</b> had uttered them once before. Jonah was hearing them again because he had disobeyed them before.<br>
 <a name="fn43" href="jon.htm#fnB43"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  <i>Heb</i> "the god." The article on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yhlah</FONT> denotes previous reference to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;yhla</FONT>, "your god" (see <i>IBHS</i> 13.5.1.d). The captain refers here to the "god" just mentioned, that is, whatever god Jonah might pray to ("your god").<br>
 <a name="fn44" href="jon.htm#fnB44"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  Or "give thought to us." The verb is found only here in the OT. Related nouns are in Job 12:5 and Ps 146:5. The captain hopes for some favorable attention from a god who might act on behalf of his endangered crewmen.<br>
 <a name="fn45" href="jon.htm#fnB45"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  <i>Heb</i> "And they said, a man to his companion." The plural verb is individualized by "a man."<br>
 <a name="fn46" href="jon.htm#fnB46"><sup>47</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:7)  The English word <i>lots</i> is a generic term. In some cultures the procedure for "casting lots" is to "draw straws" so that the person who receives the short straw is chosen. In other situations a colored stone or a designated playing card might be picked at random. In Jonah's case, small stones were probably used.<br>
 <a name="fn47" href="jon.htm#fnB47"><sup>48</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:7)  In the ancient Near East, casting lots was a custom used to try to receive a revelation from the gods about a particular situation. The Phoenician sailors here cried out to their gods and cast lots in the hope that one of their gods might reveal the identity of the person with whom he was angry. The CEV has well captured the sentiment of v.7b: "`Let's ask our gods to show us who caused all this trouble.' It turned out to be Jonah."<br>
 <a name="fn48" href="jon.htm#fnB48"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  <i>Heb</i> "On whose account this calamity is upon us."<br>
 <a name="fn49" href="jon.htm#fnB49"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  <i>Heb</i> "the lot fell on Jonah." From their questions posed to Jonah, it does not appear that the sailors immediately realize that Jonah was the one responsible for the storm. Instead, they seem to think that he is the one chosen by their gods to reveal to them the one responsible for their plight. It is only after he admits that he was fleeing from the God whom he served in vv. 9-10 that they realize that Jonah was in fact the cause of their trouble.<br>
 <a name="fn50" href="jon.htm#fnB50"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:8)  <i>Heb</i> "On whose account is this calamity upon us?"<br>
 <a name="fn51" href="jon.htm#fnB51"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:8) <i> Heb</i> "And from what people are you?"<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:8)  <i>Whose fault...What's...Where...What's... </i>The questions delivered in rapid succession in this verse indicate the sailors' urgency to learn quickly the reason for the unusual storm.<br>
 <a name="fn52" href="jon.htm#fnB52"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  Or "fear." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ary</FONT> has a broad range of meanings, including "to fear, to worship, to revere, to respect" (BDB 431). When God is the object, it normally means "to fear" (leading to obedience) (BDB 431.1) or "to worship" (= to stand in awe of) (BDB 431.2). Because the fear of God leads to wisdom and obedience, that is probably not the sense here. Instead Jonah professes to be a loyal Yahwist--in contrast to the pagan Phoenician sailors who worshiped false gods, he worshiped the one true God. Unfortunately his worship of YHWH lacked the necessary moral prerequisite.<br>
 <a name="fn53" href="jon.htm#fnB53"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9) <i> Heb </i>"The <b>LORD</b>, the God of heaven, I fear." The Hebrew word order is unusual.  Normally the verb appears first, but here the direct object "the <b>LORD</b>, the God of heaven" precedes the verb. Jonah emphasizes the object of his worship. In contrast to the Phoenician sailors who worship pagan polytheistic gods, Jonah took pride in his theological orthodoxy. Ironically, his "fear" of YHWH in this case was limited to this profession of theological orthodoxy because his actions betrayed his refusal to truly "fear" God in the sense of obedience.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:9)  The word <i>fear</i> appears in v. 5, here in v. 9, and later in vv. 10 and 16. Except for this use in v. 9, every other use describes the sailors' response (emotional fear prompting physical actions) to the storm or to YHWH. By contrast, Jonah claims to fear God but his attitude and actions do not reflect this.  It is clear that Jonah does not "fear" in the same way that they do.<br>
 <a name="fn54" href="jon.htm#fnB54"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9) <i> Heb</i> "the God of the heavens." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ymv</FONT> ("heavens") always appears in the dual form. Although the dual form sometimes refers to things that exist in pairs, the dual is often used to refer to geographical locations, e.g., <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ylvwry</FONT> ("Jerusalem") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrpa</FONT> ("Ephraim"); and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrxm</FONT> ("Egypt") (but see <i>IBHS</i> 7.3.d). The dual form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ymv</FONT> does not refer to two different kinds of heavens or to two levels of heaven; it simply refers to "heaven" as a location--the dwelling place of God. Jonah's point is that he worships the High God of heaven--the one enthroned over all creation.<br>
 <a name="fn55" href="jon.htm#fnB55"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10) <i> Heb</i> "Then the men feared..." The <i>vav</i>-consecutive describes the consequence of Jonah's statement.

 <a name="fn56" href="jon.htm#fnB56"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  <i>Heb</i> "The men feared a great fear." The cognate accusative construction using the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ary</FONT> ("to fear") and the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hary</FONT> ("fear") from the same root (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ary</FONT>)  emphasizes the sailors' escalating fright: "they became very afraid" (see <i>IBHS</i> 10.2.1.g).<br>
 <a name="fn57" href="jon.htm#fnB57"><sup>58</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10) <i> Heb</i> "fleeing."<br>
 <a name="fn58" href="jon.htm#fnB58"><sup>59</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:10)  The first two times that Jonah is said to be running <i>away from the </i><b>LORD</b> (1:3), Hebrew word order puts this phrase last. Now in the third occurrence (1:10), it comes emphatically before the verb that describes Jonah's action. The sailors were even more afraid once they had heard who it was that Jonah had offended.<br>
 <a name="fn59" href="jon.htm#fnB59"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10) <i> Heb</i> "because he had told them." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dyGh</FONT> ("he had told") functions as a past perfect, referring to a previous event. <br>
 <a name="fn60" href="jon.htm#fnB60"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  <i>Heb</i> "the sea was walking and storming." The two participles <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rusw Elwh</FONT> ("walking and storming") form an idiom that means "the storm was growing worse and worse." When the participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Elwh</FONT> precedes another participle with <i>vav</i>, it often denotes the idea of "growing, increasing" (BDB 233.4.d) (e.g., Exod 19:19; 1 Sam 2:26; 2 Sam 3:1; 15:12; 2 Chr 17:12; Esth 9:4; Prov 4:18; Eccl 1:6). For example, "the power of David grew stronger and stronger (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qzjw Elwh</FONT>, "was walking and becoming strong"), while the dynasty of Saul grew weaker and weaker (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yLdw &lt;yklh</FONT>, "was walking and becoming weak" )" (2 Sam 3:1) (see <i>IBHS</i>, 37.6.d).<br>
 <a name="fn61" href="jon.htm#fnB61"><sup>62</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  The <i>vav</i>-consecutive prefixed to the imperfect/prefixed conjugation verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qTvyw</FONT> ("to quiet") denotes purpose/result (see <i>IBHS</i>,  38.3).<br>
 <a name="fn62" href="jon.htm#fnB62"><sup>63</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  <i>Heb</i> "become quiet for us."<br>

 <a name="fn64" href="jon.htm#fnB64"><sup>65</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:13)  The word translated <i>row</i> is used in Ezekiel to describe digging through a wall (Ezek 8:8; 12:5, 7, 12). Its use in Jonah pictures the sailors digging into the water as hard as they could.<br>
 <a name="fn65" href="jon.htm#fnB65"><sup>66</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:13)  The word for <i>land</i> here is associated with a Hebrew verb meaning "to be dry" and is the same noun used in v. 9 of dry ground in contrast with the sea, both made by the <b>LORD</b> (see also Gen 1:9-10;.Exod 4:9; 14:16, 22, 29; Jonah 2:10).<br>
 <a name="fn66" href="jon.htm#fnB66"><sup>67</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13) <i> Heb</i> "but they were not able." The phrase "to do it" does not appear in the Hebrew text but is supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.<br>
 <a name="fn67" href="jon.htm#fnB67"><sup>68</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13) <i> Heb</i> "the sea was walking and storming." See the note on the same idiom in v. 11.<br>

 <a name="fn69" href="jon.htm#fnB69"><sup>70</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:14)  Pss 115:3 and 135:6 likewise use these verbs (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jpj</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hcu</FONT>) in speaking of the <b>LORD</b> as characteristically doing what he wishes to do.<br>
 <a name="fn70" href="jon.htm#fnB70"><sup>71</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:16) <i> Heb</i> "they feared the <b>LORD</b> with a great fear." The root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ary</FONT> ("fear") is repeated in the verb and accusative noun, forming a cognate accusative construction which is used for emphasis (see <i>IBHS</i>, 10.2.1.g).  The idea is that they greatly feared the <b>LORD</b> or were terrified of him.<br>
 <a name="fn71" href="jon.htm#fnB71"><sup>72</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:16)  The editors of <i>BHS</i> suggest that the direct object <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwhy-ta</FONT> ("the <b>LORD</b>") might be a scribal addition, and that the original text simply read, "The men became greatly afraid..." However, there is no shred of external evidence to support this conjectural emendation. Admittedly, the apparent "conversion" of these Phoenician sailors to Yahwism is a surprising development. But two literary features support the Hebrew text as it stands. First, it is not altogether clear whether or not the sailors actually converted to faith in YHWH. They might have simply incorporated him into their polytheistic religion. Second, the narrator has taken pains to portray the pagan sailors as a literary foil to Jonah by contrasting Jonah's hypocritical profession to fear YHWH (v. 9) with the sailors' actions that reveal an authentic fear of God (v. 10, 14, 16).<br>
 <a name="fn72" href="jon.htm#fnB72"><sup>73</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:16) <i> Heb</i> "they vowed vows." The root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rdn</FONT> ("vow") is repeated in the verb and accusative noun, forming an emphatic effected accusative construction in which the verbal action produces the object specified by the accusative (see <i>IBHS</i>, 10.2.1.f). Their act of vowing produced the vows.  This construction is used to emphasize their earnestness and zeal in making vows to worship the God who had just spared their lives from certain death.<br>
 <a name="fn73" href="jon.htm#fnB73"><sup>74</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:16)  <i>Heb</i> "they sacrificed sacrifices." The root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jbz</FONT> ("sacrifice") is repeated in the verb and accusative noun, forming an emphatic effected accusative construction in which the verbal action produces the object (see <i>IBHS</i>, 10.2.1.f). Their act of sacrificing would produce the sacrifices.  It is likely that the two sets of effected accusative constructions here ("they vowed vows and sacrificed sacrifices") form a hendiadys; the two phrases connote one idea: "they earnestly vowed to sacrifice lavishly." It is unlikely that they offered animal sacrifices at this exact moment on the boat--they had already thrown their cargo overboard, presumably leaving no animals to sacrifice.  Instead, they probably vowed that they would sacrifice to the <b>LORD</b> when--and if--they reached dry ground. The Aramaic Targum also takes this as a vow to sacrifice but for a different reason. According to Jewish tradition, the heathen are not allowed to make sacrifice to the God of Israel outside Jerusalem, so the Targum modified the text by making it a promise to sacrifice: "they promised to offer a sacrifice before the <b>LORD </b>and they made vows" (see B. Levine, <i>The Aramaic Version of Jonah</i>, 70; K. Cathcart and R. Gordon, <i>The Targum of the Minor Prophets</i>, The Aramaic Bible, 14:106 n. 29).<br>

Baldwin notes, "Here, with YHWH as the subject, the verb stresses God's sovereign rule over events for the accomplishment of his purpose (as in 4:6-8, where the verb recurs in each verse). The `great fish' is in exactly the right place at the right time by God's command, in order to swallow Jonah and enclose him safely" ("Jonah," in <i>The Minor Prophets</i>, ed.

 <b>sn</b> (2:2)  The first verse of the prayer summarizes the whole--"I was in trouble; I called to the <b>LORD</b> for help; he rescued me; I will give him thanks"--before elaborating on the nature and extent of the trouble (vv. 3-7a), mentioning the cry for help and the subsequent rescue (6b-7), and promising to give thanks (8-9). These elements, as well as much vocabulary and imagery found in Jonah's prayer, appear also in other Hebrew psalms. With Jonah 2:1 compare, for example, Pss 18:6; 22:24; 81:7; 116:1-4; 120:1; 130:1-2; Lam 3:55-56. These references and others indicate that Jonah was familiar with prayers used in worship at the temple in Jerusalem; he knew "all the right words." Consider also Ps 107 with Jonah as a whole.<br>
 <a name="fn80" href="jon.htm#fnB80"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:2)  <i>Sheol</i> was a name for the place of residence of the dead, the underworld (see Job 7:9-10; Isa 38:17-18). Jonah pictures himself in the belly of Sheol, its very center--in other words he is as good as dead.<br>

The 2ms suffixes on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;ylgw ;yrbvm</FONT> ("your breakers and your waves") function as genitives of source. Just as God had hurled a violent wind upon the sea (1:4) and had sovereignly sent the large fish to swallow him (1:17 [2:1 HT]), Jonah viewed God as sovereignly responsible for afflicting him with sea waves that were crashing upon his head, threatening to drown him. The Aramaic Targum alters the 2ms suffixes to 3ms suffixes to make them refer to the sea and not to God, for the sake of smoothness: "all the gales of the sea and its billows."<br>

While many translations render this "I said" (KJV, NKJV, NAB, ASV, NASV, NIV, NLT), several nuance it "I thought" (JPS, NJPS, NEB, REB, NJB, TEV, CEV).<br>
 <a name="fn93" href="jon.htm#fnB93"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  Or "I have been expelled from your attention"; <i>Heb</i> "from in front of your eyes." See also Ps 31:22; Lam 3:54-56.<br>
 <a name="fn94" href="jon.htm#fnB94"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tc</b> (2:4)  Or "Yet I will look again to your holy temple" or "Surely I will look again to your holy temple."The MT and the vast majority of ancient textual witnesses vocalize consonantal <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ia</FONT> as the adverb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ea^</FONT> which functions as an emphatic asseverative "surely" (BDB 36.1) or an adversative "yet, nevertheless" (BDB 36.2) (so Aramaic Targum: "However, I shall look again upon your holy temple"). These options understand the line as an expression of hopeful piety. As a positive statement, Jonah expresses hope that he will live to return to worship in Jerusalem. It may be a way of saying, "I will pray for help, even though I have been banished" (see v. 8; cf. Dan 6:10). The sole dissenter is the Greek recension of Theodotion which reads the interrogative <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pw"</FONT> "how?" which reflects an alternate vocalization tradition of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ea@</FONT> --a defectively written form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Eya@</FONT> "how?" (BDB 32.1), that is, "How shall I again look at your holy temple?"  (cf. NRSV). Jonah laments that he will not be able to worship at the temple in Jerusalem again--this is a metonymical statement (effect for cause) that he feels certain that he is about to die. It continues the expression of Jonah's distress and separation from YHWH, begun in v. 2 and continued without relief in vv. 3-7a. The external evidence favors the MT; however, internal evidence seems to favor the alternate vocalization tradition reflected in Theodotion for four reasons. First, the form of the psalm is a declarative praise in which Jonah begins with a summary praise (v. 2), continues by recounting his past plight (vv. 3-6a) and YHWH's intervention (vv. 6b-7), and concludes with a lesson (v. 8) and vow to praise (v. 9). So the statement with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ia</FONT> in v. 4 falls within the plight--not within a declaration of confidence. Second, while the poetic parallelism of v. 4 could be antithetical ("I have been banished from your sight, <i>yet</i> I will again look to your holy temple"); however, synonymous parallelism fits the context of the lament better ("I have been banished from your sight; Will I ever again see your holy temple?"). Third, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ea@</FONT> is the more difficult vocalization because it is a defectively written form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Eya@</FONT> "how?" and therefore, easily confused with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ea^</FONT> "surely" or "yet, nevertheless." Fourth, nothing in the first half of the psalm reflects any inkling of confidence on the part of Jonah that he would be delivered from imminent death. In fact, Jonah states in v. 7 that he did not turn to God in prayer until some time later when he was on the very brink of death.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:4)  Both options for the start of the line ("how?" and "yet" or "surely") fit the ironic portrayal of Jonah in the prayer (see also vv.8-9). Jonah, who had been trying to escape the <b>LORD</b>'s attention, here appears as remarkably fond of worshiping him. Is there perhaps also a hint of motivation for the <b>LORD</b> to rescue this eager worshiper? Confession of disobedience, on the other hand, is absent. Compare Ps 31:22, where the first half (describing the plight) is very similar to the first half of Jonah 2:3, and the second half starts with "nevertheless" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/k@a*</FONT>) and is a positive contrast, a report that God heard, using four words that appear in Jonah 2:2 (cf. Job 32:7-8; Ps 82:6-7; Isa 49:4; Zeph 3:7).<br>
 <a name="fn95" href="jon.htm#fnB95"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4) <i> Heb</i> "Will I ever see your holy temple again?" The rhetorical question expresses denial: Jonah despaired of ever seeing the temple again.<br>

The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp#n\ </FONT>refers sometimes to the throat or neck (Pss 69:1[2]; 105:18; 124:4, 5; Isa 5:14) (<i>HALOT</i> 2:712.2). The water was up to Jonah's neck (and beyond), so that his life was in great danger (cf. Ps 69:1).<br>

The simple "ocean" is perhaps too prosaic, since this Hebrew word has primeval connections (Gen 1:2; 7:11; 8:2; Prov 8:27-28) and speaks of the sea at its vastest (Job 38:16-18; Ps 36:6; 104:5-9).<br>
 <a name="fn98" href="jon.htm#fnB98"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tc</b> (2:5)  The consonantal form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[ws</FONT> is vocalized by the MT as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[Ws</FONT> ("reed") but the LXX's <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">escath</FONT> ("end") reflects a vocalization of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[os</FONT> ("end"). The Aramaic Targum <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[wsd amy</FONT> interpreted <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[ws</FONT> as a reference to the Reed Sea (also known as the Red Sea). In fact, the Jewish midrashim in <i>Pirqe R. El.</i> 10 states that God showed Jonah the way by which the Israelites had passed through the Red Sea! The MT vocalization tradition is preferred.<br>
 <b>tn</b> (2:5)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[Ws</FONT> normally refers to "reeds"--freshwater plants that grow in Egyptian rivers and marshes (Exod 2:3,5; Isa 10:19); but here it refers to "seaweed" (<i>HALOT</i> 2:747.1).  Though the same freshwater plants do not grow in the Mediterranean, the name may be seen to fit similarly long plants growing in seawater.<br>

However, the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrh ybxq</FONT> does appear in the OT Apocrypha in Sir 16:19; therefore, it is not without precedent. Since Jonah emphasizes that he descended, as it were, to the very gates of the netherworld in the second half of this verse, it would be appropriate for Jonah to say that he went down "to the extremities [i.e., bottoms] of the mountains" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrh ybxql</FONT>). Therefore,the MT may be retained with confidence.<br>
 <b>tn</b> (2:6)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bxq</FONT> is used only three times in the Hebrew Bible, and this is the only usage in which it means "extremity; bottom" (BDB 891.2). The exact phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrh ybxq</FONT> "the extremities [bottoms] of the mountains" is used in the OT Apocrypha once in Sir 16:19.<br>
 <a name="fn101" href="jon.htm#fnB101"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6)  Some editions and translations (e.g., NEB, NRSV) have connected the "bottoms of the mountains" with the preceding--"weeds were wrapped around my head at the bottoms of the mountains"--and connect "I went down" with "the earth." Such a connection between "I went down" and "the earth" is difficult to accept. It would be more normal in Hebrew to express "I went down to the earth" with a directive ending (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hx*r+a^</FONT>) or with a Hebrew preposition before "earth" or without the definite article. The Masoretic accents, in addition, connect "ends of the mountains" with the verb "I went down" and call for a break between the verb and "earth."<br>
 <a name="fn102" href="jon.htm#fnB102"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6) <i> Heb </i>"As for the earth, its bars..." This phrase is a rhetorical nominative construction (also known as <i>casus pendens</i>) in which the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jrah</FONT> stands grammatically isolated and in an emphatic position prior to the 3fs suffix that picks up on it in <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hyjrb</FONT> ("its bars") (see <i>IBHS</i> 8.3). This construction is used to emphasize the subject, in this case, the "bars of the netherworld." The word translated "bars" appears elsewhere to speak of bars used in constructing the sides of the tabernacle and often of crossbars (made of wood or metal) associated with the gates of fortified cities (cf. Exod 36:31-34; Judg 16:3; 1 Kgs 4:13; Neh 3:3; Pss 107:16; 147:13; Isa 45:1-2).<br>
 <a name="fn103" href="jon.htm#fnB103"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6) <i> Heb</i> "the earth." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jra</FONT> usually refers to the "earth" but here refers to the "netherworld" (e.g., Job 10:21, 22; Ps 139:15; Isa 26:19; 44:23) (BDB 76.2.g). This is parallel to the related Akkadian term <i>irsitu</i> used in the phrase "the land of no return," that is, the netherworld.  This refers to the place of the dead (along with "belly of Sheol," v. 2, and "the grave," v. 6) for the place of the dead, which is sometimes described as having "gates" (Job 38:17; Ps 107:18).<br>
 <a name="fn104" href="jon.htm#fnB104"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6)  <i>Heb</i> "behind me." The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">du^B^</FONT> with a pronominal suffix and with the meaning "behind" is found also in Judg 3:23. Jonah pictures himself as closed in and so unable to escape death.  Having described how far he had come (totally under water and "to the ends of mountains"), Jonah describes the way back as permanently closed against him. Just as it was impossible for a lone individual to walk through the barred gates of a walled city, so Jonah expected it was impossible for him to escape death.<br>
 <a name="fn105" href="jon.htm#fnB105"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6) <i> Heb</i> "As for the earth, its bars [were] against me forever." This line is a verbless clause.

 <a name="fn106" href="jon.htm#fnB106"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6) <i> Heb</i> "my life." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yyj</FONT> ("my life") functions metonymically as a 1cs pronoun "me."<br>

He is speaking rhetorically, for he had not actually died. His point is that he was as good as dead if God did not intervene immediately. See Pss 7:15; 30:3; 103:4; Ezek 19:3-4, 8.<br>
 <a name="fn108" href="jon.htm#fnB108"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:7) <i> Heb</i> "my soul." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vpn</FONT> ("soul") is often used as a metonymy for the life and the animating vitality in the body: "my life" (BDB 659.3.c).<br>

The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[futh</FONT> ("to faint away") is used elsewhere to describe (1) the onset of death when a person's life begins to slip away (Lam 2:12), (2) the loss of one's senses due to turmoil (Ps 107:5), and (3) the loss of all hope of surviving calamity (Pss 77:4; 142:4; 143:4) (BDB 742). All three options are reflected in the translations:  "when my life was ebbing away" (JPS, NJPS), "when my life was slipping away" (CEV), "when I felt my life slipping away" (TEV), "as my senses failed me" (NEB), and "when I had lost all hope" (NLT).<br>
 <a name="fn110" href="jon.htm#fnB110"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:7)  <i>Heb</i> "remembered." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rkz</FONT>  usually means "to remember, to call to mind" but it can also mean "to call out" (e.g., Nah 2:6) as in the related Akkadian verb <i>zikaru</i>, "to name, to mention."  The idiom "to remember the <b>LORD</b>" here encompasses calling to mind his character and past actions and appealing to him for help (Deut 8:18-19; Ps 42:6-8; Isa 64:4-5; Zech 10:9). The Aramaic Targum glosses the verb as "I remembered the worship of the <b>LORD,</b>" which somewhat misses the point.<br>

The verbal root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rmv</FONT> ("to keep, to watch") appears in the Piel stem only here in biblical Hebrew, meaning "to pay regard to" (BDB 1037).

 <a name="fn113" href="jon.htm#fnB113"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:8)  <i>Heb</i> "worthlessnesses of nothingness" or "vanities of emptiness." The genitive construct <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">awv-ylbh</FONT> forms an attributive adjective expression: "empty worthlessness" or "worthless vanities." This ironic reference to false gods is doubly insulting (e.g., Ps 31:7).  The  noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lb#h#</FONT> ("vapor, breath") is often used figuratively to describe what is insubstantial, empty, and futile (31 times in Eccl) (e.g., Pss 39:4-6, 11; 144:4; Prov 13:11; 21:6; Isa 30:7; 49:4). It often refers to idols--the epitome of emptiness, nothingness and worthlessness (Deut 32:21; 1 Kgs 16:13, 26; Ps 31:7; Jer 8:19; 10:8, 15; 14:22; 16:19; 51:18). The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aw+v*</FONT> ("worthlessness, emptiness, nothingness") describes what is ineffective and lacking reality (BDB 996) (e.g., Exod 20:7; Pss 60:11; 127:1; Ezek 22:28). It is also often used to refer to idols (e.g., Ps 31:7; Jer 18:15; Hos 5:11).<br>
 <a name="fn114" href="jon.htm#fnB114"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:8)  <i>Heb</i> "abandon their mercy/loyalty." The meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;dsj</FONT>, "forsake their mercy/loyalty," is greatly debated. There are two exegetical issues that are mutually related. First, does the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dsj</FONT> here mean (1) "mercy, kindness" that man receives from God, or (2) "loyalty, faithfulness" that man must give to God (see BDB 338-39l ; <i>HALOT</i> 1:336-37).  Second, the 3mpl suffix on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;dsj</FONT> "their loyalty/mercy" has been taken as (1) subjective genitive, referring to the loyal allegiance they ought to display to the true God: "they abandon the loyalty they should show." Examples of subjective genitives are: "This is <i>your kindness</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Edsj</FONT>) which you must do for me: every place to which we come, say of me, `He is my brother'" (Gen 20:13) (also cf. Gen 40:14; 1 Sam 20:14-15). Several translations take this approach: "forsake their faithfulness" (NASV), "abandon their faithful love" (NJB), "abandon their loyalty" (NEB, REB), "forsake their true loyalty" (RSV, NRSV), "turn their backs on all God's mercies" (NLT), "have abandoned their loyalty to You" (TEV). (2) This has also been taken as objective genitive, referring to the mercy they might have received from God: "they forfeit the mercy that could be theirs." The versions interpret <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;dsj</FONT> ("their mercy") in this sense: "they do not know the source of their welfare" (Targum), "forsake the source of their welfare" (Vulgate), and "abandon their own mercy" (LXX). Several translations follow this approach: "forsake their source of mercy" (NAB); "forfeit the grace that could be theirs" (NIV), "give up the grace that could be theirs" (NBV), "forsake their own welfare" (JPS, NJPS), "forsake their own mercy" (KJV, ASV), "forsake their own Mercy" (NKJV), "turn from the God who offers them mercy" (CEV). This is a difficult lexical/syntactical problem. On the one hand, the next line contrasts their failure with Jonah's boast of loyalty to the true God--demonstrating that he, unlike pagan idolators, deserves to be delivered. On the other hand, the only other use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dsj</FONT> in the book refers to "mercy" God bestows (4:2)--something that Jonah did not believe that the (repentant) pagan idolators had a right to receive. BDB 339.II takes this approach--"He is their <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;dsj</FONT> goodness, favour Jonah 2:9"--and cites other examples of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dsj</FONT> with suffixes referring to God: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ydsj</FONT> "my kindness" = he shows kindness to me (Ps 144:2); and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ydsj yhla </FONT>"the God of my kindness" = the God who shows kindness to me (Ps 59:18).<br>

Some <b>MSS</b> of the Aramaic Targum read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hdwa tjbvwt lqb</FONT> "with the sound of hymns of thanksgiving"--the longer reading probably reflects an editorial gloss, explaining <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hdwt</FONT> ("thanksgiving") as "hymns of thanksgiving."<br>
 <b>tn</b> (2:9)  <i>Heb</i> "voice/sound of thanksgiving." The genitive <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hdwt</FONT> ("thanksgiving") specifies the kind of public statement that will accompany the sacrifice. The construct noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lwq</FONT> ("voice, sound") functions as a metonymy of cause for effect, referring to the content of what the voice/sound produces: hymns of praise or declarative praise testimony.<br>

 <a name="fn124" href="jon.htm#fnB124"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:2)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">arq</FONT> ("proclaim") is repeated from 1:2 but with a significant variation. The phrase in 1:2 was the adversative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu arq</FONT> ("to proclaim against"), which often designates an announcement of threatened judgment (1 Kgs 13:4, 32; Jer 49:29; Lam 1:15). However, here the phrase is the more positive <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la arq</FONT> ("to proclaim to") which often designates an oracle of deliverance or a call to repentance, with accompanying offer of deliverance that is either explicit or implied (Deut 20:10; Isa 40:2; Zech 1:4) (<i>HALOT</i> 3:1129.8; BDB 895.3.a). This shift from the adversative preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu</FONT> ("against") to the more positive preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la</FONT> ("to") might signal a shift in God's intentions or perhaps it simply makes his original intention more clear. While God threatened to judge Nineveh, he was very willing to relent and forgive when the people repented from their sins (3:8-10). Jonah later complains that he knew that God was likely to relent from the threatened judgment all along (4:2).<br>
 <a name="fn125" href="jon.htm#fnB125"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:3)  <i>Heb</i> "was a great city to God/gods." The greatness of Nineveh has been mentioned already in 1:2 and 3:2. What is being added now? Does the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yh!Oal@</FONT> ("to God/gods") (1) refer to the <b>LORD</b>'s personal estimate of the city, (2) does it speak of the city as "belonging to" God, (3) does it refer to Nineveh as a city with many shrines and gods, or (4) is it simply an idiomatic reinforcement of the city's size? Interpreters do not agree on the answer. To introduce the ideas of God's ownership or of dedication to idolatry (though not impossible) is unexpected here, being without parallel or follow-up elsewhere in the book. The alternatives "great/large/important in God's estimation" (consider Ps 89:41b) or the merely idiomatic "exceptionally great/large/important" could either one be amplified by focus on physical size in the following phrase and are both consistent with emphases elsewhere in the book (Jonah 4:11 again puts attention on size--of population). If "great" is best understood as a reference primarily to size here, in view of the following phrase and v. 4a (Jonah went "one day's walk"), rather than to importance, this might weigh slightly in favor of an idiomatic "very great/large," though no example with "God" used idiomatically to indicate superlative (Gen 23:6; 30:8; Exod 9:28; 1 Sam 14:15; Pss 36:6; 80:10) has exactly the same construction as the wording in Jonah 3:3.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (3:3)  <i>Requiring a three-day walk</i>. Although this phrase is one of the several indications in the book of Jonah of Nineveh's impressive size, interpreters are not precisely sure what "a three-day walk" means. In light of the existing archaeological remains, the phrase does not describe the length of time it would have taken a person to walk around the walls of the city or to walk from one end of the walled city to the other. Other suggestions are that it may indicate the time required to walk from one edge of Nineveh's environs to the other (in other words, including outlying regions) or that it indicates the time required to arrive, do business, and leave. More information might also show that the phrase involved an idiomatic description (consider Gen 30:36; Exod 3:18; a three-day-journey would be different for families than for soldiers, for example), rather than a precise measurement of distance, for which terms were available (Ezek 45:1-6; 48:8-35). With twenty miles as quite a full day's walk, it seems possible and simplest, however, to take the phrase as including an outlying region associated with Nineveh, about sixty miles in length.<br>

The Niphal <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tkphn</FONT> ("be overturned") refers to a city being overthrown and destroyed (BDB 246.2.d). The related Qal form refers to the destruction of a city by military conquest (Judg 7:3; 2 Sam 10:3; 2 Kgs 21:13; Amos 4:11) or divine intervention as in the case of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen 19:21, 25, 29; Deut 29:22; Jer 20:16; Lam 4:6) (BDB 245.1.b). The participle form used here depicts an imminent future action (see <i>IBHS</i>  37.6.f) which is specified as only "forty days" away.<br>

Then vv. 6-9 provide specific details, focusing on the king's reaction. The Ninevites' response parallels the response of the pagan sailors in 1:6 and 13-16. <br>

In Jonah where the quotation does not begin immediately after "said" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rma</FONT>), it is only the speaker or addressee or both that come between "said" and the start of the quotation (1:6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12; 4:4, 9, 10; cf. 1:1; 3:1).<br>

By speaking of the harm they did as "in their hands," the king recognized the Ninevites' personal awareness and immediate responsibility. The term "hands" is either a synecdoche of instrument (e.g., "Is not the hand of Joab in all this?" 2 Sam 14:19) or a synecdoche or part for the whole. His descriptive figure reinforces their guilt.<br>
 <a name="fn139" href="jon.htm#fnB139"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:9)  The king expresses his uncertainty whether Jonah's message constituted a conditional announcement or an unconditional decree. Jeremiah 18 emphasizes that God sometimes gives people an opportunity to repent when they hear an announcement of judgment. However, as Amos and Isaiah learned, if a people refused to repent over a period of time, the patience of God could be exhausted. The offer of repentance in a conditional announcement of judgment can be withdrawn and in its place an unconditional decree of judgment issued. In many cases it is difficult to determine on the front end whether or not a prophetic message of coming judgment is conditional or unconditional, thus explaining the king's uncertainty.<br>
 <a name="fn140" href="jon.htm#fnB140"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:9)  "he might turn and relent." The two verbs <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;jnw bwvy</FONT> may function independently ("turn and repent") or form a verbal hendiadys ("be willing to turn") (see <i>IBHS</i> 32.3.b). The imperfect <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwvy</FONT> ("turn") and the perfect with prefixed <i>vav</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;jnw</FONT>) form a future-time narrative sequence. Both verbs function in a modal sense, denoting possibility, as the introductory interrogative suggests ("Who knows...?"). When used in reference to past actions, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwv</FONT> can mean "to be sorry" or "to regret" that someone did something in the past, and used in reference to future planned actions, it can mean "to change one's mind" about doing something or "to relent" from sending judgment (BDB 997.6). The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;jn</FONT> can mean "to be sorry" about past actions (e.g., Gen 6:6, 7; 1 Sam 15:11, 35) and "to change one's mind" about future actions (BDB 637.2). These two verbs are used together elsewhere in passages that consider the question of whether or not God will change his mind and relent from judgment he has threatened (e.g., Jer 4:28). The verbal root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bwv</FONT> ("turn") is used four times in vv. 8-10, twice of the Ninevites "repenting" from their moral evil and twice of God "relenting" from his threatened calamity. This repetition creates a wordplay that emphasizes the appropriateness of God's response: if the people repent, God might relent.<br>

The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hur</FONT> ("calamity, disaster") functions as a metonymy of result--the cause being the threatened judgment (e.g., Exod 32:12, 14; 2 Sam 24:16; Jer 18:8; 26:13, 19; 42:10; Joel 2:13; Jonah 4:2) (<i>HALOT</i> 3:1263.6). The root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hur</FONT> is repeated three times in vv. 8 and 10. Twice it refers to the Ninevites' moral "evil" (vv. 8 and 10a) and here it refers to the "calamity" or  "disaster" that YHWH had threatened (v. 10b). This repetition of the root forms a polysemantic wordplay that exploits this broad range of meanings of the noun. The wordplay emphasizes that God's response was appropriate: because the Ninevites repented from their moral "evil" God relented from the "calamity" he had threatened.<br>

The use of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">uur</FONT> ("to be evil, bad") and the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hur</FONT> ("evil, bad, calamity") here in 4:1 creates a wordplay with the use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hur</FONT> in 3:8-10. When God saw that the Ninevites repented from their moral evil (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hur</FONT>), he relented from the calamity (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hur</FONT>) that he had threatened--this development was greatly displeased (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hur</FONT>) Jonah.<br>
 <a name="fn149" href="jon.htm#fnB149"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:1)  <i>Heb</i> "it burned to him." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrj</FONT> ("to burn") functions figuratively here (hypocatastasis) referring to anger (BDB 354). It is related to the noun "heat/burning" <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/orh&amp;</FONT> in  "the heat of his anger" in 3:9. The repetition of the root highlights the contrast in attitudes between Jonah and God: God's burning anger "cooled off" when the Ninevites repented; but Jonah's anger was "kindled" when God did not destroy Nineveh.<br>
 <a name="fn150" href="jon.htm#fnB150"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:2) <i> Heb</i> "my saying?" The 1cs suffix on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yrma</FONT> ("my saying") functions as a subjective genitive: "I said." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rma</FONT> ("to say") here refers to the inner speech and thoughts of Jonah (see <i>HALOT</i> 1:66.4; BDB 56.2) (e.g., Gen 17:17; Ruth 4:4; 1 Sam 20:26; Esth 6:6; Jonah 2:4). There is no hint anywhere else in the book that Jonah had argued with God when he was originally commissioned. While most translations render it "I said" or "my saying," a few take it as inner speech: "This is what I feared" (NEB), "It is just as I feared" (REB), "I knew from the very beginning" (CEV).<br>
 <a name="fn151" href="jon.htm#fnB151"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:2)  The phrase "would happen" does not appear in the Hebrew text but is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity and smoothness.<br>

 <a name="fn153" href="jon.htm#fnB153"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:2)  Or "This is why I originally fled to Tarshish." The Piel<i> </i>verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;dq</FONT> has a broad range of meanings and here could mean: (1) "to go before, be in front of" (1 Sam 20:25; Ps 68:26); (2) "to do [something] beforehand," (Ps 119:147); or (3) "to anticipate, to do [something] early, forestall [something]" (Ps 119:148). The lexicons nuance Jonah 4:2 as "to do [something] for the first time" (<i>HALOT</i> 3:1069.4) or "to do [something] beforehand" (BDB 870.3). The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jrbl ytmdq</FONT> ("I did the first time to flee") is an idiom that probably means "I originally fled" or "I fled the first time." The infinitive construct <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jrbl</FONT> ("to flee") functions as an object complement. This phrase is translated variously, depending on the category of meaning chosen for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;dq</FONT> (see above): (1) "to do [something] for the first time, beforehand": "That is why I fled beforehand" (JPS, NJPS), "I fled before" (KJV), "I fled previously" (NKJV), "I fled at the beginning" (NRSV), "I first tried to flee" (NJB), "I fled at first" (NAB); (2) "to do [something] early, to hasten to do [something]": "That is why I was so quick to flee" (NIV), "I hastened to flee" (ASV), "I made haste to flee" (RSV), "I did my best to run away" (TEV); and (3) "to anticipate, forestall [something]": "it was to forestall this that I tried to escape to Tarshish" (REB), "to forestall it I tried to escape to Tarshish" (NEB), "in order to forestall this I fled" (NASV); "I fled to Tarshish to prevent it" (NBV). The versions handle it variously: (1) "to do [something] early, to hasten to do [something]": "Therefore I made haste to flee" (LXX), "That is why I hastened to run away" (Targum); and (2) "to go before, to be in front": "Therefore I went before to flee to Tarshish" (Vulgate). The two most likely options are (1) "to do [something] the first time" = "This is why I originally fled to Tarshish" and (2) "to anticipate, forestall [something]" = "This is what I tried to forestall [= prevent] by fleeing to Tarshish."<br>
 <a name="fn154" href="jon.htm#fnB154"><sup>7</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:2)  The narrator skillfully withheld Jonah's motivations from the audience up to this point for rhetorical effect--to build suspense and to create a shocking, surprising effect. Now, for the first time, the narrator reveals why Jonah fled from the commission of God in 1:3--he had not wanted to give God the opportunity to relent from judging Nineveh! Jonah knew that if he preached in Nineveh, the people might repent and as a result, God might more than likely relent from sending judgment. Hoping to seal their fate, Jonah had originally refused to preach so that the Ninevites would not have an opportunity to repent. Apparently Jonah hoped that God would have therefore judged them without advance warning. Or perhaps he was afraid he would betray his nationalistic self-interests by functioning as the instrument through which the <b>LORD</b> would spare Israel's main enemy. Jonah probably wanted God to destroy Nineveh for three reasons: (1) as a loyal nationalist, he despised non-Israelites (cf. 1:9); (2) he believed that idolators had forfeited any opportunity to be shown mercy (cf. 2:9-10); and (3) the prophets Amos and Hosea had recently announced that God would sovereignly use the Assyrians to judge unrepentant Israel (Hos 9:3; 11:5) and take them into exile (Amos 5:27). If God destroyed Nineveh, the Assyrians would not be able to destroy Israel. The better solution would have been for Jonah to work for the repentance of Nineveh <i>and</i> Israel.<br>

 <a name="fn156" href="jon.htm#fnB156"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:2)  <i>Heb</i> "long of nostrils." Because the nose often expresses anger through flared nostrils it became the source of this idiom meaning "slow to anger" (e.g., Exod 34:6; Num 14:18; Neh 9:17; Pss 86:15; 103:8; 145:8; Jer 15:15; Nah 1:3) (BDB 74).<br>

The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hur</FONT> ("calamity, disaster") functions as a metonymy of result--the cause being the threatened judgment (e.g., Exod 32:12, 14; 2 Sam 24:16; Jer 18:8; 26:13, 19; 42:10; Joel 2:13; Jonah 4:2). The classic statement of God's willingness to relent from judgment when a sinful people repent is Jer 18:1-11.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (4:2)  Jonah is precisely correct in his listing of the <b>LORD</b>'s attributes. See Exod 34:6-7; Num 14:18-19; 2 Chr 30:9; Neh 9:17, 31-32; Pss 86:3-8, 15; 103:2-13; 116:5 (note the parallels to Jonah 2 in Ps 116:1-4); 145:8; Neh 9:17; Joel 2:13.<br>

"Does it so thoroughly burn to you?" or "Does it rightly burn to you?" or "Does it burn so thoroughly to you?" The Hiphil of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bfy</FONT> ("to do good") here may mean: (1) "to do [something] rightly" in terms of ethical right and wrong (BDB 406.5.b; <i>HALOT</i> 2:408.3.c) (e.g., Gen 4:7; Lev 5:4; Pss 36:4; 119:68; Isa 1:17; Jer 4:22; 13:23). This approach is adopted by many translations: "Do you have any right to be angry?" (NIV); "Are you right to be angry?" (REB, NJB); "Is it right for you to be angry?" (NRSV, NLT); "Do you have good reason to be angry?" (NASV, NAB, NBV); "Do you do well to be angry?" (KJV, NKJV, ASV, RSV); "What right do you have to be angry?" (TEV, CEV). (2) The Hiphil of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bfy</FONT> ("to do good") here may be used as an adverb meaning "well, utterly, thoroughly" (BDB 405.3; <i>HALOT</i> 2:408.5) (e.g., Deut 9:21; 13:15; 17:4; 19:18; 27:8; 1 Sam 16:17; 2 Kgs 11:18; Prov 15:2; Isa 23:16; Jer 1:12; Ezek 33:32; Mic 7:3). This view is adopted by other translations: "Are you that deeply grieved?" (JPS, NJPS); "Are you so angry?" (NEB). This is also the approach of the Aramaic Targum: "Are you that greatly angered?" Whether or not Jonah had the right to be angry about the death of the plant is a trivial issue. Instead the dialogue focuses on the depth of Jonah's anger: he would rather be dead than alive (vv. 3, 8) and he concludes by saying that he was angry as he could possibly be (v. 9) (see note on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twm-du</FONT> "to death" in v. 9). YHWH then uses an <i>a fortiori</i> argument (from lesser to greater): Jonah was very upset that the plant had died (v. 10), likewise God was very concerned about averting the destruction of Nineveh (v. 11).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (4:4)  The use of the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bfy</FONT> ("rightly, good") creates a wordplay with its antonym <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hur</FONT> ("evil, wrong") which is used in 4:1 of Jonah's bad attitude.<br>

 <a name="fn163" href="jon.htm#fnB163"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:5)  <i>Heb</i> "from the east" or "from the front." When used to designate a location, the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;dq</FONT> may mean "front" (BDB 869.1.a) or "east" (BDB 869.1.b). The construction <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;dq</FONT> + preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m</FONT> "front" means "from the front" = "in front of" (Job 23:8; Ps 139:5; Isa 9:11) or "from the east" = "eastward, on the east side" (Gen 3:21; 12:8; Num 34:11; Josh 7:2; Ezek 11:23). Because the morning sun rise beat down upon Jonah (v. 8) and because the main city gate of Nineveh opened to the east, the term probably means "on the east side" of the city. But "in front of" the city would mean the same in this case.<br>
 <a name="fn164" href="jon.htm#fnB164"><sup>17</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:5)  Apparently Jonah hoped that he might have persuaded the <b>LORD</b> to "change his mind" again (see 3:8-10) and to judge Nineveh after all!<br>

 <a name="fn167" href="jon.htm#fnB167"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tc</b> (4:6)  The consonantal form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lyxhl</FONT> is vocalized by the MT as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lyX!h^l!</FONT>, Hiphil infinitive construct from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lxn</FONT> ("to deliver, rescue") (BDB 664-65). However, the LXX's <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tou skiazein</FONT> ("to shade") reflects an alternate vocalization tradition of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lyx@h*l=</FONT>, Niphal infinitive construct from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">llx</FONT> ("to shade") (see BDB 853). The MT vocalization is preferred for several reasons. First, it is the more difficult form with the assimilated <i>nun</i>. Second, the presence of the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lx</FONT> just two words previous helps to explain the origin of the LXX vocalization which was influenced by this noun in the immediate context. Third, God's primary motivation in giving the plant to Jonah was not simply to provide shade for him because the next day the <b>LORD</b> killed the plant (v. 7). God's primary motivation was to create a situation to "rescue" Jonah from his bad attitude. Nevertheless, the narrator's choice of the somewhat ambiguous form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lyxhl</FONT> might have been motivated to create a wordplay on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lxn</FONT> ("to rescue, deliver") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">llx</FONT> ("to shade"). Jonah thought that God was providing him shade--but God was really working to deliver him from his evil attitude, as the ensuing dialogue indicates.<br>

The meaning of the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hur</FONT> is intentionally ambiguous; the author puns on its broad range of meanings to create a polysemantic wordplay. The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hur</FONT> has a broad range of meanings: (1) "distress, misery, discomfort" (2) "misfortune, injury," (3) "calamity, disaster," (4) "moral evil,"  and (5) "ill-disposed, evil attitude" (see BDB 949; <i>HALOT</i> 3:1262-63). The narrator has used several meanings of  <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hur</FONT> in 3:8-4:2, namely, "moral evil" (3:8, 10) and "calamity, disaster" (3:9, 10; 4:2), as well as the related root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">uur</FONT> "to be displeasing" (4:1). Here the narrator puns on the meaning "discomfort" created by the scorching desert heat, but God's primary motivation is to "deliver" Jonah--not from something as trivial as physical discomfort from heat--but from his sinful attitude about God's willingness to spare Nineveh. This  gives the term an especially ironic twist: Jonah is only concerned about being delivered from his physical "discomfort," while God wants to deliver him from his "evil attitude."<br>
 <a name="fn169" href="jon.htm#fnB169"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:6)  <i>Heb</i> "he rejoiced with great joy."

This cognate accusative construction ironically mirrors the identical syntax of v. 1, "he was angry with great anger." The narrator  repeated this construction to emphasize the contrast between Jonah's anger that Nineveh was spared and his joy that his discomfort was relieved.<br>
 <a name="fn170" href="jon.htm#fnB170"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:7)  Or "appointed." The Piel stem verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnm</FONT> means "to send, to appoint" (Ps 61:8; Jonah 2:1; 4:6-8; Dan 1:5, 10-11) (<i>HALOT</i> 2:599.2; BDB 584).<br>

 <a name="fn172" href="jon.htm#fnB172"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tc</b> (4:8)  The MT adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tyvyrj</FONT> ("autumnal") is a <i>hapax legomenon</i> with an unclear meaning (BDB 362); therefore, the <i>BHS</i> editors propose a conjectural emendation to the adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">typyrj</FONT> ("autumnal") from the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[rj</FONT> ("autumn") (see BDB 358). However, this emendation would also create a <i>hapax legomenon</i> and it would be no more clear than relating the MT's <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tyvyrj</FONT> "autumnal" to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vrj</FONT> I "to plough" [in autumn harvest]).<br>
 <b>tn</b> (4:8)  <i>Heb</i> "autumnal" or "sultry." The adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tyvyrj</FONT>  is a <i>hapax legomenon</i> whose meaning is unclear; it might mean "autumnal" (from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vrj</FONT> I "to plough" [in the autumn harvest-time]),  "silent" = "sultry" (from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vrj</FONT> IV "to be silent") (BDB 362). The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tyvyrj</FONT> might be an alternate spelling of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tysyrj</FONT> from the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">srj</FONT> "sun" and so mean "hot" (BDB 362).<br>

 <a name="fn178" href="jon.htm#fnB178"><sup>31</sup></a> <b>tn</b> (4:9)  <i>Heb</i> "unto death." The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twm-du</FONT> ("unto death") is an idiomatic expression meaning "to the extreme" or simply "extremely [angry]" (<i>HALOT</i> 2:563.1.c). The nouns <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twm</FONT> ("death") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lwav</FONT> ("Sheol") are often used as an absolute superlative with a negative sense, similar to the English expression "bored to death" (<i>IBHS</i> 14.5.b, p. 269). For example, "his soul was vexed to death" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twml</FONT>) means that he could no longer endure it (Judg 16:16);  and  "love is as strong as death" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twmk</FONT>) means love is irresistible or exceedingly strong (Song 8:6). Here the expression "I am angry unto death" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twm-du</FONT>) means that Jonah could not be more angry. Unfortunately, this idiomatic expression has gone undetected by virtually every other major English translation to date (KJV, NKJV, RSV, NRSV, ASV, NASV, NIV, NIB, NJB, JPS, NJPS). The only translation that comes close to representing the idiom correctly is BBE: "I have a right to be <i>truly </i>angry."<br>
 <a name="fn179" href="jon.htm#fnB179"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:10)  <i>Heb</i> "were troubled." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">swj</FONT> has a basic three-fold range of meanings: (1) "to be troubled about," (2) "to look with compassion upon," and (3) "to show pity, to spare [someone from death/judgment]" (<i>HALOT</i> 1:298; BDB 299). Clearly, here God is referring to Jonah's remorse and anger when the plant died (vv. 7-9), so here it means "to be troubled about" (<i>HALOT</i> 1:298.1.c) rather than "to pity" (BDB 299.c). Elsewhere <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">swj</FONT> ("to be troubled about") describes emotional grief caused by the loss of property (Gen 45:20) and the death of family members (Deut 13:9). The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">swj</FONT> is derived from a common Semitic root which has a basic meaning "to pour out; to flow" which is used in reference to emotion and tears in particular. This is seen in the Hebrew expression <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/yu swjt</FONT> ("the eyes flow") picturing tears of concern and grief (e.g., Gen 45:20; Deut 13:19). The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">swj</FONT> will be used again in v. 11 but in a different sense (see note on v. 11).<br>
 <a name="fn180" href="jon.htm#fnB180"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:10)  The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/wyqyq</FONT> ("plant") has the suffixed ending <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/w</FONT>- which denotes a diminutive (see <i>IBHS</i> 5.7.b); so it can be nuanced "little plant." The contrast between Jonah's concern for his "little" plant (v. 10) and God's concern about this "enormous" city (v. 11) could not be greater! Jonah's misplaced priorities look exceedingly foolish and self-centered in comparison to God's global concern about the fate of 120,000 pagans.<br>
 <a name="fn181" href="jon.htm#fnB181"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:10) <i> Heb</i> "which was a son of a night and perished [as] a son of a night."<br>
 <a name="fn182" href="jon.htm#fnB182"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:11)  The emphatic use of the independent pronouns "you" and "I" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hT*a^</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn]a&amp;</FONT>) in vv. 10, 11creates an ironic comparison and emphasizes the strong contrast  between the attitudes of Jonah and the <b>LORD</b>. <br>
 <a name="fn183" href="jon.htm#fnB183"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:11) <i> Heb</i> "You...Should I not spare...?" This is an <i>a fortiori</i> argument from lesser to greater. Since Jonah was "upset" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">swj</FONT>) about such a trivial matter as the death of a little plant (the lesser), God had every right to "spare" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">swj</FONT>) the enormously populated city of Nineveh (the greater). The phrase "even more" does not appear in Hebrew but is implied by this <i>a priori</i> argument.<br>
 <a name="fn184" href="jon.htm#fnB184"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:11)  <i>Heb</i> "Should I not spare?" Or "Should I not show compassion?" The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">swj</FONT> has a basic three-fold range of meanings: (1) "to be troubled about," (2) "to look with compassion upon," and (3) "to show pity, to spare (someone from death/judgment)" (<i>HALOT</i> 1:298; BDB 299). In v. 10 it refer to Jonah's lament over the death of his plant, meaning "to be upset about" or "to be troubled about" (<i>HALOT</i> 1:298.1.c). However, here in v. 11 it means "to show pity, spare" from judgment (BDB 298.b; <i>HALOT</i> 1:298.1.a) (e.g., 1 Sam 24:11; Jer 21:7; Ezek 24:14). The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">swj</FONT> "to spare (from judgment) is often used in contexts which contemplate whether God will or will not spare a sinful people from judgment (Ezek 5:11; 7:4, 9; 8:19; 9:5, 10; 20:17). So this repetition of the same verb but in a different sense creates a polysemantic wordplay in vv. 10-11. However, the wordplay is obscured by the appropriate translation for each usage--"be upset about"  in v. 10 and "to spare" in v. 11--therefore, the translation above attempts to bring out the wordplay in English: "to be [even more] concerned about." <br>
 <a name="fn185" href="jon.htm#fnB185"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:11) <i> Heb</i> "the great city."<br>
 <a name="fn186" href="jon.htm#fnB186"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:11)  <i>Heb</i> "their right from their left."  Interpreters wonder exactly what deficiency is meant by the phrase "do not know their right from their left." The expression does not appear elsewhere in biblical Hebrew. It probably does not mean, as sometimes suggested, that Nineveh had 120,000 small children (the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;d&#180;a*</FONT> ["people"] does not seem to be used of children alone). In any case, it refers to a deficiency in discernment that Jonah and the initial readers of Jonah would no doubt have considered themselves free of. For partial parallels see 2 Sam 19:35; Eccl 10:2; Ezek 22:26; 44:23.<br>
