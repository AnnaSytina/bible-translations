<bqverse 27>27  Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters. But his brothers did not have many sons, so their whole clan was not as numerous as the sons of Judah.

Their extended families increased greatly in numbers. 
<bqverse 39>39  They went to the entrance of Gedor, to the east of the valley, looking for pasture for their sheep. 
<bqverse 40>40  They found fertile and rich pasture; the land was very broad, undisturbed and peaceful. Indeed some Hamites had been living there prior to that.

<bqverse 3>3  The battle was thick<a name="fnB202" href="1ch_note.htm#fn202"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> around Saul; the archers overtook him and wounded him.<a name="fnB203" href="1ch_note.htm#fn203"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  Saul told his armor bearer, "Draw your sword and stab me with it, so these uncircumcised people won't be able to torture me."<a name="fnB204" href="1ch_note.htm#fn204"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> But the armor bearer refused to do it, because he was very afraid. So Saul took the sword and fell on it. 
<bqverse 5>5  When the armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died. 
<bqverse 6>6  So Saul and his three sons died; his whole household<a name="fnB205" href="1ch_note.htm#fn205"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> died together. 
<bqverse 7>7  When all the Israelites who were in the valley saw that the army<a name="fnB206" href="1ch_note.htm#fn206"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled.

<bqverse 9>9  They stripped his corpse, and then carried off his head and his armor. The sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines proclaiming the news to their idols and their people.

<bqverse 11>11  This is the list of David's warriors:<a name="fnB228" href="1ch_note.htm#fn228"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a><p>
Jashobeam, a Hacmonite, was head of the officers.<a name="fnB229" href="1ch_note.htm#fn229"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> He killed three hundred men with his spear in a single battle.<a name="fnB230" href="1ch_note.htm#fn230"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 12>12  Next in command<a name="fnB231" href="1ch_note.htm#fn231"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite. He was one of the three elite warriors.

<bqverse 15>15  Three of the thirty leaders went down to David at the rocky cliff at the cave of Adullam, while a Philistine force was camped in the Valley of Rephaim. 
<bqverse 16>16  David was in the stronghold, while a Philistine garrison was in Bethlehem. 
<bqverse 17>17  David was thirsty and said, "How I wish someone would give me some water to drink<a name="fnB235" href="1ch_note.htm#fn235"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> from the cistern in Bethlehem near the gate!"

<bqverse 15>15  They crossed the Jordan River<a name="fnB257" href="1ch_note.htm#fn257"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> in the first month,<a name="fnB258" href="1ch_note.htm#fn258"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> when it was overflowing its banks, and routed those living in all the valleys to the east and west.<a name="fnB259" href="1ch_note.htm#fn259"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 16>16  Some from Benjamin and Judah also came to David's stronghold. 
<bqverse 17>17  David went out to meet them and said,<a name="fnB260" href="1ch_note.htm#fn260"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> "If you come to me in peace and want to help me, then I will make an alliance with you.<a name="fnB261" href="1ch_note.htm#fn261"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> But if you come to betray me to my enemies when I have not harmed you,<a name="fnB262" href="1ch_note.htm#fn262"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> may the God of our ancestors<a name="fnB263" href="1ch_note.htm#fn263"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> take notice and judge!" 
<bqverse 18>18  But a spirit<a name="fnB264" href="1ch_note.htm#fn264"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> empowered<a name="fnB265" href="1ch_note.htm#fn265"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> Amasai, the leader of the thirty warriors, and he said:<a name="fnB266" href="1ch_note.htm#fn266"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> <p>
"We are yours, O David! <p>

So David accepted them and made them leaders of raiding bands.<p>

<bqverse 21>21  They helped David fight against raiding bands, for all of them were warriors and leaders in the army.

<bqverse 40>40  Also their neighbors, from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, were bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen.

<bqverse 2>2  David said to the whole Israelite assembly, "If you so desire and the LORD our God approves,<a name="fnB289" href="1ch_note.htm#fn289"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> let's spread the word<a name="fnB290" href="1ch_note.htm#fn290"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> to our brothers who remain in all the regions of Israel, and to the priests and Levites in their cities,<a name="fnB291" href="1ch_note.htm#fn291"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> so they may join us.

<bqverse 4>4  The whole assembly agreed to do this,<a name="fnB295" href="1ch_note.htm#fn295"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> for the proposal seemed right to all the people.<a name="fnB296" href="1ch_note.htm#fn296"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  So David assembled all Israel from the Shihor River<a name="fnB297" href="1ch_note.htm#fn297"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> in Egypt to Lebo Hamath,<a name="fnB298" href="1ch_note.htm#fn298"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim. 
<bqverse 6>6  David and all Israel went up to Baalah (that is, Kiriath Jearim) in Judah to bring up from there the ark of God the LORD, who sits enthroned between the cherubim--the ark that is called by his name.<a name="fnB299" href="1ch_note.htm#fn299"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 7>7  They transported the ark on a new cart from the house of Abinadab; Uzza and Ahio were guiding the cart, 
<bqverse 8>8  while David and all Israel were energetically<a name="fnB300" href="1ch_note.htm#fn300"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> celebrating before God, singing and playing various stringed instruments,<a name="fnB301" href="1ch_note.htm#fn301"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets. 
<bqverse 9>9  When they arrived at the threshing floor of Kidon, Uzza reached out his hand to grab hold of<a name="fnB302" href="1ch_note.htm#fn302"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> the ark, because the oxen stumbled. 
<bqverse 10>10  The LORD was so furious with Uzza,<a name="fnB303" href="1ch_note.htm#fn303"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> he killed him, because he reached out his hand and touched the ark.<a name="fnB304" href="1ch_note.htm#fn304"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> He died right there before God.<a name="fnB305" href="1ch_note.htm#fn305"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 11>11  David was angry because the LORD attacked Uzza;<a name="fnB306" href="1ch_note.htm#fn306"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> so he called that place Perez Uzza,<a name="fnB307" href="1ch_note.htm#fn307"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> which remains its name to this very day. 
<bqverse 12>12  David was afraid of God that day and said, "How will I ever be able to bring the ark of God up here?" 
<bqverse 13>13  So David did not move the ark to the City of David;<a name="fnB308" href="1ch_note.htm#fn308"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> he left it in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. 
<bqverse 14>14  The ark of God remained in Obed-Edom's house for three months; the LORD blessed Obed-Edom's family and all that belonged to him.

<p><i>David</i>'<i>s Prestige Grows</i>
<p><A NAME="14"><b>

<bqverse 2>2  David realized that the LORD had established him as king over Israel and that his kingdom had become prominent<a name="fnB310" href="1ch_note.htm#fn310"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> for the sake of his people Israel.<p>

<bqverse 3>3  In Jerusalem David married<a name="fnB311" href="1ch_note.htm#fn311"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> more wives and fathered more sons and daughters. 
<bqverse 4>4 These are the names of children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
<bqverse 5>5  Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 
<bqverse 6>6  Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,

<bqverse 8>8  When the Philistines heard that David had been designated<a name="fnB313" href="1ch_note.htm#fn313"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> king of all Israel, all the Philistines marched up to confront him.<a name="fnB314" href="1ch_note.htm#fn314"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> When David heard about it, he marched out against<a name="fnB315" href="1ch_note.htm#fn315"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> them. 
<bqverse 9>9  Now the Philistines had come and raided<a name="fnB316" href="1ch_note.htm#fn316"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> the Valley of Rephaim. 
<bqverse 10>10  David asked God, "Should I march up against the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?" The LORD said to him, "March up! I will hand them over to you!" 
<bqverse 11>11  So they marched against Baal Perazim and David defeated them there. David said, "Using me as his instrument,<a name="fnB317" href="1ch_note.htm#fn317"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> God has burst out against my enemies like water bursts out." So that place is called Baal Perazim.<a name="fnB318" href="1ch_note.htm#fn318"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  The Philistines abandoned their idols<a name="fnB319" href="1ch_note.htm#fn319"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> there, so David ordered that they be burned.<p>

<bqverse 13>13  The Philistines again raided the valley. 
<bqverse 14>14  So David again asked God what he should do.<a name="fnB320" href="1ch_note.htm#fn320"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> God told him, "Don't march up behind them; circle around them and meet them in front of the trees.<a name="fnB321" href="1ch_note.htm#fn321"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 16>16  David did just as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer.<p>

<bqverse 2>2  Then David said, "Only the Levites may carry the ark of God, for the LORD chose them to carry the ark of the LORD and to serve before him perpetually. 
<bqverse 3>3  David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring the ark of the LORD up to the place he had prepared for it. 
<bqverse 4>4  David gathered together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:<p>

<bqverse 5>5  From the descendants of Kohath: Uriel the leader and 120 of his relatives.<p>

<bqverse 10>10  From the descendants of Uzziel: Amminadab the leader and 112 of his relatives.<p>

<bqverse 11>11  David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar, along with the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab. 
<bqverse 12>12  He told them: "You are the leaders of the Levites' families. You and your relatives must consecrate yourselves and bring the ark of the LORD God of Israel up to the place I have prepared for it. 
<bqverse 13>13  The first time you did not carry it; that is why the LORD God attacked us, because we did not ask him about the proper way to carry it."<a name="fnB327" href="1ch_note.htm#fn327"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  The priests and Levites consecrated themselves so they could bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel. 
<bqverse 15>15  The descendants of Levi carried the ark of God on their shoulders with poles, just as Moses had ordered according to the divine command.<p>

<bqverse 16>16  David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint some of their relatives as musicians; they were to play various instruments, including stringed instruments and cymbals, and to sing loudly and joyfully.<a name="fnB328" href="1ch_note.htm#fn328"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; one of his relatives, Asaph son of Berekiah; one of the descendants of Merari,<a name="fnB329" href="1ch_note.htm#fn329"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> Ethan son of Kushaiah;

<bqverse 25>25  So David, the leaders of Israel, and the commanders of units of a thousand went to bring up the ark of the LORD's covenant from the house of Obed-Edom with celebration. 
<bqverse 26>26  When God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the LORD's covenant, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams. 
<bqverse 27>27  David was wrapped in a linen robe, as were all the Levites carrying the ark, the musicians, and Kenaniah the supervisor of transport and the musicians;<a name="fnB337" href="1ch_note.htm#fn337"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> David also wore a linen ephod.<a name="fnB338" href="1ch_note.htm#fn338"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  All Israel brought up the ark of the LORD's covenant; they were shouting, blowing trumpets, sounding cymbals, and playing stringed instruments.

<p><i>David</i>'<i>s Campaign Against the Ammonites</i>
<p><A NAME="19"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Later King Nahash of the Ammonites died and his son succeeded him. 
<bqverse 2>2  David said, "I will express my loyalty<a name="fnB454" href="1ch_note.htm#fn454"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> to Hanun son of Nahash, for his father was loyal<a name="fnB455" href="1ch_note.htm#fn455"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> to me." So David sent messengers to express his sympathy over his father's death;<a name="fnB456" href="1ch_note.htm#fn456"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> David's servants traveled to Ammonite territory to visit Hanun and express the king's sympathy.<a name="fnB457" href="1ch_note.htm#fn457"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  The Ammonite officials said to Hanun, "Do you really think David is trying to honor your father by sending these messengers to express his sympathy?<a name="fnB458" href="1ch_note.htm#fn458"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> No, his servants have come to you so they can get information and spy out the land!"<a name="fnB459" href="1ch_note.htm#fn459"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  So Hanun seized David's servants and shaved their beards off.<a name="fnB460" href="1ch_note.htm#fn460"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> He cut off the lower part of their robes so that their buttocks were exposed<a name="fnB461" href="1ch_note.htm#fn461"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> and then sent them away. 
<bqverse 5>5  Messengers<a name="fnB462" href="1ch_note.htm#fn462"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> came and told David what had happened to the men, so he summoned them, for they<a name="fnB463" href="1ch_note.htm#fn463"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> were thoroughly humiliated. The king said, "Stay in Jericho until your beards grow again; then you may come back."<p>

<bqverse 6>6  When the Ammonites realized that David was disgusted with them,<a name="fnB464" href="1ch_note.htm#fn464"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand units<a name="fnB465" href="1ch_note.htm#fn465"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Aram Naharaim, Aram Maacah, and Zobah. 
<bqverse 7>7  They hired thirty-two thousand chariots, along with the king of Maacah and his army, who came and camped in front of Medeba. The Ammonites also assembled from their cities and marched out to do battle.<p>

<bqverse 8>8  When David heard the news, he sent Joab and the entire army to meet them.<a name="fnB466" href="1ch_note.htm#fn466"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  The Ammonites marched out and were deployed for battle at the entrance to the city, while the kings who had come were by themselves in the field. 
<bqverse 10>10  When Joab saw that the battle would be fought on two fronts, he chose some of Israel's best men and deployed them against the Arameans.<a name="fnB467" href="1ch_note.htm#fn467"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  He put his brother Abishai in charge of the rest of the army and they were deployed against the Ammonites. 
<bqverse 12>12  Joab<a name="fnB468" href="1ch_note.htm#fn468"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> said, "If the Arameans start to overpower me,<a name="fnB469" href="1ch_note.htm#fn469"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> you come to my rescue. If the Ammonites start to overpower you,<a name="fnB470" href="1ch_note.htm#fn470"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> I will deliver you. 
<bqverse 13>13  Be strong! Let's fight bravely for the sake of our people and the cities of our God! The LORD will do what he decides is best."<a name="fnB471" href="1ch_note.htm#fn471"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  So Joab and his men<a name="fnB472" href="1ch_note.htm#fn472"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> marched towards the Arameans to do battle, and they fled before him. 
<bqverse 15>15  When the Ammonites saw the Arameans flee, they fled before his brother Abishai and withdrew into the city. Joab went back to Jerusalem.<p>

<bqverse 16>16  When the Arameans realized they had been defeated by Israel, they sent for reinforcements from beyond the Euphrates River,<a name="fnB473" href="1ch_note.htm#fn473"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> led by Shophach the general of Hadadezer's army.<a name="fnB474" href="1ch_note.htm#fn474"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  When David was informed, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan River,<a name="fnB475" href="1ch_note.htm#fn475"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> and marched against them.<a name="fnB476" href="1ch_note.htm#fn476"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> David deployed his army against the Arameans for battle and they fought against him.<a name="fnB477" href="1ch_note.htm#fn477"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  The Arameans fled before Israel. David killed seven thousand Aramean charioteers and forty thousand infantrymen; he also killed Shophach the general. 
<bqverse 19>19  When Hadadezer's subjects saw they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became his subjects. The Arameans were no longer willing to help the Ammonites.<p>

He went and besieged Rabbah, while David stayed in Jerusalem. Joab defeated Rabbah and tore it down. 
<bqverse 2>2  David took the crown from the head of their king<a name="fnB479" href="1ch_note.htm#fn479"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> (its weight was a unit<a name="fnB480" href="1ch_note.htm#fn480"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> of gold and it was set with precious stones) and wore it.<a name="fnB481" href="1ch_note.htm#fn481"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> He took a large amount of plunder from the city.

At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the Rephaim, and the Philistines<a name="fnB484" href="1ch_note.htm#fn484"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> were subdued. <p>

<bqverse 5>5  There was another battle with the Philistines in which Elhanan son of Jair the Bethlehemite killed the brother of Goliath the Gittite,<a name="fnB485" href="1ch_note.htm#fn485"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> whose spear had a shaft as big as the crossbeam of a weaver's loom.<p>

<p><i>The Lord Sends a Plague Against Israel</i>

<bqverse 2>2  David told Joab and the leaders of the army,<a name="fnB491" href="1ch_note.htm#fn491"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> "Go, count the number of warriors<a name="fnB492" href="1ch_note.htm#fn492"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> from Beersheba to Dan.

<bqverse 3>3  Joab replied, "May the LORD make his army<a name="fnB494" href="1ch_note.htm#fn494"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> a hundred times larger! My master, O king, do not all of them serve my master? Why does my master want to do this? Why bring judgment on Israel?"<a name="fnB495" href="1ch_note.htm#fn495"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 4>4  But the king's edict stood, despite Joab's objections.<a name="fnB496" href="1ch_note.htm#fn496"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> So Joab left and traveled throughout Israel before returning to Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 5>5  Joab reported to David the number of warriors.<a name="fnB497" href="1ch_note.htm#fn497"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand<a name="fnB498" href="1ch_note.htm#fn498"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> sword-wielding soldiers; Judah alone had four hundred seventy thousand sword-wielding soldiers. 
<bqverse 6>6  Now Joab<a name="fnB499" href="1ch_note.htm#fn499"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> did not number Levi and Benjamin, for the king's edict disgusted him. 
<bqverse 7>7  God was also offended by it,<a name="fnB500" href="1ch_note.htm#fn500"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> so he attacked Israel.<p>

<bqverse 8>8  David said to God, "I have sinned greatly by doing this. Now, please remove the guilt of your servant, for I have acted very foolishly." 
<bqverse 9>9  The LORD told Gad, David's prophet,<a name="fnB501" href="1ch_note.htm#fn501"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  "Go, tell David, `This is what the LORD says: "I am offering you three forms of judgment from which to choose. Pick one of them."'"<a name="fnB502" href="1ch_note.htm#fn502"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  Gad went to David and told him, "This is what the LORD says: `Pick one of these: 
<bqverse 12>12  three years of famine, or three months being chased by your enemies and struck down by their swords,<a name="fnB503" href="1ch_note.htm#fn503"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> or three days being struck down by the LORD, during which a plague will invade the land and the LORD's messenger will destroy throughout Israel's territory.'<a name="fnB504" href="1ch_note.htm#fn504"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> Now, decide what I should tell the one who sent me." 
<bqverse 13>13  David said to Gad, "I am very upset. I prefer to be attacked by the LORD, for his mercy is very great; I do not want to be attacked by men."<a name="fnB505" href="1ch_note.htm#fn505"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  So the LORD sent a plague through Israel, and seventy thousand Israelite men died. <p>

<bqverse 15>15  God sent a messenger<a name="fnB506" href="1ch_note.htm#fn506"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> to ravage<a name="fnB507" href="1ch_note.htm#fn507"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> Jerusalem.

The LORD's messenger was standing near the threshing floor of Ornan<a name="fnB514" href="1ch_note.htm#fn514"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> the Jebusite. 
<bqverse 16>16  David looked up and saw the LORD's messenger standing between the earth and sky with his sword drawn and in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem. David and the leaders, covered with sackcloth, threw themselves down with their faces to the ground.<a name="fnB515" href="1ch_note.htm#fn515"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  David said to God, "Was I not the one who decided to number the army? I am one who sinned and committed this awful deed!<a name="fnB516" href="1ch_note.htm#fn516"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> As for these sheep, what have they done?

<bqverse 18>18  So the LORD's messenger told Gad to instruct David to go up and build<a name="fnB519" href="1ch_note.htm#fn519"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> an altar for the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 
<bqverse 19>19  So David went up as Gad instructed him to do in the name of the LORD.<a name="fnB520" href="1ch_note.htm#fn520"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  While Ornan was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the messenger, and he and his four sons hid themselves. 
<bqverse 21>21  When David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David; he came out from the threshing floor and bowed to David with his face<a name="fnB521" href="1ch_note.htm#fn521"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> to the ground. 
<bqverse 22>22  David said to Ornan, "Sell me the threshing floor<a name="fnB522" href="1ch_note.htm#fn522"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> so I can build<a name="fnB523" href="1ch_note.htm#fn523"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> on it an altar for the LORD--I'll pay top price<a name="fnB524" href="1ch_note.htm#fn524"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a>--so the plague may be removed<a name="fnB525" href="1ch_note.htm#fn525"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> from the people." 
<bqverse 23>23  Ornan told David, "You can have it!<a name="fnB526" href="1ch_note.htm#fn526"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> My master, the king, may do what he wants.<a name="fnB527" href="1ch_note.htm#fn527"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> Look, I am giving you the oxen for burnt sacrifices, the threshing sledges for wood, and the wheat for an offering. I give it all to you." 
<bqverse 24>24  King David replied to Ornan, "No, I insist on buying it for top price.<a name="fnB528" href="1ch_note.htm#fn528"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> I will not offer to the LORD what belongs to you or offer a burnt sacrifice that cost me nothing.<a name="fnB529" href="1ch_note.htm#fn529"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  So David bought the place from Ornan for six hundred pieces of gold.<a name="fnB530" href="1ch_note.htm#fn530"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  David built there an altar for the LORD and offered burnt sacrifices and tokens of peace.<a name="fnB531" href="1ch_note.htm#fn531"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> He called out to the LORD, and the LORD<a name="fnB532" href="1ch_note.htm#fn532"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> responded by sending fire from the sky and consuming the burnt sacrifice on the altar. 
<bqverse 27>27  The LORD ordered the messenger<a name="fnB533" href="1ch_note.htm#fn533"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> to put his sword back into its sheath.<p>

<bqverse 28>28  At that time, when David saw that the LORD responded to him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there. 
<bqverse 29>29  Now the LORD's tabernacle, which Moses had made in the desert, and the altar for burnt sacrifices were at that time at the worship center<a name="fnB534" href="1ch_note.htm#fn534"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> in Gibeon. 
<bqverse 30>30  But David could not go before it to seek God's will, for he was afraid of the sword of the LORD's messenger.

<p>
<bqverse 2>2  David ordered the resident foreigners in the land of Israel to be called together. He appointed some of them to be stonecutters to chisel stones for the building of God's temple. 
<bqverse 3>3  David supplied a large amount of iron for the nails of the doors of the gates and for braces, more bronze than could be weighed, 
<bqverse 4>4  and more cedar logs than could be counted. (The Sidonians and Tyrians had brought a large amount of cedar logs to David.)<p>

<bqverse 5>5  David said, "My son Solomon is just an inexperienced young man,<a name="fnB535" href="1ch_note.htm#fn535"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> and the temple to be built for the LORD must be especially magnificent so it will become famous and be considered splendid by all the nations.<a name="fnB536" href="1ch_note.htm#fn536"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> Therefore I will make preparations for its construction."

<bqverse 6>6  He summoned his son Solomon and charged him to build a temple for the LORD God of Israel.

<bqverse 2>2  David<a name="fnB567" href="1ch_note.htm#fn567"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> assembled all the leaders of Israel, along with the priests and the Levites.

<bqverse 6>6  David divided them into groups corresponding to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.<p>

<bqverse 7>7  The Gershonites included Ladan and Shimei.<p>

<bqverse 8>8  The sons of Ladan:<p>
Jehiel the oldest, Zetham, and Joel--three in all.<p>

<bqverse 9>9  The sons of Shimei:<p>

Jahath, Zina,<a name="fnB571" href="1ch_note.htm#fn571"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> Jeush, and Beriah. These were Shimei's sons--four in all.<a name="fnB572" href="1ch_note.htm#fn572"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  Jahath was the oldest and Zizah the second oldest. Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they were considered one family with one responsibility.<p>

<bqverse 12>12  The sons of Kohath:<p>
Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel--four in all.<p>

<bqverse 13>13  The sons of Amram:<p>
Aaron and Moses.<p>
Aaron and his descendants were chosen on a permanent basis to consecrate the most holy items, to offer sacrifices before the LORD, to serve him, and to praise his name.<a name="fnB573" href="1ch_note.htm#fn573"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a>

Micah the oldest, and Isshiah the second.<p>

<bqverse 21>21  The sons of Merari:<p>
Machli and Mushi.<p>
The sons of Machli:<p>
Eleazar and Kish. <p>

<bqverse 27>27  According to David's final instructions, the Levites twenty years of age and up were counted.<a name="fnB580" href="1ch_note.htm#fn580"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 28>28  Their job was to help Aaron's descendants in the service of the LORD's temple.

<bqverse 31>31  and whenever burnt sacrifices were offered to the LORD on the Sabbath and at new moon festivals and assemblies. A designated number were to serve before the LORD regularly in accordance with regulations.<a name="fnB585" href="1ch_note.htm#fn585"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 32>32  They were in charge of the meeting tent and the holy place, and helped their relatives, the descendants of Aaron, in the service of the LORD's temple.<a name="fnB586" href="1ch_note.htm#fn586"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>David Commissions Solomon to Build the Temple</i>
<p><A NAME="28"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> David assembled in Jerusalem all the officials of Israel, including the commanders of the tribes, the commanders of the army divisions that served the king, the commanders of units of a thousand and a hundred, the officials who were in charge of all the property and livestock of the king and his sons, the eunuchs, and the warriors, including the most skilled of them. <p>

<bqverse 2>2  King David rose to his feet and said: "Listen to me, my brothers and my people. I wanted to build a temple where the ark of the LORD's covenant could be placed as a footstool for our God.<a name="fnB642" href="1ch_note.htm#fn642"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> I have made the preparations for building it. 
<bqverse 3>3  But God said to me, `You must not build a temple to honor me,<a name="fnB643" href="1ch_note.htm#fn643"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> for you are a warrior and have spilled blood.' 
<bqverse 4>4  The LORD God of Israel chose me out of my father's entire family to become king over Israel and have a permanent dynasty.<a name="fnB644" href="1ch_note.htm#fn644"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> Indeed<a name="fnB645" href="1ch_note.htm#fn645"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> he chose Judah as leader, and my father's family within Judah, and then he picked me out from among my father's sons and made me king over all Israel.<a name="fnB646" href="1ch_note.htm#fn646"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  From all the many sons the LORD has given me, he chose Solomon my son to rule on his behalf over Israel.<a name="fnB647" href="1ch_note.htm#fn647"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  He said to me, `Solomon your son is the one who will build my temple and my courts, for I have chosen him to become my son and I will become his father.

With pure motives<a name="fnB690" href="1ch_note.htm#fn690"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> I contribute all this; and now I look with joy as your people who have gathered here contribute to you. 
<bqverse 18>18  O LORD God of our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, maintain the motives of your people and keep them devoted to you.<a name="fnB691" href="1ch_note.htm#fn691"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  Make my son Solomon willing to obey your commands, rules, and regulations, and to complete building the palace for which I have made preparations."<a name="fnB692" href="1ch_note.htm#fn692"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a><p>

Then they designated Solomon, David's son, as king a second time;<a name="fnB695" href="1ch_note.htm#fn695"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> before the LORD they anointed him as ruler and Zadok as priest. 
<bqverse 23>23  Solomon sat on the LORD's throne as king in place of his father David; he was successful and all Israel was loyal to him.<a name="fnB696" href="1ch_note.htm#fn696"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a>
