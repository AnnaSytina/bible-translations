<bqverse 1>1 </b> From Paul<a name="fnB0" href="phi_note.htm#fn0"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> and Timothy, slaves<a name="fnB1" href="phi_note.htm#fn1"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers<a name="fnB2" href="phi_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> and deacons.

<p><i>Prayer for the Church</i>
<p>
<bqverse 3>3  I thank my God every time I remember you.<a name="fnB4" href="phi_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  I always pray with joy in my every prayer for you all 
<bqverse 5>5  because of your participation<a name="fnB5" href="phi_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> in the gospel from the first day until now.<a name="fnB6" href="phi_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  For I am sure of this very thing,<a name="fnB7" href="phi_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> that the one<a name="fnB8" href="phi_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> who began a good work in<a name="fnB9" href="phi_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> you will perfect it<a name="fnB10" href="phi_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> until the day of Christ Jesus. 
<bqverse 7>7  For<a name="fnB11" href="phi_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> it is right for me to think this about all of you, because I have you in my heart,<a name="fnB12" href="phi_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> since both in my imprisonment<a name="fnB13" href="phi_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel all of you became partners together with me in the grace of God.<a name="fnB14" href="phi_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  For God is my witness that I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus. 
<bqverse 9>9  And I pray this, that your love may abound even more and more in knowledge and every kind of insight 
<bqverse 10>10 so that you can decide what is best, and thus be sincere and blameless for the day of Christ,
<bqverse 11>11  filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.</p>

<p>
<bqverse 12>12  I want you to know, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB15" href="phi_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> that my situation has actually turned out to advance the gospel:<a name="fnB16" href="phi_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 13>13  the<a name="fnB17" href="phi_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> whole imperial guard<a name="fnB18" href="phi_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> and everyone else knows<a name="fnB19" href="phi_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> that I am in prison<a name="fnB20" href="phi_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> for the sake of Christ, 
<bqverse 14>14  and most of the brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB21" href="phi_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> having confidence in the Lord<a name="fnB22" href="phi_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> because of my imprisonment, now more than ever<a name="fnB23" href="phi_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> dare to speak the word<a name="fnB24" href="phi_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> fearlessly.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  Some, to be sure, are preaching Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from goodwill.
<bqverse 16>16  The latter do so from love because they know that I am placed here for the defense of the gospel. 
<bqverse 17>17 The former proclaim Christ<a name="fnB25" href="phi_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> from selfish ambition, not sincerely, because they think they can cause trouble for me in my imprisonment.<a name="fnB26" href="phi_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  What is the result? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is being proclaimed, and in this I rejoice.<p>
Yes,<a name="fnB27" href="phi_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> and I will continue to rejoice, 
<bqverse 19>19  for I know that this will turn out for my deliverance<a name="fnB28" href="phi_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. 
<bqverse 20>20  My confident hope<a name="fnB29" href="phi_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> is that I will in no way be ashamed<a name="fnB30" href="phi_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> but that with complete boldness, even now as always, Christ will be exalted in my body, whether I live or die.<a name="fnB31" href="phi_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. 
<bqverse 22>22  Now if I am to go on living in the body,<a name="fnB32" href="phi_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> this will mean productive work<a name="fnB33" href="phi_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> for me, yet I don't know which I prefer:<a name="fnB34" href="phi_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23  I feel torn between the two,<a name="fnB35" href="phi_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> because I have a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far, 
<bqverse 24>24  but it is more vital for your sake that I remain<a name="fnB36" href="phi_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> in the body.<a name="fnB37" href="phi_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 25>25  And since I am sure of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for the sake of your progress<a name="fnB38" href="phi_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> and joy in the faith,<a name="fnB39" href="phi_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 26>26  so that because of me you may swell with pride in Christ Jesus,<a name="fnB40" href="phi_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> when I come back to you.<a name="fnB41" href="phi_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 27>27  Only conduct yourselves<a name="fnB42" href="phi_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ so that--whether I come and see you or whether I remain absent--I should hear that<a name="fnB43" href="phi_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind, by contending side by side for the faith of the gospel,<a name="fnB44" href="phi_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  and by not being intimidated in any way by your opponents. This is<a name="fnB45" href="phi_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> a sign of their<a name="fnB46" href="phi_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> destruction, but of your salvation--a sign which<a name="fnB47" href="phi_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> is from God.
<bqverse 29>29  For it has been granted to you<a name="fnB48" href="phi_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> not only to believe in Christ but also to suffer<b> </b>for him, 
<bqverse 30>30  since you are encountering<a name="fnB49" href="phi_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> the same conflict that you saw me face and now hear that I am facing.<a name="fnB50" href="phi_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Christian Unity and Christ's Humility</i>
<p><A NAME="2"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort provided by love, any fellowship in the Spirit,<a name="fnB51" href="phi_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> any affection or mercy,<a name="fnB52" href="phi_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 2>2  complete my joy and be of the same mind,<a name="fnB53" href="phi_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> by having the same love, being united in spirit,<a name="fnB54" href="phi_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> and having one purpose. 
<bqverse 3>3  Instead of being motivated by selfish ambition<a name="fnB55" href="phi_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> or vanity, each of you should, in humility, be moved to treat one another as more important than yourself. 
<bqverse 4>4  Each of you should be concerned<a name="fnB56" href="phi_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> not only<a name="fnB57" href="phi_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> about your own interests, but about the interests of others as well.<a name="fnB58" href="phi_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5 You should have the same attitude toward one another that Christ Jesus had,<a name="fnB59" href="phi_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> </p>
<br>
<bqverse 6>6 <a name="fnB60" href="phi_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> who though he existed in the form of God<a name="fnB61" href="phi_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> <br>
did not regard equality with God<br>
as something to be grasped, <br>

<bqverse 7>7 but emptied himself<br>
by taking on the form of a slave,<a name="fnB62" href="phi_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a><br>
by looking like other men,<a name="fnB63" href="phi_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a><br>
and by sharing in human nature.<a name="fnB64" href="phi_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 8>8 He humbled himself, <br>
by becoming obedient to the point of death<br>
--even death on a cross!<br>

<bqverse 9>9  As a result God exalted him<br>
and gave him the name<br>
that is above every name,<br>

<bqverse 10>10  so that at the name of Jesus<br>
every knee should bow <br>
--in heaven and on earth and under the earth,<br>

<bqverse 11>11  and every tongue confess<a name="fnB65" href="phi_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> <br>
to the glory of God the Father <br>
that Jesus Christ is Lord.<a name="_Toc403221915"></a><a name="_Toc416894403"></a><a name="_Toc432265266"></a><a name="_Toc485060207"></a><a name="_Toc494013704"></a></ul><p><i>Lights in the World</i>
<p>
<bqverse 12>12  So then, my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence but even more in my absence, continue working out your salvation with awe and reverence,<a name="fnB66" href="phi_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13 for the one bringing forth in you both the desire and the effort--for the sake of his good pleasure--is God. 
<bqverse 14>14 Do everything without grumbling or arguing,
<bqverse 15>15  so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God without blemish though you live in a crooked and perverse society, in which you shine as lights in the world<a name="fnB67" href="phi_note.htm#fn67"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16 by holding on to<a name="fnB68" href="phi_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> the word of life so that on the day of Christ I will have a reason to boast that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain. 
<bqverse 17>17  But even if I am being poured out like a drink-offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I have joy and rejoice together with all of you. 
<bqverse 18>18  And in the same way, you also should be glad and rejoice together with me.<a name="_Toc403221916"></a><a name="_Toc416894404"></a><a name="_Toc432265267"></a><a name="_Toc485060208"></a><a name="_Toc494013705"></a></p>
<p><i>Models for Ministry</i>
<p>
<bqverse 19>19  Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you quickly, so that I too may be encouraged by hearing news about you. 
<bqverse 20>20  For there is no one here like him who will readily demonstrate his deep concern for you.<a name="fnB69" href="phi_note.htm#fn69"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21 Others are busy with their own concerns, not those of Jesus Christ.
<bqverse 22>22  But you know his qualifications, that like a son working with his father, he served with me in advancing the gospel. 
<bqverse 23>23  So I hope to send him as soon as I know more about my situation, 
<bqverse 24>24  though I am confident in the Lord that I too will be coming soon.<p>

<bqverse 25>25 But for now<a name="fnB70" href="phi_note.htm#fn70"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a><b> </b>I have considered it necessary to send Epaphroditus to you. For he is my brother,<a name="fnB71" href="phi_note.htm#fn71"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> coworker and fellow soldier, and your messenger<a name="fnB72" href="phi_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> and minister<a name="fnB73" href="phi_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> to me in my need.<a name="fnB74" href="phi_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  Indeed, he greatly missed all of you and was distressed because you heard that he had been ill. 
<bqverse 27>27  In fact he became so ill that he nearly died.<a name="fnB75" href="phi_note.htm#fn75"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> But God showed mercy to him--and not to him only, but also to me--so that I would not have grief on top of grief. 
<bqverse 28>28  Therefore I am all the more eager to send him,<a name="fnB76" href="phi_note.htm#fn76"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> so that when you see him again you can rejoice<a name="fnB77" href="phi_note.htm#fn77"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> and I can be free from anxiety. 
<bqverse 29>29 So welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like him, 
<bqverse 30>30  since it was because of the work of Christ that he almost died. He risked his life so that he could make up for your inability to serve me.<a name="fnB78" href="phi_note.htm#fn78"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>True and False Righteousness</i>
<p><A NAME="3"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>Finally, my brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB79" href="phi_note.htm#fn79"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> rejoice in the Lord! To write this again is not a bother for me, and it is a safeguard for you.<p>

<bqverse 2>2  Beware of the dogs,<a name="fnB80" href="phi_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> beware of the evil workers, beware of those who mutilate the flesh!<a name="fnB81" href="phi_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  For we are the circumcision,<a name="fnB82" href="phi_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> the ones who worship by the Spirit of God, exult in Christ Jesus, and do not rely on human credentials<a name="fnB83" href="phi_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  --though mine too are significant.<a name="fnB84" href="phi_note.htm#fn84"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> If someone thinks he has good reasons to put confidence in human credentials,<a name="fnB85" href="phi_note.htm#fn85"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> I have more: 
<bqverse 5>5  I was circumcised on the eighth day, from the people of Israel and the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews. I lived according to the law as a Pharisee.<a name="fnB86" href="phi_note.htm#fn86"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  In my zeal for God I persecuted the church. According to the righteousness stipulated in the law I was blameless. 
<bqverse 7>7  But these assets I have come to regard as liabilities because of Christ. 
<bqverse 8>8  More than that, I now regard all things as liabilities compared to the far greater value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things--indeed, I regard them as dung!<a name="fnB87" href="phi_note.htm#fn87"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a>--that I might gain Christ, 
<bqverse 9>9  and be found in him, not because of having my own righteousness derived from the law, but because of having the righteousness that comes by way of Christ's faithfulness<a name="fnB88" href="phi_note.htm#fn88"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a>--a righteousness from God that is in fact<a name="fnB89" href="phi_note.htm#fn89"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> based on Christ's<a name="fnB90" href="phi_note.htm#fn90"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> faithfulness.<a name="fnB91" href="phi_note.htm#fn91"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  My aim is to know him, to experience the power of his resurrection, to share in his sufferings,<a name="fnB92" href="phi_note.htm#fn92"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> and to be like him in his death, 
<bqverse 11>11  and so, somehow,<a name="fnB93" href="phi_note.htm#fn93"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> to attain to the resurrection from the dead.<a name="_Toc403221918"></a><a name="_Toc416894406"></a><a name="_Toc432265269"></a><a name="_Toc485060210"></a><a name="_Toc494013707"></a></p>
<p><i>Keep Going Forward</i>
<p>
<bqverse 12>12  Not that I have already attained this--that is, I have not already been perfected--but I strive to lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus also laid hold of me.<a name="fnB94" href="phi_note.htm#fn94"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13 Brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB95" href="phi_note.htm#fn95"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> I do not consider myself to have attained this. Instead I am single-minded:<a name="fnB96" href="phi_note.htm#fn96"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> forgetting the things that are behind and reaching out for the things that are ahead, 
<bqverse 14>14  with this goal in mind,<a name="fnB97" href="phi_note.htm#fn97"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> I strive toward the prize of the upward call of God<a name="fnB98" href="phi_note.htm#fn98"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> in Christ Jesus. 
<bqverse 15>15  Therefore let those of us who are "perfect" embrace this point of view.<a name="fnB99" href="phi_note.htm#fn99"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> If you think otherwise, God will reveal to you the error of your ways.<a name="fnB100" href="phi_note.htm#fn100"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  Nevertheless, let us live up to the standard that we have already attained.<a name="fnB101" href="phi_note.htm#fn101"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 17>17  Be imitators of me,<a name="fnB102" href="phi_note.htm#fn102"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB103" href="phi_note.htm#fn103"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> and watch carefully those who are living this way, just as you have us as an example. 
<bqverse 18>18  For many live (about whom I often told you, and now say even with tears) as enemies of the cross of Christ. 
<bqverse 19>19 Their end is destruction, their god is the belly, they exult in their shame, and they think about earthly things.<a name="fnB104" href="phi_note.htm#fn104"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  But our citizenship is in heaven--and we also await a savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, 
<bqverse 21>21  who will transform these humble bodies of ours<a name="fnB105" href="phi_note.htm#fn105"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> into the likeness of his glorious body by means of that power by which he is able to subject all things to himself.

<p><i>Christian Practices</i>
<p><A NAME="4"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> So then, my brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB106" href="phi_note.htm#fn106"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> dear friends whom I long to see, my joy and crown, stand in the Lord in this way, my dear friends!<p>

<bqverse 2>2  I appeal to Euodia and to Syntyche to agree in the Lord. 
<bqverse 3>3  Yes, I say also to you, true companion,<a name="fnB107" href="phi_note.htm#fn107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> help them. They have struggled together in the gospel ministry<a name="fnB108" href="phi_note.htm#fn108"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> along with me and Clement and my other coworkers, whose names are in the book of life. 
<bqverse 4>4  Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I say, rejoice! 
<bqverse 5>5  Let your gentleness be seen by all. The Lord is near! 
<bqverse 6>6  Do not be anxious about anything. Instead, tell your requests to God in your every prayer and petition--with thanksgiving. 
<bqverse 7>7  And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds<a name="fnB109" href="phi_note.htm#fn109"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> in Christ Jesus.<p>

<bqverse 8>8  Finally, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB110" href="phi_note.htm#fn110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> whatever is true, whatever is worthy of respect, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if something is excellent or praiseworthy, think about these things. 
<bqverse 9>9  And what you learned and received and heard and saw in me, do these things. And the God of peace will be with you.<a name="_Toc403221920"></a><a name="_Toc416894408"></a><a name="_Toc432265271"></a><a name="_Toc485060212"></a><a name="_Toc494013709"></a></p>
<p><i>Appreciation for Support</i>
<p>
<bqverse 10>10 I have great joy in the Lord because now at last you have again expressed your concern for me (now I know you were concerned before but had no opportunity to do anything).<a name="fnB111" href="phi_note.htm#fn111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content in any circumstance. 
<bqverse 12>12  I have experienced times of need and times of abundance. In any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of contentment,<a name="fnB112" href="phi_note.htm#fn112"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> whether I go satisfied or hungry, have plenty or nothing. 
<bqverse 13>13 I am able to do all things<a name="fnB113" href="phi_note.htm#fn113"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> through the one<a name="fnB114" href="phi_note.htm#fn114"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> who strengthens me.
<bqverse 14>14 Nevertheless, you did well to share with me in my trouble.<p>

<bqverse 15>15 And as you Philippians know, at the beginning of my gospel ministry, when I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in this matter of giving and receiving except you alone. 
<bqverse 16>16 For even in Thessalonica on more than one occasion<a name="fnB115" href="phi_note.htm#fn115"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> you sent something for my need. 
<bqverse 17>17 It is not that I am seeking a gift. Rather, I seek the credit that abounds to your account. 
<bqverse 18>18 For I have received all things, and I have plenty. I have all I need because I received from Epaphroditus your gifts--a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, very pleasing to God. 
<bqverse 19>19 And<b> </b>my God will supply all that you need according to the riches of his glory<a name="fnB116" href="phi_note.htm#fn116"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> in Christ Jesus. 
<bqverse 20>20 May glory be given to God our Father forever and ever. Amen.<a name="_Toc403221921"></a><a name="_Toc416894409"></a><a name="_Toc432265272"></a><a name="_Toc485060213"></a><a name="_Toc494013710"></a></p>
<p><i>Final Greetings</i>
<p>
<bqverse 21>21  Give greetings to all the saints in Christ Jesus. The brothers with me here send greetings.
<bqverse 22>22 All the saints greet you, especially those from Caesar's household.
<bqverse 23>23  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</p>
