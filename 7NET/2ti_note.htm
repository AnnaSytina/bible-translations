 <a name="fn48" href="2ti.htm#fnB48"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:11)  The following passage has been typeset as poetry because many scholars regard this passage as poetic or hymnic. These terms are used broadly to refer to the genre of writing, not to the content. There are two broad criteria for determining if a passage is poetic or hymnic: "(a) <i>stylistic:</i> a certain rhythmical lilt when the passages are read aloud, the presence of <i>parallelismus membrorum</i> (i.e., an arrangement into couplets), the semblance of some metre, and the presence of rhetorical devices such as alliteration, <i>chiasmus</i>, and antithesis; and (b) <i>linguistic: </i>an unusual vocabulary, particularly the presence of theological terms, which is different from the surrounding context" (P. T. O'Brien, <i>Philippians </i>[NIGTC], 188-9). Classifying a passage as hymnic or poetic is important because understanding this genre can provide keys to interpretation. However, not all scholars agree that the above criteria are present in this passage, so the decision to typeset it as poetry should be viewed as a tentative decision about its genre.<br>
 <a name="fn49" href="2ti.htm#fnB49"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:12)  <i>Grk</i> "died together...will live together...will reign together," without "him" stated explicitly. But "him" is implied by the parallel ideas in Rom 6:8; 8:17 and by the reference to Christ in vv. 12b-13.<br>
 <a name="fn50" href="2ti.htm#fnB50"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:12)  Or "renounce," "disown," "repudiate." It is important to note that the object of Christ's denial is "us." The text does not contain an implied object complement ("he will deny us [x]"), which would mean that Christ was withholding something from us (for example, "The owner denied his pets water"), since the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajrnevomai</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">arneomai</FONT>) is not one of the category of verbs that normally occurs in these constructions (see D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax</i>, 182-89). See also the note on the word "disown" in Luke 12:9. <br>
 <a name="fn51" href="2ti.htm#fnB51"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:12)  <i>Grk</i> "if we renounce," but the "him" is implied by the parallel clauses.<br>
 <a name="fn52" href="2ti.htm#fnB52"><sup>23</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:13)  <i>If we are unfaithful...he cannot deny himself. </i>This could be (1) a word of warning (The Lord will exact punishment; he cannot deny his holiness) or (2) a word of hope (Because of who he is, he remains faithful to us despite our lapses). The latter is more likely, since Paul consistently cites God's faithfulness as a reassurance, not as a warning (cf. especially Rom 3:3; also 1 Cor 1:9; 10:13; 2 Cor 1:18; 1 Thess 5:24; 2 Thess 3:3).<br>
 <a name="fn53" href="2ti.htm#fnB53"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:14)  <i>Grk</i> "remind of these things," implying "them" or "people" as the object.<br>
 <a name="fn54" href="2ti.htm#fnB54"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:14)  <i>Grk</i> "solemnly charging." The participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">diamarturovmeno"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">diamarturomeno"</FONT>) has been translated as a finite verb due to requirements of contemporary English style.<br>
 <a name="fn55" href="2ti.htm#fnB55"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:14)  <i>Grk</i> "[it is] beneficial for nothing, for the ruin of those who listen."<br>

 <a name="fn62" href="2ti.htm#fnB62"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tc</b> (2:18)  Most MSS have the article <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">thvn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">thn</FONT>) before <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajnavstasin</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">anastasin</FONT>), though significant witnesses of the Alexandrian and Western strain lack the article (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> F G 33<i> et pauci</i>). Since <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajnavstasin</FONT> is a third declension noun, an accidental oversight is not likely. As the accusative subject of the infinitive <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">gegonevnai</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">gegonenai</FONT>) in indirect discourse, the noun seems to require an article ("saying that <i>the</i> resurrection has already occurred"). Thus, there is strong scribal motivation for adding the article, and little for omitting it. The shorter reading thus is to be preferred. The basic sense of the translation is not changed either way.<br>

 <a name="fn71" href="2ti.htm#fnB71"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:24)  Traditionally, "servant" or "bondservant." Though <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dou'lo"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">doulos</FONT>) is normally translated "servant," the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BAGD notes that "`servant' for `slave' is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times...in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished" (BAGD 205 s.v.). The most accurate translation is "bondservant" (sometimes found in the ASV for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dou'lo"</FONT>), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:24)  Undoubtedly the background for the concept of being the Lord's slave or servant is to be found in the Old Testament scriptures. For a Jew this concept did not connote drudgery, but honor and privilege. It was used of national Israel at times (Isa 43:10), but was especially associated with famous OT personalities, including such great men as Moses (Joshua 14:7), David (Ps 89:3; cf. 2 Sam 7:5, 8) and Elijah (2 Kings 10:10); all these men were "servants (or slaves) of the Lord."<br>
 <a name="fn72" href="2ti.htm#fnB72"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:24)  <i>Grk</i> "must not fight" or "must not quarrel."<br>
 <a name="fn73" href="2ti.htm#fnB73"><sup>44</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:25)  <i>Correcting</i> is the word for "child-training" or "discipline." It is often positive (training, educating) but here denotes the negative side (correcting, disciplining).<br>
 <a name="fn74" href="2ti.htm#fnB74"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:25)  <i>Grk</i> "repentance unto knowledge of the truth."<br>

 <a name="fn76" href="2ti.htm#fnB76"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:26)  <i>Grk</i> "for that one's will," referring to the devil, but with a different pronoun than in the previous phrase "by him." Some have construed "for his will" with the earlier verb and referred the pronoun to God: "come to their senses and escape the devil's trap (though they have been captured by him) in order to do His will." In Classical Greek the shift in pronouns would suggest this, but in Koine Greek this change is not significant. The more natural sense is a reference to the devil's will.<br>
 <a name="fn77" href="2ti.htm#fnB77"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:1)  Or perhaps, "dangerous," "fierce."<br>
 <a name="fn78" href="2ti.htm#fnB78"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:2)  <i>Grk</i> "men"; but here <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">a[nqrwpoi</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">anqrwpoi</FONT>) is generic, referring to both men and women.<br>
 <a name="fn79" href="2ti.htm#fnB79"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:2)  Or "self-centered." The first two traits in 2 Tim 3:2 and the last two in 3:4 are Greek words beginning with the root "lovers of," and so bracket the list at beginning and end.<br>
 <a name="fn80" href="2ti.htm#fnB80"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:5)  Or "form."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:5)  <i>Outward appearance. </i>Paul's contrast with power in 3:5b shows that he regards this "form" to be outward, one of <i>appearance</i> rather than reality (cf. 1 Cor 4:19-20; 1 Thess 1:5).<br>

 <a name="fn98" href="2ti.htm#fnB98"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:16)  Or "All scripture."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:16)  There is very little difference in sense between <i>every scripture</i> (emphasizing the individual portions) and "all scripture" (emphasizing the composite whole). The former option is preferred, because it fits the normal use of the word "all/every" in Greek (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pa'"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">pas</FONT>) as well as Paul's normal sense for the word "scripture" in the singular without the article, as here. So <i>every scripture</i> means "every individual portion of scripture."<br>
 <a name="fn99" href="2ti.htm#fnB99"><sup>23</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:16)  <i>Inspired by God. </i>Some have connected this adjective in a different way and translated it as "every inspired scripture is also useful." But this violates the parallelism of the two adjectives in the sentence, and the arrangement of words makes clear that both should be taken as predicate adjectives: "<i>every scripture is inspired...and useful</i>." <br>
 <a name="fn100" href="2ti.htm#fnB100"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:16)  Or "rebuke," "censure." The Greek word implies exposing someone's sin in order to bring correction.<br>

 <a name="fn102" href="2ti.htm#fnB102"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:17)  This word is positioned for special emphasis; it carries the sense of "complete, competent, able to meet all demands."<br>

 <a name="fn110" href="2ti.htm#fnB110"><sup>8</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:4)  These <i>myths</i> were legendary tales characteristic of the false teachers in Ephesus and Crete. See parallels in 1 Tim 1:4; 4:7; and Titus 1:14.<br>

 <a name="fn113" href="2ti.htm#fnB113"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:7)  The expression <i>I have competed well</i> (<i>Grk </i>"I have competed the good competition") uses words that may refer to a race or to a boxing or wrestling match: "run the good race" or "fight the good fight." The similar phrase in 1:18 uses a military picture and is more literally "war the good warfare."<br>
 <a name="fn114" href="2ti.htm#fnB114"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:8)  <i>Grk</i> "all who have loved."<br>
 <a name="fn115" href="2ti.htm#fnB115"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tc</b> (4:10)  Most MSS have the aorist, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejgkatevlipen</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">enkatelipen</FONT>), though the evidence seems to be better for the imperfect <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejgkatevleipen</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">enkateleipen</FONT>; so A C D<sup>2 </sup>F G L P 33 81 1175 1881 <i>et alii</i>). At the same time, the reading of these witnesses could be a simple itacistic change. Intrinsically, it should be noted that Paul nowhere uses the imperfect of -<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">leivpw </FONT>(-<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">leipw</FONT>) verbs, though he does use the present participle on occasion. But a scribe would tend to change such forms to the aorist, to conform to Paul's style. As well, in this context the aorist fits nicely, while the imperfect seems a bit awkward (especially with its internal perspective). Hence, the imperfect has a slightly greater probability of being original. <br>
