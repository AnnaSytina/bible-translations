 <b>tn</b> (1:1)  The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l</FONT> in <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm)Ov=l! rv#a&amp;</FONT> has been taken as: (1) <i>authorship</i>: "which is written by Solomon." The <i>lamed</i> of authorship (aka <i>lamed auctoris</i>) is well attested in Hebrew (see GKC &#167;130.<i>b</i>), particularly in the psalms (e.g., Pss 18:1; 30:1; 34:1; 51:1; 52:1; 54:1; 56:1; 57:1; 59:1; 60:1; 63:1; 72:21); (2) <i>dedication</i>: "which is dedicated for Solomon." The <i>lamed</i> of dedication is attested in Ugaritic psalms dedicated to Baal or about Baal (<i>CTA</i> 6.1.1 = <i>UT</i> 49.1); or (3) <i>topic</i>: "which is about/concerning Solomon." The <i>lamed</i> of topic is attested in Hebrew (e.g., 1 Chr 24:20) and in Ugaritic, e.g., <i>lb&#180;l</i> "About Baal" (<i>CTA</i> 6.1.1 = <i>UT</i> 49.1). The <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l</FONT> is most likely denoting authorship. The <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l</FONT> followed by a name in the superscription of a poetic composition in the OT, usually (if not always) denotes authorship. Just as the superscription <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dw]d&#180;l=</FONT> claims Davidic authorship within the Psalter, so Solomon is claims Solomonic authorship. Whether or not this attribution is historically reliable or simply a matter of Jewish tradition is debated in scholarship, just as the Davidic superscriptions in the Psalter are debated (see study note on the word "Song" in the superscription).<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="sos.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:1) <i>Heb</i> "the song of songs." The genitive construct <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yr]yv!h^ ryv!</FONT> is translated literally as "the song of songs" in the early versions: Greek LXX (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">a/jsma a/jsmavtwn</FONT>), Latin Vulgate (<i>canticum canticorum</i>) and Syriac Peshitta (<FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">tesOEb&yuml;hat tesOEb&yuml;ha,,ta,,&aacute;</FONT>). The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yr]yv!h^ ryv!</FONT> may be understood in two ways: (1) The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yr]yv!h^</FONT> is a plural of number ("songs") and functions as a genitive of composition: "the song composed of several songs," that is, the book is a unified collection (hence the singular <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ryv!</FONT> "song") composed of individual love songs (see note on the expression "Her Lover" in v. 1). (2) The expression may be a superlative genitive construction denoting <i>par excellence</i> (see Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;9.5.3.j; GKC &#167;133.<i>i</i>; Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i> &#167;&#167;44, 80). For example, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yv!d&#180;q* vd\q)</FONT> ("the holy of holies") means the most holy place (Exod 29:37); <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yn]d)a&amp;h* yn}d)a&amp;w~ &lt;yh!Oa$h* yh@Oa$</FONT> ("the God of Gods and Lord of Lords") means the Highest God and the Supreme Lord (Deut 10:17); and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yd]b*u&amp; db#u#</FONT> ("a slave of slaves") means an abject slave (Gen 9:25). The title "the Song of Songs" is an expression of great esteem for the composition. Scholars suggest the title means "the most excellent song" (Fields), "the loveliest song" (Holladay 368), "the finest song" (Murphy 119) or "the sublime song" (Fox 96). It has been translated variously: "The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's" (KJV, NKJV, RSV, NRSV, NASB), "Solomon's Song of Songs" (NIV), "The most beautiful of songs, by Solomon" (TEV), "dedicated to," or "about Solomon" (TEV margin), "Solomon's most beautiful song" (CEV), "This is Solomon's song of songs, more wonderful than any other" (NLT).<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="sos.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:1) <i>Heb</i> "song." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ryv!</FONT> may refer to a musical song that was sung (Exod 15:1; Num 21:17; Ps 33:3; Isa 42:10) or a poetic composition that was simply read (Deut 31:19, 21, 22; 30; 32:44) (BDB 1010). Several factors suggest that the Song of Songs was poetry to be read and enjoyed rather than sung: (a) its sheer length, (b) absence of musical notations or instrumental instructions, (c) testimony of Jewish tradition and interpretation, (d) lack of evidence of its musical performance in the history of Israel, and (e) comparison with ancient Egyptian love poetry. The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ryv!</FONT> here probably refers to love poetry (e.g., Isa 5:1) (BDB 1010.1; Holladay 368). The Song appears to be a collection of individual love songs rather than a single multi-stanza poem. For comparison of the Song of Songs with ancient Egyptian loves songs, see M. V. Fox, <i>The Song of Songs and the Ancient Egyptian Love Songs</i> (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1985) and J. B. White, <i>A Study of the Language of Love in the Song of Songs and Ancient Egyptian Poetry,</i> SBLDS 38 (Missoula: Scholars Press, 1978).<br>
 <b>sn </b> (1:1) The superscription "Solomon's Most Excellent Love Song" appears to be a late addition, just as many superscriptions in the Psalter appear to have been added to the psalms sometime after their original composition. Murphy notes that the use of the independent relative pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rv#a&amp;</FONT> in 1:1 sharply distinguishes the superscription from the body of the Song as a whole where the short form -<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">v#</FONT> occurs thirty-two times (e.g., 1:6, 12; 6:5) (R. Murphy, <i>The Song of Songs</i>, Hermeneia [Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1990], 119). The short form -<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">v#</FONT> also occurs frequently in Ecclesiastes which is traditionally attributed to Solomon. Therefore, it would appear that the superscription is a later addition to the Song. This, of course, raises the question whether or not the attribution of Solomonic authorship of the Song is historically reliable or simply a matter of later Jewish tradition. For a full discussion of this issue, see W. W. Fields, "Solomon's Most Excellent Song: A Linguistic, Hermeneutical, Historical, and Philological Disquisition on the Hebrew Love Poetry of the Song of Solomon," unpublished Th.D. dissertation, Grace Theological Seminary (Winona Lake, Indiana: 1979), 9-125.<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="sos.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:1) The introductory headings that identify the speakers of the poems throughout the Song do not appear in the Hebrew text. They are supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity. These notations should not be misinterpreted as suggesting that the Song be interpreted as a drama. Throughout the Song, the notations "The Lover" refers to the young man, while "the Beloved" refers to the young woman. Since the Song of Songs appears to be a collection of individual love songs, the individual love poems within the collection might not have originally referred to the same young man and young woman in each case. Just as the Book of Proverbs contains proverbs composed by Solomon (10:1-22:16; 25:1-29:27) as well as proverbs composed by other wise men (22:17-24:34; 30:1-31:9), so the Song of Songs may contain love poems composed by Solomon or written about Solomon as well as love poems composed by or written about other young couples in love. Nevertheless, the final canonical form of this collection presents a unified picture of idyllic love between one man and one woman in each case. The young man in several of the individual love poems is explicitly identified as Solomon (1:5; 3:7; 8:11-12), King Solomon (3:9, 11) or the king (1:4; 7:6). Some statements in the Song are consistent with a royal figure such as Solomon: references to Tirzah and Jerusalem (6:4) and to multiple queens and concubines (6:8). It is not so clear, however, whether Solomon is the young man in every individual poem. Nor is it clear that the same young woman is in view in each love poem. In several poems the young woman is a country maiden working in a vineyard (1:5-6; 8:11-12); however, the young woman in another poem is addressed as "O prince's daughter" (7:2). The historian notes, "Solomon loved many women, especially the daughter of Pharaoh" (1 Kings 11:1). So it would be surprising if the Song devoted itself to only one of Solomon's many liaisons. The Song may simply be a collection of love poems written at various moments in Solomon's illustrious career as a lover of many women. It may also include love poems written about other young lovers that were collected into the final form of the book that presents a portrait of idyllic love of young lovers.<br>
 <a name="fn4" href="sos.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:2) <i>Heb</i> "May he kiss me...." The shift from 3ms forms ("he" and "his") in 1:2a to 2ms forms ("your") in 1:2b-4 has led some commentators to suggest that the Beloved addresses the Friends in 1:2a and then her Lover in 1:2b-4.  A better solution is that the shift from the 3ms to 2ms forms is an example of heterosis of person: a common poetic device in which the grammatical person shifts from line to line. The third person is put for the second person (e.g, Gen 49:4; Deut 32:15; Ps 23:2-5; Isa 1:29; 42:20; 54:1; Jer 22:24; Amos 4:1; Micah 7:19; Lam 3:1; Song 4:2; 6:6). Similar shifts occur in ancient Near Eastern love literature. Most translations render 1:2 literally and preserve the shifts from 3ms to 2ms forms (KJV, AV, NASB, NIV); others render 1:2 with 2ms forms throughout (RSV, NJPS).

 <a name="fn6" href="sos.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:2)  The MT vocalizes consonantal <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">iydd</FONT> as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;yd\D)</FONT> "your loves" (mpl noun from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">doD</FONT> "love" + 2ms suffix). The LXX and Vulgate reflect the vocalization <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;yD\D^</FONT> "your breasts" (mpl noun from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dD^</FONT> "breast" + 2ms suffix). This alternate tradition was well known; it was followed by Hippolytus of Rome (d. 235) in his exposition of Canticles 1:2 and by Rabbi Yohanan of Tiberias (3rd century A.D.) as recorded in the Jewish midrashim on Canticles Rabbah 1:2.2. However, the MT vocalization is preferred. In terms of external evidence, the MT vocalization tradition is generally more reliable. In terms of internal evidence, the LXX form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;yD\D^</FONT> "your (male!) breasts" is a bit shocking, to say the least. On the other, the plural form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yd]oD</FONT> ("loves") is used in the Song to refer to multiple expressions of love or multiple acts of lovemaking (e.g., 1:4; 4:10; 5:1; 7:13 [ET 12]). <br>
 <b>tn </b> (1:3) Although it is may be understood in the general sense meaning "love" (Song 1:4), the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">doD</FONT> normally means "lovemaking" (Prov 7:18; Song 4:10; 7:12<sup>13</sup>; Ezek 16:8; 23:17). The plural form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;yd\D)</FONT> (lit. "your lovemakings") is probably not a plural of number but an abstract plural (so BDB 187.3).  <br>
 <a name="fn7" href="sos.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:2) <i>Heb</i> "better than." With the comparison of lovemaking to wine, the idea is probably "more intoxicating than wine" or "more delightful than wine."<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="sos.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:2) The young woman compares his lovemaking to the intoxicating effects of wine. A man is to be "intoxicated" with the love of his wife (Prov 5:20). Wine makes the heart glad (Deut 14:26; Judg 9:13; Ps 104:15) and revives the spirit (2 Sam 16:1-2; Prov 31:4-7). It is viewed as a gift from God, given to enable man to enjoy life (Eccl 2:24-25; 5:18). The ancient Egyptian love poems use the imagery of wine and intoxication to describe the overwhelming effects of sexual love. For example, an ancient Egyptian love song reads: "I embrace her and her arms open wide; I am like a man in Punt, like someone overwhelmed with drugs. I kiss her and her lips open; and I am drunk without beer" (<i>ANET</i> 467-69).<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="sos.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:3) The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l</FONT> of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">j~yr}l=</FONT> has been understood in three ways: (a) dative of reference: "with respect to fragrance [your perfumes are pleasing]" (see GKC &#167;133.<i>d</i>); (b) asseverative or emphatic: "indeed the fragrance [of your perfumes is pleasing]" (see Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i> &#167;283); or (c) comparative: "[your lovemaking is better than wine], indeed better the scent [of precious ointments]" (W. F. Albright "Archaic Survivals in the Text of Canticles," in <i>Hebrew and Semitic Studies Presented to Godfrey Rolles Driver</i>, ed. D. W. Thomas and W. D. McHardy (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1963), p. 2 n. 4.<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="sos.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:3) <i>Heb</i> "the scent of your oils." The term "cologne" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m#v#</FONT>) refers to perfumes or colognes (Eccl 7:1; 10:1; Song 4:10). In Israel bodily oils were expensive (1 Kgs 17:12ff; 2 Kgs 2:4ff). Possession of oils and perfumes was a sign of prosperity and luxury (Deut 32:8; 33:24; Job 29:6; Prov 21:17; Ezek 16:13, 20). Wearing colognes and oils was associated with joy (Ps 45:8; Eccl 9:8; Isa 61:3) because they were worn on festive occasions (Prov 27:9).<br>
 <a name="fn11" href="sos.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>sn </b> (1:3) The term "pleasing" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yb!of</FONT>) refers to what is pleasant to the olfactory senses (BDB 373 1.c) (e.g., Jer 6:20).<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="sos.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn </b> (1:3) The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;m#v= </FONT>("your name") may be a metonymy of association for Solomon himself. In Hebrew idiom, the name often represents the person (e.g., 1 Sam 25:25). Thus, "your very self" (AV), "thy presence" (Gordis), and "thou art oil" (Jastrow). Ginsburg renders the verse, "Sweet is the odour of thy perfumes, because thou art that perfume, by thy name diffused abroad."<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="sos.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:3) The meaning of the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qr~WT /m#v#</FONT> is difficult to determine; several options have been proposed: (1) Traditionally, the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qr~WT</FONT> is taken as a verb (Hophal imperfect 3fs from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qyr]</FONT> "to pour out") which functions as an attributive adjective modifying the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m#v#</FONT> ("oil, perfume"): "poured out oil." The phrase is taken this way by LXX <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">e]laion ejkkenwqeVn</FONT> ("oil poured out") which seems to reflect a Hebrew <i>Vorlage</i> of a passive verb functioning adjectivally. Accordingly, the phrase is traditionally translated "ointment/oil poured forth/poured out" (KJV, NKJV, ASV, NIV, RSV, NRSV, NJB), "purified oil" (NASB) or "spreading perfume" (NAB, CEV). However, this is syntactically awkward because: (a) the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m#v#</FONT> ("oil") is masculine (BDB 1032) but the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qr~WT</FONT> ("poured out") is feminine (3fs); and (b) this would demand heterosis of the verb for an adjective function. (2) Aquila, who is known for his woodenly literal translation technique, reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">e]laion ejkceomenon</FONT> ("oil poured out") which reflects a passive participle functioning adjectivally, perhaps <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qr&#180;Wm</FONT> (Hophal participle ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qyr]</FONT> "to pour out"). This involves simple orthographic confusion between <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">t</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">m</FONT>. This might be reflected in Qumran because Baillet's restoration of 6QCant reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hqrwm tjqrm</FONT> (cited in <i>BHS</i> apparatus "c-c") which would be vocalized <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hq*rWm tj^q^r+m!</FONT> "perfumed poured out." However, Baillet's restoration is questioned by some scholars. (3) The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest emending MT <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qr~WT</FONT> to the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qWrm=T^</FONT> ("purification"), used for oil of purification (e.g., Esth 2:3, 9, 12): <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qWrm=T^</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m#v#</FONT> would mean "oil of purification" or "purified oil." (4) A simpler solution is to take <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qr^WT</FONT> as a previously unrecognized noun that is related to the Ugaritic noun <i>trq</i> which refers to high grade cosmetic oil (<i>UT</i> 145.20; 19.371). This approach is adopted by one other translation: "Your name is like finest oil" (NJPS).<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="sos.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>sn </b> (1:3) The similar sounding terms "name" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v@</FONT>) and "perfume" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m#v#</FONT>) creates a wordplay (paronomasia).

 <a name="fn15" href="sos.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>sn </b> (1:3) The term "maiden" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*l=u^</FONT>) refers to a young woman who is sexually mature, that is, a young woman who is of marriageable age or a newly married young woman, usually before the birth of her first child (<i>HALOT</i> 835-36; BDB 761c) (e.g., Gen 24:43; Exod 2:8; Ps 68:26; Prov 30:19; Song 1:3; 6:8; Isa 7:14). The only other use of the term "maidens" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toml*u&amp;</FONT>) in the Song refers to the young women of Solomon's harem (Song 6:8). The root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;lu</FONT> III denotes the basic idea of "youthful, strong, passionate" (<i>HALOT</i> 835) or "sexually ripe, vigorous" (BDB 761). While the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*l=u^</FONT> ("maiden") may be used in reference to a young woman who is a virgin, the term itself does not explicitly denote "virgin." The Hebrew term which explicitly denotes "virgin" is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hl*WtB=</FONT> which refers to a mature young woman without any sexual experience with men (e.g., Gen 24:16; Exod 22:15-16; Lev 21:3; Deut 22:23, 28; 32:25; Judg 12:12; 19:24; 2 Sam 13:2, 18; 1 Kgs 1:2; 2 Chr 36:17; Esth 2:2-3, 17, 19; Job 31:1; Pss 45:15; 78:63; 148:12; Isa 23:4; 62:5; Jer 2:32; 31:3; 51:22; Lam 1:4, 18; 2:10, 21; 5:11; Ezek 9:6; Joel 1:8; Amos 9:13; Zech 9:17 (<i>HALOT </i>167; BDB 143d).

Elsewhere it is used figuratively of a master lovingly leading an animal with leather cords (Hos 11:4) and of a military victor leading his captives (Jer 31:3). The point of comparison might be that the woman wants to be the willing captive of the love of her beloved, that is, a willing prisoner of his love.<br>
 <a name="fn18" href="sos.htm#fnB18"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:4) The three verbs in this line are a good example of heterosis of person, that is, a shift from 2ms to 1cpl to 3ms forms: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn]k@v=m*</FONT> "draw me!"

The article on the noun "king"(<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">El#M#h^</FONT>) may be taken in two ways: (1) the particularizing use of the article: "The king" (e.g., NIV: "The king has brought me into his chambers") or (2) the vocative use of the article: "O king!"

The syntactical classification of the article is dependent upon: (1) Whether the MT reading of the 3ms suffix on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wyr&#180;d&#180;j&amp; </FONT>("his chambers") is retained or whether the text is emended to the 2ms suffix form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;r\d=h^</FONT> ("your chamber") as reflected in Syriac (see textual note below).

 <a name="fn20" href="sos.htm#fnB20"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:4) Or "has brought me." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn]a^yb!h$</FONT> (Hiphil perfect 3ms <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aoB </FONT>"to bring" + 1cs suffix) may be classified in two ways: (1) perfect of past action: "The king <i>has brought me</i> into his chambers" or (2) precative perfect: "May the king <i>bring me</i> into his chambers!" (J. S. Deere, <i>BKCOT</i>, 1012). While some older grammarians denied the existence of the precative (volitional) function of the perfect in Hebrew (e.g., S. R. Driver, <i>Tenses in Hebrew</i>, 25-26; GKC &#167;106.<i>n</i> note 2), its existence has been well championed (e.g., M. Buttenwieser, <i>The Psalms: Chronologically Treated with a New Translation</i> [Chicago: University of Chicago, 1938], 18-25) and it is accepted in more recent grammars (e.g., Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 30.5.4d; Jo&uuml;on-Muraoka, <i>Grammar</i>, &#167;112.k). While the perfect of past action is the more common use of the perfect, the context suggests the more rare precative. As Waltke notes, the precative can be recognized contextually by its parallelism with the other volitive forms (Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 30.5.4d). The parallelism of precative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn]a^yb!h$ </FONT>("bring me!") with the volitives in the two preceding parallel colons-- <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn]k@v=m*</FONT> "draw me!" (Qal imperative 3ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ev^m*</FONT> "to draw" + 1cs suffix:) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hx*WrN&#180; </FONT>"let us run!" (Qal cohortative 1cpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">JWr</FONT> "to run") --favors the precative function of the perfect. The volitive function of consonantal <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ynaybh</FONT> is reflected in Syriac. The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest revocalizing MT to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn]a@yb!h&amp;</FONT> "bring me!" (Hiphil imperative 2ms + 1cs suffix). The precative function of the perfect <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn]a^yb!h$</FONT> may explain the origin of this variant vocalization tradition reflected in Syriac. In terms of connotation, the precative functions as a volitive as an example of the irreal modal or optative function of the perfect (Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 30.5.4d; Jo&uuml;on-Muraoka, <i>Grammar</i>, &#167;112.k). In contrast to the use of the irreal perfect for situations which the speaker expresses as a wish without expectation of fulfillment (contrary-to-fact situations, hypothetical assertions, and expressions of a wish that is not expected to be realized), the precative refers to situations the speaker expresses his desire for and expects to be realized (Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 30.5.4d). It is used most often in contexts of prayers to God which the speakers expect to be answered (e.g., Pss 3:8; 22:22; 31:5-6). Here, she expresses her desire that her lover consummate their love in his bedroom chambers; she expects this desire to be realized one day (e.g., 4:1-5:1). There are, however, several problems with nuancing the form as a precative: (a) this would demand emending MT <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wyr&#180;d&#180;j&amp;</FONT> ("his chambers") to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;r\d=j^</FONT> ("your chamber[s]") --which is, however, reflected by Syriac Peshitta and Symmachus, and (b) it would demand nuancing the article on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">El#M#h^</FONT> as a vocative ("O king!").<br>

It refers explicitly to a bedroom when used with the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bK*v=m!</FONT> ("bed") in the expression <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bK*v=m! rd\j#</FONT> "bedroom chamber" (Exod 7:28; 2 Sam 4:7; 2 Kgs 6:12; Eccl 10:20). The plural form "his chamber<i>s</i>" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wyr&#180;d&#180;j&amp;</FONT>) functions as a plural of extension rather than a plural or number; it refers to one bedroom composed of several parts rather than referring to several different bedrooms. The expression "Bring me into your chambers" is a metonymy of cause for effect, that is, her desire for lovemaking in his bedroom chambers.<br>
 <a name="fn23" href="sos.htm#fnB23"><sup>24</sup></a><b>sn </b> (1:4) Normally in the Song, the person/gender of the pronouns and suffixes makes the identify of the speaker or addressee clear. However, there are several places in which there is grammatical ambiguity that makes it difficult to identify either the speaker or the addressee (e.g., 6:11-13; 7:9b). This is particularly true when 1cpl or 3cpl verbs or suffixes are present (1:3[4]; 2:15; 5:1b; 8:8-9), as is the case in the three lines of 1:3b[4b]. There are four views to the identity of the speaker(s): (1) NASB attributes all three lines to the maidens, (2) NIV attributes the first two lines to the friends and the third line to the Beloved (= woman), (3) NJPS attributes all three lines to the Beloved, speaking throughout 1:2-4, and (4) The first line could be attributed to Solomon speaking to his beloved, and the last two lines attributed to the Beloved who returns praise to him. The referents of the 1cpl cohortatives and the 2sg suffixes have been taken as: (1) the maidens of Jerusalem, mentioned in 1:4[5] and possibly referred to as the 3cpl subject of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;Wbh@a&amp;</FONT> ("they love you") in 1:3b[4b], using the 1cpl cohortatives in reference to themselves as they address Solomon: "We (= maidens) will rejoice in you (= Solomon). (2) The Beloved using 1cpl cohortatives in a hortatory sense as she addresses Solomon: "Let us (= Solomon and the Beloved) rejoice in you (= Solomon), let us praise your lovemaking ..." (3) The Beloved using the 1cpl cohortatives in reference to herself--there are examples in ancient Near Eastern love literature of the bride using 1cpl forms in reference to herself (S.N. Kramer, <i>The Sacred Marriage Rite</i>, 92, 99) --as she addresses Solomon: "We (= I) will rejoice in you (= Solomon)." Note: This problem is compounded by the ambiguity of the gender on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">EB*</FONT> ("in you") which appears to be 2fs but may be 2ms in pause (see note below).<br>

 <a name="fn25" href="sos.htm#fnB25"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn </b> (1:4) Some commentators suggest that Solomon is addressing his Beloved because <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">EB* </FONT>appears to have a 2fs suffix.

Several translations and many commentators end the words of the Beloved at 1:4a and begin the words of the Friends in 1:4b and revert back to the words of the Beloved in 1:4c. The subject of the 1cpl forms may be the "maidens" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toml*u&amp;</FONT>) previously mentioned in 1:3. This is supported by the fact that in 1:3 the Beloved says, "The maidens love you" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;Wbh@a&amp; toml*u&amp;</FONT>) and in 1:4c she again says, "Rightly do they [the maidens] love you" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;Wbh@a&amp; &lt;yr]v*ym@</FONT>).

The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rk^z*</FONT> has a wide range of meanings: "to remember, call to mind" (Gen 8:1; Deut 24:9; Judg 8:34), "to name, mention" (Jer 20:9; 23:36; 31:20; Pss 63:7; 77:4), "to summon, command" (Nah 2:6), "to swear by" (Amos 6:10; 1 Chr 16:4), and "to praise, extol" (Exod 23:13; Josh 23:7; Pss 45:18; 71:16; Isa 26:13; 48:1; 62:6). The Hiphil stem has four denotations, and "to remember" is not one of them: (1) "to take to court," (2) "to mention," (3) "to make known," and (4) "to praise, profess" (<i>HALOT </i>270).

The LXX's <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eujquvth" hjgavphsen se </FONT>("righteousness loves you") is awkward. The adverbial sense is preferred for several reasons: (1) The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;Wbh@a&amp;</FONT> ("they love you") in 1:4c is repeated from 1:3c where it was used in reference to the maiden's love for Solomon. (2) There is no group designated as "the righteous" elsewhere in the Song. (3) To introduce an additional party into this poetic unit is unnecessary when it can be easily understood as a reference to the maidens of 1:3c.<br>

However, the shift in person might simply be another example of heterosis of person (as already seen in 1:2-4a) --this time from first person to third person. Thus, the shift in grammatical person does not necessarily indicate a shift in speakers. It is possible that the maidens are speaking throughout all three lines, and that the third line should be nuanced, "How rightly we love you!"<br>

The poetic structure of this tricolon is classified as an example of redistribution. The terms "black but beautiful" in the A-line are broken up--the B-line picks up on "black" and the C-line picks up on "beautiful" (Rashi, Lowth, Kugel, Watson). The Beloved was "black" like the rugged tents of Qedar woven from the wool of black goats, but "beautiful" as the decorative inner tent-curtains of King Solomon. Selected Bibliography: R.

 <a name="fn31" href="sos.htm#fnB31"><sup>32</sup></a><b>sn </b> (1:5) The comparison of her dark, outdoors appearance to the "tents of Qedar" is quite fitting for two reasons. First, the name "Qedar" refers to an ancient Arabian tribe of bedouin who lived in tents and inhabited a region in northern Arabia. Their tents were traditionally woven from the wool of black goats. They were not beautiful to look at; they were rough, rustic, rugged, and weather-beaten. Second, the terms "black" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hr&#180;ojv=</FONT>) and "Qedar" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rd&#180;q@</FONT>) create a wordplay because the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rd^q*</FONT> means "dark, dirty" (<i>HALOT </i>1072).  The point of the comparison is that the Beloved had dark skin and a rugged outdoors appearance because she had been forced to work outdoors, and so her skin had become dark as 1:6 states.

The term "tent" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lh#a)</FONT>) is often used in reference to an overall tent assembly, with particular emphasis on the external structure (e.g., Gen 4:20; 18:1; 31:33; Exod 26:13; 40:19; Judg 4:17; Isa 54:2; Jer 37:10) (<i>HALOT </i>19). The term "tent-curtains" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">houyr]y+</FONT>) is used to refer to (1) inner hanging curtains, such as decorative hangings or tapestries inside a tent (e.g., Exod 26:1-2, 7; Num 4:25) and (2) a tent as a whole (e.g., 2 Sam 7:2; Jer 4:20; 10:20; Hab 3:7) (<i>HALOT </i>439). The two terms are often used in parallelism as an A-B word pair (Isa 54:2; Jer 4:20; 10:20; 49:29; Hab 3:7). Like the "tents" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yl!h*a)</FONT>) of Qedar which were made from the wool of black goats, "tent-curtains" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">houyr]y+</FONT>) also were sometimes made from goat hair (Exod 26:7). If the two are synonymous, the point is that the tents of Qedar and the tent-curtains of Solomon were both black but beautiful. If the two terms are antonyms, the point is that the tents of Qedar are black but the tent-curtains of Solomon are beautiful. In either case, her point is that she is black, but nonetheless beautiful. Rabbinic midrash misses the point; it views the metaphor as contrasting her swarthy outward appearance with her inner beauty: "Just as the tents of Kedar, although from outside they look ugly, black, and ragged, yet inside contain precious stones and pearls, so the disciples of the wise, although they look repulsive and swarthy in this world, yet have within them knowledge of the Torah, Scriptures, Mishnah, Midrash, Halachoth, Talmud, Toseftas and Haggadah" (Midrash Rabbah).

Like the tribe of Qedar, Salmah was an Arabian nomadic tribe which inhabited a region in northern Arabia and the region of Petra.

The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hf*u* </FONT>describes a person wrapping oneself in a garment or with a veil (<i>HALOT </i>813) as (a) a sign of grief or mourning (Ezek 24:17, 22), uncleanness (Lev 13:45), or shame (Mic 3:7), and as (b) the clothing of the deceased (1 Sam 28:14) and veiled cult-prostitutes (Gen 28:14). The term is rendered "one who veils herself" (NASB), "one who is veiled" (NRSV, KJV margin) and "like a veiled woman" (ASV, NIV). BDB suggests that she veiled herself in mourning (BDB 742). Rashi suggested that she veiled herself in mourning because she did not know where to find her beloved (Canticles Rabbah 1.6). Many commentators (M. Pope, G. L. Carr, J. S. Deere, S. M. Lehrmann) connect this with the veiled cult-prostitute soliciting business among shepherds. She wished to avoid what Tamar tried to do: to be mistaken as a harlot looking for business among the shepherds (Gen 38:14-23). If her beloved would not declare his whereabouts, she would be reduced to looking for him among the shepherds - an action that could be easily misunderstood. This is reflected in the CEV paraphrase: "Don't let the other shepherds think badly of me." Murphy writes: "Commentators have interpreted the covering as a sign of mourning (2 Sam 15:30) or as the sign of a harlot (Gen 38:14-15). These references are not helpful in explaining the context of v 7, and in neither of the instances is the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hf*u*</FONT> used. She seems rather to refer to some kind of covering or disguise she will be forced to use unless she knows where to find him. One can infer that the disguise will enable her to avoid being identified by his `companions,' but no reason is given (perhaps she does not want them to know about the rendezvous?)" (Murphy, <i>Song of Songs</i>, 131). (2) Other scholars resort to comparative lexicography. For example, Driver suggested that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hy&#180;f=u)</FONT> is not derived from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hf*u*</FONT> I ("to veil"), but from the Arabic root <i>gth</i> that came into Hebrew as the homonymic root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hf*u*</FONT> II "to pick lice" (Isa 22:17; Jer 43:12) (BDB 742). Driver renders the line, "lest I be left picking lice," that is, while away the siesta-time grooming herself. Most scholars reject this proposal; it seems strange in the context and unnecessarily creates a homonym for a well-known term that makes adequate sense contextually. Nevertheless, Driver's proposal was adopted by the NEB: "that I may not be left picking lice." Selected Bibliography: G. R. Driver, "Lice in the Old Testament," <i>PEQ</i> 106 (1974): 159-160.

However, several ancient versions (Greek: Symmachus, Syriac Peshitta, Vulgate) reflect a Hebrew <i>Vorlage</i> with metathesis of the first two consonants: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hY&#180;u!f)K=</FONT> from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hu*f*</FONT> "to wander about, to stray" (e.g., Ezek 13:10). The root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hu*f*</FONT> would be an Aramaizing form of Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hu*T*</FONT> ("to wander"). This emendation is suggested by the <i>BHS</i> editors and the lexicons (<i>HALOT </i>377; 814; BDB 742); it is adopted by several commentators (Gordis, Robert) and many translations: "like one who wanders" (RSV, AV, JB, NAB, NJV), "like one who strays" (JPS, NJPS) and "as one that turneth aside" (KJV). This would make nice sense contextually: she begs her beloved to tell her where to find him because she does not want to wander around like someone who is lost. <br>

Pope offers the best explanation of this enigmatic picture: "A crucial consideration overlooked by commentators is the well-attested fact that Pharaoh's chariots, like other chariotry in antiquity, were not drawn by a mare or mares but by stallions hitched in pairs. This bit of intelligence radically alters the usual understanding of the verse and dispels the notion that there is a grammatical incongruity, which needs harmonizing. The juxtaposition is between a single mare and a plurality of stallions and it requires only a modicum of what is called `horse sense' to appreciate the thrust of the comparison. The situation envisaged is illustrated by the famous incident in one of the campaigns of Thutmose III against Qadesh. On his tomb at Thebes, the Egyptian soldier Amenemheb relates how the Prince of Qadesh sent forth a swift mare, which entered among the army. But Amenemheb ran after her on foot and with his dagger ripped open her belly, cut off her tail, and presented it to the king, thus preventing a debacle before the excited stallions could take out after the mare" (M.

(5) Goulder suggests that the comparison has to do with the fluttering of her eyes which reminded Solomon of the fluttering of a dove's wings.

Early English translators knew that it referred to some kind of flower but were unsure exactly which kind of flower, so they arbitrarily chose "rose" because it was a well-known and beautiful flower.

The Hebrew term is related to Syriac <i>hamsalaita</i> ("meadow saffron") and Akkadian <i>habasillatu</i> ("flower-stalk, marsh plant, reed"). Lexicographers and botanists suggest that the Hebrew term refers to <i>Ashodelos</i> (lily family), <i>Narcissus tazetta</i> (narcissus or daffodil), or <i>Colchicum autumnale</i> (meadow-saffron or crocus).

Reubeni further suggests that Jesus's statement about the lilies of the field was not describing an especially beautiful or conspicuous flower, but rather a small and insignificant one whose beauty would be missed by all but the most observant and appreciative (Matt 6:28; Luke 12:27).

Like a cultivated apple tree, the Lover was unique and stood out among all other men. In ancient Near Eastern love literature, the apple tree was a common symbol for romantic love and sexual fertility. The "apple tree" motif is used in the Song in a similar manner (e.g., Song 2:3; 8:5). Likewise, the motif of "apples" is used as a symbol of fertility (Joel 1:12) and sexual desire (Song 2:5, 7, 9).

The related noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hD&#180;m=j#</FONT> describes objects which are "delightful, precious, desirable" (<i>HALOT </i>325).

This term is used in OT literally (physical shade from the sun) and figuratively (protection from something) (<i>HALOT </i>1024-25): (1) Literal: The physical shade of a tree offers protection from the heat of the midday sun (Judg 9:15; Ezek 17:23; 31:6, 12, 17; Hos 4:13; Jon 4:6; Job 7:22; 40:22). Similar protection from the sun is offered by the shade of a vine (Ps 80:11), root (Gen 19:8), mountain (Judg 9:36), rock (Isa 32:2), cloud (Isa 25:5), and hut (Jon 4:5). (2) Figurative (hypocatastasis): Just as physical shade offers protection from the sun, the Israelite could find "shade" (protection) from God or the king (e.g., Num 14:9; Isa 30:2; 49:2; 51:16; Hos 14:8; Pss 17:8; 36:8; 57:2; 63:8; 91:1; 121:5; Lam 4:20; Eccl 7:12). The association between "shade" and "protection" is seen in the related Akkadian <i>sillu</i> "shade, covering, protection" (<i>AHw</i> 1101; CAD S:189). The epithets of several Akkadian deities are <i>sillu</i> and <i>sululu</i> ("Shade, Protector"). Selected Bibliography: K. L. Tallqvist, <i>Akkadische Gotter-Epitheta</i> (Helsinki, 1974), 159; J. J. Stamm, <i>Die akkadische Namengebung</i> (Darmstadt, 1968), 211. The motif of protection, rest, and relief from the sun seems to be implied by the expression "I sat down" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yT!b=v^y&#180;w+</FONT>) in 2:3b. During the summer months, the temperature often reaches 110-130 &#186;F in the Negev. Those who have never personally experienced the heat of the summer sun in the Negev as they performed strenuous physical labor cannot fully appreciate the relief offered by any kind of shade! Previously, the young woman had complained that she had been burned by the sun because she had been forced to labor in the vineyards with no shade to protect her (Song 1:5-6). She had urged Solomon to tell her where she could find relief from the sun during the hot midday hours (Song 1:7). Now she exults that she finally had found relief from the scorching sun under the "shade" which Solomon offered to her (Song 2:3). Glickman writes: "Whereas before she came to him she worked long hours on the sun (1:6), now she rests under the protective shade he brings. And although formerly she was so exhausted by her work she could not properly care for herself, now she finds time for refreshment with him" (S. C. Glickman, <i>A Song for Lovers</i> [Downers Grove: InterVarsity, 1976], 40).<br>

Dillow, on the other hand, suggests a much more erotic interpretation: his "fruit" is a euphemism for male genitals and the young woman is performing oral sex (J. Dillow, <i>Solomon on Sex</i>, 31). Although the Song features romantic and sexual imagery, this seems extreme. The term "fruit" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yr]P=</FONT>) is used figuratively 119 times in the Old Testament and not once is it used as a sexual euphemism. Nowhere else in the Song is oral sex suggested, nor is oral sex ever mentioned in the ancient Egyptian love literature. It is more reasonable to take the imagery of the young woman tasting his "fruit" as referring to simple kissing. Likewise, the imagery of the gazelles grazing among the lilies is probably a picture of the young man caressing and kissing his beloved (Song 2:16; 6:3).<br>

When used literally, it describes pleasant tasting foods, such as honey (Judg 14:14, 18; Prov 24:13; Ps 19:11) or sweet water (Num 33:28; Prov 9:17). Used figuratively, it describes what is pleasant to experience: friendship (Job 20:12; Ps 55:15; Prov 27:9), life (Eccl 11:7; Sir 40:18), sleep for the weary (Eccl 5:11), eloquence in speech (Prov 16:21, 24), and scripture (Ps 19:11). Those who adopt the "hyper-erotic" approach opt for the literal meaning: Solomon's "fruit" tastes sweet to her palate. The non-erotic approach takes the term in its figurative sense: The experience of Solomon's love was pleasant.<br>
 <a name="fn81" href="sos.htm#fnB81"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:3) <i>Heb</i> "my palate." The term "my palate" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!j!</FONT>) is used metonymically in reference to the sensation of taste which is associated with a person's palate. The idea of "tasting" is used as a metaphor in the OT for the experiential knowledge which is acquired through a person's relationship with someone (e.g., Ps. 34:9). Just as a person would learn whether a fruit was ripe and delicious by tasting it, so a person could learn of the quality of a person's character by experiencing it through personal interaction. This extended metaphor compares the delights of Solomon's love to (1) the refreshment of sitting in the shade of a tree for refuge from the desert sun, and (2) the delight of tasting a sweet apple--a fruit that was not indigenous to Palestine. This extended metaphor has been interpreted in an erotic sense by Dillow who suggests that this metaphor depicts oral sex: the "apple tree" is a symbol for the body of her Lover; her "sitting under the shade" of the apple tree is a symbol for the Beloved kneeling down before her Lover to engage in oral sex; the "fruit" of the apple tree is a symbol for the male genitals; "tasting" the fruit is a symbol for oral copulation. Admittedly, the Song does contain sexual imagery, but it is questionable whether this kind of hyper-erotic treatment is warranted. The most appropriate way to interpret any extended metaphor is to determine the commonplace association of the figures, that is, how are the figures ("apple tree," "shade," "fruit," and "taste") commonly used and with what are they typically associated?

It would feature four parallel imperatives of request, all revolving around the theme of love-sickness: "Bring me into the banquet hall, feed me with love; sustain me with raisin cakes, refresh me with apples, because I am faint with love." The weakness with the revocalization to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn]a%yb!h&amp;</FONT> ("Bring me!") is that it demands, due to the dictates of synonymous parallelism, the questionable revocalization of the MT's <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">olg=d]w+ </FONT>("and his banner") to the imperative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wlg=d]w+</FONT> ("and feed [me]").<br>

 <b>tn </b> (2:4) The meaning of the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">olg=D!</FONT> is debated. Five basic views have emerged: (1) "his banner over me was love." BDB relates <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">olg=D!</FONT> to the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lg#D=</FONT> I "standard, banner" (BDB 186) which refers to (a) banners, standards (Num 1:52; 2:2) and (b) battalion, company of troops, or division of a tribe signaled by a banner or standard (Num 2:3, 10, 17-18, 25, 31, 34; 10:14, 18, 22, 25). Thus, most translations render <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">olg=D!</FONT> as "his banner" (KJV, NASB, NIV, NJPS). However, the expression "His banner over me was love" is enigmatic. (2) "serve love to me!" Delitzsch revocalized the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">olg=d!w+ </FONT>("his banner") as an imperative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wlg=d!w+</FONT> ("serve [me]") from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lg^D*</FONT> III ("to serve food") which is related to Akkadian <i>dagalu</i> II ("to serve food").  Delitzsch renders the passage: "Bring me into the banquet hall and serve me love...for I am faint with love." This is supported by LXX which reads: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eijsagavgetev me eij" oi\kon tou' oi]nou, tavxate ejp' ejmeV ajgavphn</FONT> ("Bring me into the wine house, and set love before me"). However, Gordis points out the difficulties with Delitzsch's proposal: (a) the meaning "serve" for <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lg^D*</FONT> is unparalleled in Hebrew thus, it would create a homonymic <i>hapax legomenon</i>; (b) We would expect the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yl!</FONT> ("to me") rather than <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yl^u*</FONT> ("over me") after the imperative; and (c) The Akkadian parallel is uncertain. (3) "its banner above me is love." HALOT relates<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> olg=D!</FONT> to the Akkadian noun <i>diglu</i> ("eyesight, view, look, gaze") and proposes the nuance "sign of an inn," such as a flag placed over taverns (<i>HALOT </i>213). This approach renders the line: "He has brought me to the banquet hall, and its banner above me is love." (4) "his look toward me was loving" = "he looked at me lovingly." Several lexicons (HAW and <i>DCH</i>) relate <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">olg=D!</FONT> to the homonymic root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lg^D*</FONT> II "look, glance" (<i>DCH</i> 2:415).  The Hebrew noun <i>degel</i> II is related to the Akkadian noun <i>diglu</i> "eyesight, view, look, gaze" (<i>CAD</i> 3:21; <i>AHw</i> 1:14). Likewise, the Hebrew verb <i>dagal</i> II "to look, behold" (Song 5:10; 6:4, 10; Eccl 9:13; Ps 20:6) (BDB 186; <i>HALOT </i>213; <i>DCH</i> 2:414) is related to the Akkadian verb <i>dagalu</i> I "to look upon, to gaze, to look with astonishment, to look at with admiration" (<i>CAD</i> 3:21; <i>AHw</i> 1:14). Those who adopt this approach render the line: "His glance upon me is love" (Gesenius, Clines); "His look upon me was loving" (Gordis, Fields); or "He looked upon me with love" (Rudolph). (5) "his wish regarding me was lovemaking." Pope notes that the Assyrian noun <i>diglu</i> may denote "wish," i.e., desire or intent (<i>CAD</i> 3:136). He renders the line: "His wish regarding me was lovemaking" or "His intentions were to make love." Pope's suggestion has been adopted by several recent commentators (e.g., Carr).

It is usually defined as "apples" (KBL 1037; BDB 656); however, some argue for "apricots" (FFB 92-93). The Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">j~WPT^</FONT> ("apple") is derived from the Hebrew root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jp^n&#180;</FONT> ("scent, breath") which is related to the Arabic root <i>nafahu</i> "fragrant scent" (<i>HALOT </i>708). Hence, the term refers to a fruit with a fragrant scent. This may explain why the mere scent of this fruit was thought to have medicinal powers in the ancient Near East. See G. F. Post, <i>Flora of Syria, Palestine and Sinai</i> (London: Oxford University Press, 1932), 128. This imagery draws upon two motifs associated with apples. First, apples were viewed as medicinal in ancient Syro-Palestinian customs; the sick were given apples to eat or smell in order to revive them. Similarly, the Mishnah and Talmud refer to apples as a medication like wine and grapes. Second, apples were considered an aphrodisiac in the ancient Near East. Both motifs are combined here because the Beloved is "love-sick" and only the embrace of her beloved can cure her, as 2:6 indicates. Selected Bibliography: G. E.

The expression "faint with love" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb*h&amp;a^ tl^oj</FONT>) is a figure which compares physical or medical illness caused by a physically draining disease to sexual desire which is so intense that a person is so physically drained that they feel as if they could faint. The term "sick" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">loj</FONT>) refers to the physical weakness which consumes a person who is suffering from a medical illness (Gen 48:1; 1 Sam 19:14). It is used figuratively as a hyperbolic hypocatastasis for being so consumed with sexual desire that it saps one of his/her physical and emotional strength (BDB 317.2). This is commonly referred to as "love-sickness." It was associated with such deep longing for physical and sexual fulfillment that it weighed so heavily upon a person that he/she was physically and emotionally drained (2 Sam 13:2).<br>

The ancient Near Eastern love songs frequently portray the embrace of the lover as the only cure for the speaker's love-sickness. For example, one Egyptian love song reads: "She will make the doctors unnecessary, because she knows my sickness" (Papyrus Harris 4:11). Similarly, "My salvation is her coming in from outside; when I see her, I will be healthy. When she opens her eye, my body is young; when she speaks, I will be strong.

The verb designates an expression of love by the position or action of one's hands (<i>TWOT</i> 1:259). The term is probably used here as a euphemism for sexual stimulation. The function of the imperfect form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn]q@B=j^T=</FONT> ("embrace me") may be classified several ways: (1) ingressive: "His right hand is beginning to stimulate me," (2) instantaneous: "His right hand is stimulating me [right now]," (3) progressive: "His right hand stimulates me," (4) desire: "May his right hand stimulate me!" (5) injunction: "Let his right hand stimulate me!" or (6) permission: "His right hand may stimulate me." Based upon their view that the couple is not yet married, Glickman and Deere argue for an imperfect of desire ("May his right hand stimulate/embrace me!"). Other scholars suggest that the progressive imperfect is used ("His right hand stimulates me") (Gordis, Pope, Carr). This is supported by a strikingly similar expression in the Sumerian love song of Sumuzi-Inanna in which the woman says, "Your right hand you have placed on my vulva, your left hand stroked my head" (SMR 105). Likewise, Song 2:6 seems to depict a couple lying side by side in the normal position for foreplay to sexual intercourse with the man stimulating the woman's clitoris. Selected Bibliography: R.

Cosmic forces such as the "heavens and earth" were often personified to act as witnesses to an oath (e.g., Deut. 32:1; Isa. 1:2; Mic. 1:2; 6:1-2; Ps. 50:2). In this case, the "witnesses" are the "gazelles and stags of the field" (2:7; 3:5). These animals were frequently used as symbols of romantic love in the OT (Prov. 5:19). And in Egyptian and Mesopotamian love literature and Ugaritic poetry the gazelle was often associated with sexual fertility. For instance, in the following excerpt from a Mesopotamian incantation text the stag is referred to in the context of sexual potency in which a woman urges an ailing male: "With the love-[making of the mountain goat] six times, with the lovemaking of a stag seven times, with the lovemaking of a partridge twelve times, make love to me! Make love to me because I am young! And the lovemaking of a stag...Make love to me! (R. D. Biggs, <i>Ancient Mesopotamian Potency Incantations</i>, TCS II (1967), 26, lines 4-8).<br>

The root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rWu</FONT> is repeated twice in 2:7 for rhetorical emphasis. The first is the Hiphil imperative ("do not awake/excite...") and the second is the Polel imperative ("do not awake/start to move..."). The Hiphil depicts a causative action (causing love to initially awaken) and the Polel depicts an intensive action (repeated efforts to awaken love or to set love into motion). On the other hand, Carr writes: "The meaning is not <i>stir up</i>, i.e., a repetition of the same act, but is rather first the act of awakening or <i>summoning</i> something, and then doing what is necessary to <i>sustain</i> the activity already begun, i.e., being so fully awakened that sleep becomes impossible (e.g., 5:2)" (Carr, 94). Selected Bibliography: G. L. Carr, <i>The Song of Solomon</i> (Downers Grove: InterVarsity, 1984), 94. The terms "arouse" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wryu!T*</FONT> Hiphil imperative from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rWu</FONT>) and "awaken" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wrr+ouT=</FONT> Polel imperative from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rWu</FONT>) are probably figurative expressions (hypocatastasis) rather than literal, because the object does not refer to a person (Solomon) but to an emotional state ("love"). The Hebrew root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rWu</FONT> has a basic two-fold range of meanings: (1) to wake up and (2) to excite (<i>HALOT </i>802). These two nuances are paralleled in the related Semitic roots: Ugaritic <i>&#180;r</i> and <i>&#180;rr</i> "to be excited" (Gordon, 19.1849; 19.1926; Aistleitner, 2092) and Akkadian <i>eru</i> "to awake" (<i>AHw</i> 247) (<i>HALOT </i>802). The Hiphil stem has a four-fold range of meanings: (1) to wake up someone/something, (2) to excite, put into motion, start to work, (3) to summons, (4) to disturb (<i>HALOT </i>802-803). When used literally, the Hiphil describes waking up a sleeper (Zech 4:1) or stirring up a fire (Hos 7:4). When used figuratively, it describes stirring up (Isa 50:4; Pss 57:9; 108:3), strength (Dan 11:25), anger/wrath (Ps 78:38), jealous/zeal (Isa 42:13), and love/sexual passion (Song 2:7; 3:5; 8:4). The Polel stem has a three-fold range of meanings: (1) to awake, start to move, (2) to agitate, disturb, (3) to set in motion (<i>HALOT </i>802-803). The expression "arouse or awaken love" is figurative (hypocatastasis). It draws an implied comparison between the literal action of arousing a person from sleep and stirring him/her up to excited action, with the figurative picture of a lover sexually stirring up, arousing and exciting the sexual passions of his beloved.<br>
 <b>sn </b> (2:7) What does the expression to "arouse or awaken love" mean? There are three major views: (1) to force a love relationship to develop prematurely rather than to allow it to develop naturally (Glickman, Deere, Bettan); (2) to interfere with the experience of passionate love (Gordis); or (3) to stir up sexual passion, that is, to become sexually active (Ginsburg). As noted above, "love" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb*h&amp;a^</FONT>) probably denotes "sexual passion" (DCH 1:141; <i>HALOT </i>18) and "awaken...arouse" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rWu</FONT>) probably denote "to stir up, excite" (<i>HALOT </i>802-803).  Likewise, the verb "awake" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rWu</FONT>) is used in Song 4:16 and Hosea 7:4 in reference to stirring up sexual passion to excitement.<br>

Most commentators (e.g., Delitzsch, Pope, Glickman, Carr) and translations view this as an example of the article denoting an abstract concept. However, a few commentators (Roberts, Renan) and translations (KJV, AV, JB, NEB) view it as an abstract use of the article for the concrete (<i>abstractum pro concreto</i>), and render it as "my love" as referring either to the woman's own feelings or the feelings of her lover. Gordis freely renders the term as "our love." Throughout the Song, the term "love" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb*h&amp;a^</FONT>) is not used as a term for endearment in reference to one of the lovers; it typically refers to sexual passion (Song 2:4, 5, 7; 3:5; 5:4; 8:4, 6, 7). When used of the man/woman relationship, the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb*h&amp;a^</FONT> ("love") may refer to emotional love (Eccl. 9:1, 6; Prov. 15:17; Ps. 109:4-5) or sexual love/desire (Gen 29:20; 2 Sam 1:26; 13:4, 15; Prov. 5:19-20; 7:18; Jer 2:33; Prov 5:19-20; 7:18; Song 2:4, 5, 7; 3:5; 5:4; 8:4, 6, 7) (<i>DCH</i> 1:141; <i>HALOT </i>18). The reference to sexual desire in 2:4-5 and "love-sickness" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb*h&amp;a^ tl^oj</FONT>) in 2:5 suggests that the use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb*h&amp;a^</FONT> ("love") in 2:7 is sexual desire.

(3) If the consequences of violating the oath were extremely severe, they would not even be spoken; the statement of the consequences would be omitted for emphasis--as is the case here, that is, the apodosis is omitted for rhetorical emphasis.

In ancient Near Eastern love literature gazelles often symbolize the excitement and swiftness of the lover coming to see his beloved, as in an ancient Egyptian love song: "O that you came to your sister swiftly like a bounding gazelle! Its feet reel, its limbs are weary, terror has entered its body. A hunter pursues it with his hounds, they do not see it in its dust; It sees a resting place as a trap, it takes the river as its road.

The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rym!Z*h^</FONT> ("singing" or "pruning") is a homonym, that is, the consonants represent two distinct and entirely separate roots. The homonymic root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rym!z*</FONT> I means "song, singing" (<i>HALOT </i>273a; <i>DCH</i> 3:117a), while <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rym!z*</FONT> II means "pruning, trimming" (<i>HALOT </i>273b; <i>DCH</i> 3:117b).  The intended root is debated among the ancient versions (LXX, Aquila, Symmachus, Vulgate, Targum), Hebrew lexicographers (<i>HALOT </i>273; <i>DCH</i> 3:117), Jewish interpreters (Rashi, Qimhi, Ibn Ezra, Rashbam), Christian interpreters (Luther, Meek, Delitzsch, Pope, Carr), and translations: "singing" (KJV, NIV, NASB margin, NJPS margin), "pruning" (NASB, NJPS). However, rather than choosing between these two roots, it is likely that this is an example of intentional ambiguity. The preceding line draws out the meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rym!z*</FONT> I ("trimming, pruning"): "The pomegranates are seen in the land, the time of pruning has come." The following line draws out the meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rym!z*</FONT> II ("singing"): "The time of singing has come, the voice of the turtledove is heard in the land." This homonymic wordplay creates an example of "janus parallelism" between the three poetic lines which play off of both root meanings of the intentionally ambiguous homonym. This elegant wordplay and the AB:BA "janus parallelism" may be represented thus: "The pomegranates are seen in the land, the time has come for <i>pruning</i> // <i>singing</i>, the voice of the turtledove is heard in the land."<br>
 <a name="fn104" href="sos.htm#fnB104"><sup>37</sup></a><b>sn </b> (2:14) The dove was a common figure for romantic love in ancient Near Eastern love literature. This emphasis seems to be suggested by his use of the term "my dove." Just as Solomon heard the voice of the turtledove in 2:12, so now Solomon wants to hear her voice. Doves were often associated with timidity in the ancient world. Being virtually defenseless, they would often take refuge in crevices and cliffs for safety (Jer 48:28). The emphasis on timidity and the need for security is undoubtedly the emphasis here because of the explicit description of this "dove" hiding in the "clefts of the rock" and in "the hiding-places of the mountain crevice." Fortresses were sometimes built in the clefts of the rocks on mountainsides because they were inaccessible and therefore, in a secure place of safety (Jer 49:16; Obad 3). The point of comparison here seems to be that Solomon realized that it might be intimidating for her to join him and to communicate with him freely and in a transparent manner. She would have to feel secure and safe in his love in order to do this. It would be easy for her to hide from such emotionally exposing experiences.<br>

Some commentators suggest that the woman is speaking to a large audience, perhaps the maidens of Jerusalem mentioned in 2:7. However, the Hebrew plural can function in an intensive sense when used in reference to a single individual (Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 7.4.3.a). As noted previously, the bride often uses the plural in reference to herself or to her bridegroom in Sumerian love literature. Thus, the woman simply may be speaking to her beloved, as in 2:16-17, but with particularly intense passion.<br>

For instance, in Egyptian love song it is the crocodile, rather than the foxes, which were used as figures for obstacles which might threaten a couple's love. Here the "foxes" are probably used figuratively to represent potentially destructive problems which could destroy their romantic relationship and which could hinder it from ripening into marriage.<br>
 <a name="fn108" href="sos.htm#fnB108"><sup>41</sup></a><b>sn </b> (2:15) The term "vineyard" is also a figure. In 1:6 she used the vineyard motif as a metaphor for her physical appearance, but here it is "our vineyards" which is probably a figure for their romantic relationship.

The latter would picture Solomon as a shepherd pasturing his flock among a bed of flowers which they were eating, while the former would be picturing him as a gazelle feeding among a bed of flowers. Because of the occurrence of the gazelle motif in the following verse, it is most likely that this motif is present in this verse as well. That gazelles actually did feed among lilies in the ancient Near East, W. M. Thomson writes on the basis of personal observation, "Gazelles still delight to feed among them [i.e., lilies], and you can scarcely ride through the woods north of Tabor, where the lilies abound, without frightening them from their flowery pastures." Although it seems likely that Solomon is therefore being pictured as a gazelle eating these flowers, it is far from clear as to what this figurative picture denotes. It is possible that it conveys the peaceful nature of his relationship with her because she was earlier portrayed as a lily (e.g., 2:1).<br>

Thus, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rt#b* yr}h*</FONT> might mean "mountains of gorge[s] or "mountains of Bether" (<i>DCH</i> 2:291). The Hebrew root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rt^B*</FONT> "cut in pieces, cut in half" is related to Arabic <i>batara</i> "to cut off" (<i>HALOT </i>167; BDB 144). The word does not appear in Ugaritic, Akkadian, or Syriac. Aramaic <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rt^aB*</FONT> ("after, behind") was used frequently in Northwest Semitic (<i>DISO</i> 45-46) and Late Hebrew (Jastrow 1:201); however, it offers little to this problem. Many scholars take <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rt#B#</FONT> as a genitive of description functioning as an attributive adjective. For example, BDB suggests that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rt#B#</FONT> means "mountains of cutting," that is, "cleft mountains" (BDB 144), while Koehler posits "ravine," that is, mountains with a ravine (<i>HALOT </i>167).

This approach is adopted by several translations, e.g., "rugged mountains" (NIV).

This approach is adopted by several translations: "mountains of Bether" (AV, RSV, NASB, NIV margin). Theodotion takes it as a figurative expression, reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">qumiamatwn</FONT> ("incense") which reflects a variant Hebrew reading of  <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ym!?*B=</FONT> ("balsam, perfume") which also appears in Song 8:14.

The expression "cleft mountains" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rt#b* yr}h*</FONT>) might refer simply to a rugged and jagged mountain-range (NIV "rugged mountains"). However, this may be a figurative description of the woman's cleavage because similar imagery is used in Song 4:6 to describe her breasts. The name "Tihamah" (literally "the Great Deep") was applied to the low-lying coastland between the mountains of Yemen and the Red Sea as well as to the depression of Djauf (Dumah) because of fresh-water springs which oozed up from below (Hebrew "Tehom" and "Tehomot," Ugaritic "Tihamaten" or "Tahamatum," Akkadian "Tiamat"). And it appears that in an Ammonite inscription that an area near the mountainous region of Rabbath-Amman is referred to by the name "Tymtn" (literally "The Two Depressions"), rather than by its real name.

The plural form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tolyL@B^</FONT> from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hl*y+l^</FONT> ("night") can be classified in several ways: (1) plural of number: "night after night" (NASB, NEB); (2) plural of extension: "all night long" (NIV); (3) plural of composition: "by night" (KJV) and "at night" (NJPS); or (4) plural of intensity: "during the blackest night" (Deere). The plural of extension ("all night long") is supported by (1) the four-fold repetition of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vq^B*</FONT> ("to seek") in 3:1-2 which emphasizes that the Beloved was continually looking for her lover all night long, (2) her decision to finally arise in the middle of the night to look for Solomon in 3:2-4, and (3) her request in the immediately preceding verse (2:17) that Solomon make love to her all night long: "until the day breathes and the shadows flee...." One should note, however, that the plural <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tolyL@B^ </FONT>occurs in 3:8 where it is a plural of composition: "by night" (NJPS) or "of the night" (NASB, NIV) or "in the night" (KJV).

In 2:17 the woman invited her beloved to make love to her all night long; however, in 3:1 she recounts a nightmarish experience in which she was unable to find her beloved next to her in bed. Scholars debate whether 3:1-4 recounts a nightmare-like dream sequence or a real-life experience. There are striking parallels between 3:1-4 and 5:2-8 which also raises the possibility of a nightmare-like dream sequence.<br>

However, it is clear in 3:1 that this "search" took place upon her bed. It does not make sense in the context that the Beloved was looking around in her bed to find her lover--how big could her bed be that she had lost Solomon? Rather, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vq^B*</FONT> ("to seek") is used metonymically to reference to her longing for her absent lover, that is, seeking in the sense of anticipation. The perfect tense should be classified as a past constantive action, describing a past action which covered an extended period of time, as indicated by the phrase "all night long" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tolyL@B^</FONT> plural of extension) in 3:1. This continual action is emphasized by the four-fold repetition of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vq^B*</FONT> ("seek") in 3:1-2.<br>

The expression "my soul" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yv!p=n~</FONT>) is often used as independent personal pronoun. It often expresses personal preference, such as love or hatred (e.g., Gen 27:4, 25; Lev 26:11, 30; Judg 5:24; Isa 1:14) (<i>HALOT </i>712). The term "soul" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp#n\</FONT>) is used over 150 times in OT to refer to the seat of a person's emotions and passions (BDB 660c.6a) (e.g., Deut 12:15, 20, 21; 14:26; 18:6; 21:14; 24:15; 1 Sam 3:21; 23:30; 2 Sam 14:14; 1 Kgs 11:37; Isa 26:8; Jer 2:24; 22:27; 34:16; 44:14; Ezek 16:27; Hos 4:8; Mic 7:1; Pss 10:3; 24:4; 25:1; 35:25; 78:18; 86:4; 105:22; 143:8; Prov 13:4; 19:8; 21:10; Job 23:13; Song 5:6). It is often refers to the seat of love (BDB 660d.6e) (e.g., Gen 34:3, 8; Jer 12:7; Ps 63:9; Song 1:7; 3:1-4). The expression <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yv!p=n~ hb*h&amp;a*v#-ta@ </FONT>"the one whom I love" (<i>Heb</i> "the one whom my soul loves") is repeated four times in 3:1-4. The repetition emphasizes her intense love for her beloved. The noun "love" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb*h&amp;a*</FONT>) is often used in reference to the love between a man and woman, particularly in reference to emotional, romantic, or sexual love (2 Sam 1:26; 13:15; Prov 5:19; 7:18; Song 2:4-5, 7; 3:5; 5:8; 8:4, 6-7; Jer 2:2, 33). Likewise, the verb "to love" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bh@a*</FONT>) often refers to emotional, romantic, or sexual love between a man and woman (e.g., Gen 24:67; 29:20, 30, 32; 34:3; Deut 21:15, 16; Judg 14:16; 16:4, 15; 1 Sam 1:5; 18:20; 2 Sam 13:1, 4, 15; 1 Kgs 11:1; 2 Chr 11:21; Neh 13:26; Esth 2:17; Eccl 9:9; Song 1:3, 4, 7; 3:1-4; Jer 22:20, 22; Ezek 16:33, 36-37; 23:5, 9, 22; Hos 2:7-15; 3:1; Lam 1:19).<br>

The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ax*m* </FONT>("to find") normally describes discovering the whereabouts of something/someone who is lost or whose presence is not known. It is clear in 3:1 that the Beloved was not taking a physically active role in looking all around for Solomon, because she stayed in her bed all night long during this time. Therefore, the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ax*m*</FONT> ("to find") must be nuanced metonymically in terms of Solomon appearing to her. It does not denote "finding" Solomon physically, but visually; that is, if and when Solomon would arrive at her bedside, she would "find" him. This might allude to her request in 2:17 for Solomon to rendevous with her to make love to her all night long ("until the day breathes and the shadows flee"). Despite the fact that she was waiting for him all night long, he never appeared (3:1). The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ax*m* </FONT>("to find") is repeated four times in 3:1-4, paralleling the four-fold repetition of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vq^B* </FONT>("to seek").

These cohortatives have been taken in two basic senses: (1) resolve: "I will arise...I will go about...I will seek" (KJV, NIV) or (2) necessity: "I must arise...I must go about...I must seek" (NASB, NJPS). There is no ethical or moral obligation/necessity, but the context emphasizes her intense determination (e.g., 3:4b). Therefore, they should be classified as cohortatives of resolve, expressing the speaker's determination to pursue a course of action (e.g., Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 34.5.1). The three-fold repetition of the cohortative form emphasizes the intensity of her determination.<br>
 <b>tn </b> (3:2) The emphatic particle of exhortation <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">an</FONT> appears in the expression <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aN&#180; hm*Wqa*</FONT> ("I will arise...).

The Israelite night watchmen of the walls is paralleled by the Akkadian <i>sahir duri</i> ("one who goes around the wall") which appears in a lexical text as the equivalent of <i>ma</i>-<i>sar</i> <i>musi</i> ("night watchman") (<i>CAD</i> 4:192). Selected Bibliography: M. H. Pope, <i>Song of Songs</i> (Garden City: Doubleday, 1982), 419.

This wordplay draws attention to the ironic similarity between the woman's action and the action of the city's watchmen.

The negative expression "to not let [someone or something] go" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hp*r&#180; aO</FONT>) denotes an intense desire or effort to not lose possession of someone or something (Job 27:6; Prov 4:13).

The literary/syntactical structure of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WNP#r+a^ aOw+ wyT!z=j^a&amp;</FONT> ("I grasped him and I would not let him go") in 3:4 mirrors that of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wyt!ax*m= aOw+ wyT!v=Q^B! </FONT>("I searched for him but I could not find him") in 3:1-2.

Campbell notes that the mother's house is sometimes referred to as the place where marital plans were made (Gen 24:28; Ruth 1:8). Campbell suggests, then, that the woman here was unusually bold and took the lead in proposing marriage plans with her beloved. This approach emphasizes that the marriage plans in 3:4 are followed by the royal wedding procession (3:6-11) and the wedding night (4:1-5:1). On the other hand, Fields suggests that the parallelism of "house of my mother" and "chamber of she who conceived me" focuses on the bedroom of her mother's house. Fields suggests that her desire was to make love to her beloved in the very bedroom chambers where she herself was conceived, to complete the cycle of life/love. If this is the idea, it would provide a striking parallel to a similar picture in 8:5 in which the woman exults that they had made love in the very location where her beloved had been conceived: "Under the apple tree I aroused you; it was there your mother conceived you, there she who bore you conceived you."

In Middle Hebrew the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ar&#180;f=q!</FONT> meant "to steam, smell" (Qal) and "to smoke" (Hiphil).

The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hF*m! </FONT>("bed, couch") itself can refer to a number of similar but different kinds of pieces of reclining furniture: (1) the bed of a common person, found in the bedchamber for reposing and sleeping at night (Gen 47:31; 48:2; 49:33; Exod 8:3[7:28]; 2 Sam 4:7; 1 Kgs 17:19; 2 Kgs 4:10, 21, 32; Ps 6:6[7]; Prov 26:14); (2) the royal bed of the king or nobility, often elevated and made of expensive materials (1 Kgs 21:4; 2 Kgs 1:4, 6, 16; 2 Chr 24:25; Esth 7:8; Amos 6:4; Ezek 23:41); (3) the couch of a common person for reclining or sitting during the day (1 Sam 28:23); (4) a royal banqueting couch for reclining at feasts or carousing (Ezek 23:41; Amos 3:12; 6:4; Esth 1:6; 7:8); (5) a portable light-weight bed for transporting the sick (1 Sam 19:15); (6) a portable bed, such as a funeral bier for transporting the dead (2 Sam 3:31); and (7) a portable royal couch for transporting the king (Song 3:7). The royal couch was often made of expensive materials, such as ivory, silver, and gold (Ezek 23:41; Amos 6:4; Song 3:9-10; Esth 1:6).<br>
 <a name="fn139" href="sos.htm#fnB139"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:8) <i>Heb</i> "trained of sword" or "girded of sword." Alternately, "girded with swords."

Most translations adopt this approach, although differing on whether the participle functions substantivally (NASB), verbally (KJV, NIV), or adjectivally (RSV), they all are heading in the same direction: "[all] hold swords" (KJV), "girded with sword" (RSV), "wielders of the sword" (NASB), and "wearing the sword" (NIV). This, however, provides only a vague parallel with the following colon: "trained in warfare" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*j*l=m! yd@M=l%m=</FONT>). (2) Others, however, suggest taking <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">zja</FONT> in its rare metaphorical sense of "to learn" (= mentally grasp, take hold of): "learned, skillful" (Gordis, <i>The Song of Songs</i>, 85; Lewy <i>HUCA</i> 11-12:98-99; Bertholet, <i>Driver Festschrift</i>, 145-46). This nuance is much more common in the related Akkadian verb <i>ahazu</i> "to learn," as Koehler-Baumgartner note (<i>HALOT </i>31). Likewise, JB renders it "skilled swordsmen," and NJPS suggests "trained in warfare" for Song 3:8, citing Akkadian <i>ahazu</i> "to learn." The Akkadian verb <i>ahazu </i>has a broad range of meanings including: (1) to seize, hold a person, (2) to take a wife, to marry, (3) to hold, possess, take over, grasp something, to take to (a region), and (4) to learn, to understand (<i>CAD</i> 1:1:173). The concrete, physical sense of grasping or taking an object in one's hands lent itself to the metaphorical sense of mentally grasping something, that is, learning or understanding. The category <i>ahazu</i> 4 ("to learn, to understand") is used in reference to general learning, as well to specialized knowledge involving a special skill, professional craft, or ability acquired through instruction and experience (<i>CAD</i> 1:1:177). The causative form <i>suhuzu</i> means "to teach, educate, train" someone to become a skilled craftsman in a professional trade (<i>CAD</i> 1:1:180). This provides a tight parallelism with the following colon: "skillful in swordsmanship" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">br\j# yz@j%a&amp;</FONT>) precisely parallels "well-trained in [the art of] warfare" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*j*l=m! yd@M=l%m=</FONT>). The AB:AB parallelism between the two lines is exact: (1) <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yz@j%a&amp;</FONT> "learned, skillful" (Qal passive participle mpl construct from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">zja</FONT> "to learn, be skillful") parallels <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yd@M=l%m=</FONT> "trained, instructed" (Pual participle mpl construct from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dm^l*</FONT> "to train, instruct"), and (2) <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">br\j#</FONT> "in respect to swordsmanship" (genitive of specification or limitation) exactly parallels <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*j*l=m!</FONT> "in regard to [the art of] warfare" (genitive of specification or limitation). The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">br\j#</FONT> ("sword") may be nuanced metonymically as "swordsmanship" in the light of (a) its collocation with terms for professional expertise: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ydM= %lm=</FONT> ("trained") and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yz@j%a&amp;</FONT> ("skilled"), and (b) the connotation "swordsmanship" can be sustained in a few cases, e.g., "It was not by their swordsmanship that they won the land, nor did their arm bring them victory" (Ps 44:3). In the genitive construct phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">br\j# yz@j%a&amp;</FONT>, the genitive noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">br\j#</FONT> ("sword") may be classified either as (1) a genitive of specification; "[skilled] in respect to swordsmanship" or (2) a genitive of instrument; "[skilled] with a sword."<br>

There are several views of the origin of the term: (1) LXX Greek <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">forei&#180;on</FONT> "bridal-litter" is a loanword from Hebrew; the term is not used in Greek until the Koine period (Liddell-Scott, <i>Greek-English Lexicon</i>, 1950-51); (2) Sanskrit <i>paryanka</i> and <i>palki</i> "palanquin, sedan-chair" (Monier-Williams, <i>Sanskrit-English Dictionary</i> [Oxford: Clarendon, 1884], 554); (3) Old Persian <i>upariyana</i> "litter-bed" (R. Gordis, "A Wedding Song for Solomon," <i>JBL</i> 63 (1944): 263-70; G. Widengren, <i>Sakrales Konigtum im Alten Testament und im Judentum</i> [Stuttgart, 1955], 122); (4) less likely is Ugaritic <i>apn</i> "two-wheeled cart" (Gordon 305); and (5) Egyptian <i>pr</i> "house" with the prefix <i>ua</i> and suffix <i>yn</i> meaning "palace" (G. Gerleman, "Die Bildsprache des Hohenliedes und die altegyptische Kunst," <i>ASTI</i> 1 (1962): 24-30). A palanquin was a riding vehicle upon which a royal person sat and which was carried by servants who lifted it up by its staffs. Royalty and members of the aristocracy only rode in palanquins. McKenzie describes what the typical royal palanquin was made of and looked like in the ancient world: "Only the aristocracy appear to have made use of litters in Israel. At a later period, in Greece, and even more so in Rome, distinguished citizens were carried through the city streets in splendid palanquins. In Egypt the litter was known as early as the third millennium B.C., as is testified by the one belonging to Queen Hetepheres, the mother of the Pharaoh Khufu (Cheops), which was found at Gaza. This litter is made of wood and inlaid in various places with gold decorations. Its total length is 6 ft. 10 in., and the length of the seat inside is 3 ft. 3 in. An inscription on the litter, of gold set in ebony, lists the queen's titles" (J. L. McKenzie, "Song of Solomon," in <i>The Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Living Bible</i> (Chicago: San Francisco Productions, Inc., 1967), 55).<br>

In the genitive construct phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/onb*L=h^ yx@u&amp;m@</FONT> ("the wood of Lebanon") the genitive functions as a genitive of place of origin: "wood from Lebanon." The plural construct noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yx@u&amp;</FONT> (literally, "trees, woods" from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ju@</FONT> "tree, wood") is a plural of composition: the plural is used to indicate composition, that is, what the sedan-chair was made out of. The plural is used because the sedan-chair was constructed from the wood from several trees or it was constructed from several pieces of wood (see Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 7.4.1b; Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 9; Jo&uuml;on-Muraoka, <i>Grammar</i>, &#167;136.b).<br>

The elaborate and expensive nature of the procession is emphasized in this description. This litter was constructed with the finest and most expensive materials. The litter itself was made from the very best wood: cedar and cypress from Lebanon. These were the same woods which Solomon used in constructing the temple (1 Kgs 5:13-28). Silver was overlaid over the "posts," which were either the legs of the litter or the uprights which supported its canopy, and the "back" of the litter was overlaid with gold. The seat was made out of purple material, which was an emblem of royalty and which was used in the tabernacle (Exod 26:1f; 27:16; 28:5-6) and in the temple (2 Chr 3:14). Thus, the litter was made of the very best which Solomon could offer. Such extravagance reflected his love for his Beloved who rode upon it and would be seen upon it by all the Jerusalemites as she came into the city.<br>

It may be related to the masculine noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dp^r&#180;</FONT> "camping place, station" referring to a stopping point in the wilderness march of Israel (Exod 17:1, 8; 19:2; Num 33:14); however, what any semantic connection might be is difficult to discern. The versions have translated <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hd*yp!r+</FONT> variously: LXX <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajnavkliton</FONT> ("chair for reclining"), Vulgate <i>reclinatorium</i> ("support, back-rest of a chair") Peshitta <i>teshwiteh</i> <i>dahba</i> ("golden cover, throne sheathed in gold leaf"). Modern translators have taken three basic approaches: (1) Following the LXX and Vulgate ("support, rest, back of a chair"), BDB suggests "support," referring to the back or arm of the chair of palanquin (BDB 951). Several translations take this view, e.g., NRSV: "its back," NEB/REB: "its headrest," and NJPS: "its back." (2) Koehler-Baumgartner suggest "base, foundation of a saddle, litter" (KBL 905). Several translations follow this approach, e.g., KJV: "the bottom," NASB: "its base" (margin: "its support," and NIV: "its base." (3) Gerleman suggests the meaning "cover," as proposed by Peshitta. The first two approaches are more likely than the third. Thus, it probably refers either to (1) the back of the sedan-chair of the palanquin or (2) the foundation/base of the saddle/litter upon which the palanquin rested (<i>HALOT </i>1278).<br>

The Hebrew term refers to wool dyed with red purple (<i>BRL2</i> 153; <i>HALOT </i>84).

Purple cloth and fabrics were costly (Ezek 27:7, 16) and were commonly worn by kings as a mark of their royal position (Judg 8:26). Thus, this was a sedan-chair fit for a king. KJV and NIV render it simply as "purple," NASB as "purple fabric," and NJPS "purple wool."<br>

The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb*h&amp;a^</FONT> is a homonymic noun therefore, there is an interesting little debate whether <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb*h&amp;a^ </FONT>in 3:10 is from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb*h&amp;a^</FONT> I "love" (BDB 13; <i>DCH</i> 1:141) or <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbha</FONT> II "leather" (<i>HALOT </i>18). The homonymic root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb*h&amp;a^</FONT> II "leather" is related to Arabic <i>&#180;ihab</i> "leather" or "untanned skin" (Driver, Loewenstamm). It probably occurs in Hos 11:4 and may also appear in Song 3:10 (<i>HALOT </i>18). Traditionally, scholars and translations have rendered this term as "love" or "lovingly." The reference to the "daughters of Jerusalem" suggests "love" because they had "loved" Solomon (1:4). However, the context describes the materials out of which the palanquin was made (3:9-10) thus, an interior made out of leather would certainly make sense. Perhaps the best solution is to see this as an example of intentional ambiguity in a homonymic wordplay: "Its interior was inlaid with leather // love by the maidens of Jerusalem."

 <a name="fn151" href="sos.htm#fnB151"><sup>39</sup></a><b>sn </b> (3:11) Song 4:1-7 is often compared to ancient Near Eastern <i>wasfs</i> songs sung by the groom to his new bride, praising her beauty from head to foot. Examples have been found in Egyptian, Syrian, Sumerian, and Arabic love literature. The wasfs song is a poetic celebration by the groom of his bride's physical beauty. The typical form has three parts: (1) introductory words by the wedding guests, (2) invitation by the bride to the groom to celebrate her physical beauty, and (3) the groom's poetic comparative praise of his bride's beauty from head to foot--comprising the bulk of the song. The groom's praise typically is characterized by three movements: (1) introductory summary praise of his bride's beauty, (2) lengthy and detailed figurative description of her physical beauty, and (3) concluding summary praise which reiterates the introductory words of the song. Although the introductory words of the wedding guests and the invitation by the bride are absent, the form of the Lover's praise of his bride is identical, as are the types of comparative praise. Solomon's song falls into the same three movements: (1) introductory summary praise of his bride's beauty in 4:1a, (2) lengthy and detailed figurative description of her beauty in 4:1b-6, and (3) concluding summary praise in 4:7.

On the other hand, many Jewish and Christian interpreters have suggested that this is a comparison of sense, usually suggesting that the dove is a symbol for purity and that the eyes of a person are the windows of their soul or character, that is, the bride has a pure character as can be seen through her eyes.<br>

The Hebrew Piel verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[L@T!</FONT> means "to hang up for display," thus NEB suggests that it is derived from <i>lpy</i> which means "to arrange in courses," i.e., "layered," as a reference to the Bride's layered necklace she wears. The NIV nuances it as "with elegance" and NEB "winding courses." Perles connects <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toYP!l=t^</FONT> to Akkadian <i>tilpanu</i> ("bow"), while Haupt connects the word with the Shaphel stem of the Akkadian <i>labu</i> ("to fortify"). Honeyman suggests that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toYP!l=t^l=</FONT> is a feminine plural noun of the <i>taqtilat</i> nominal pattern from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ypl</FONT> which means "to arrange in courses." <i>HALOT</i> notes that the phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toYP!l=t^l= yWnB*</FONT> has been rendered in several ways: (1) "built with turrets," (2) "built with siege-towers," (3) "built in rows (of stones)" or "built in terraces." Haupt and Krauss suggest that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toYP!l=t^l=</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yWnB*</FONT> denotes "constructed for siege-towers" or "built for an armory." Honeyman suggests that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toYP!l=t^</FONT> is a feminine plural noun with a standard nominative prefix <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">t</FONT> and is derived from the verbal root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">apl</FONT> ("to arrange in stones"). Probably, the simplest solution is to relate this Hebrew root to Akkadian <i>lapu</i> ("to surround, enclose"), Arabic <i>laffa</i> or <i>lifafah</i> ("to envelope"), and Aramaic <i>lpp</i> and <i>lp</i>' ("to interlace, entwine, plait"). This is the simplest solution and does not demand emending the text. The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l=</FONT> could denote "in respect to" and the colon <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toYP!l=t^l= yWnB*</FONT> could be translated "built in rows (of stones)" or "built in terraces." Thus, the phrase "built in rows of stones" refers to the outer walls of a tower built in spiraling rows of stones or built in terraces. This is a comparison of sight: (1) her neck was long and symmetrical or (2) she was wearing a strand of beads or necklaces wrapped around her neck like a tower built in spiraling rows of stones.

 <a name="fn160" href="sos.htm#fnB160"><sup>9</sup></a> <b>tn </b> (4:4) Scholars debate whether this refers to (1) the interior walls of a tower upon which warriors would hang their shields when not in use or (2) the external upper wall of a military fortress upon which warriors would hang their shields to add to their protection during battle. A few scholars who suggest that what is pictured here are the internal walls of the tower and, on the basis of Ezek. 27:10-11, posit that in the ancient world there was a practice in which mercenaries, who had joined themselves to a king, would hang their shields upon his fortress wall as a sign of their allegiance. Following Crim, Deere suggests, "the custom of hanging shields on the tower was symbolic of the warriors' allegiance to and valor for a particular king." Crim suggests that the point of comparison of Solomon's praise would be something similar to what follows: "Just as the fame of Tyre in Ezek. 27:11 attracted mercenaries, the fame of the tower of David has attracted soldiers to come and enter its service. The shields hanging there show that they have given their allegiance to the tower. Your neck is like that tower. It is so beautiful that it could win the allegiance of a thousand heroic soldiers." We would then translate something like this: "Your neck attracts men as the tower of David attracts warriors. A thousand heroic soldiers would swear allegiance to your beauty." Deere suggests that the point of the comparison is that the bride's neck was so beautiful and majestic that mighty warriors from near and far would have given their allegiance to her...It is as if he were saying that these soldiers would be willing to surrender their shields to her beauty. On the other hand, most scholars suggest that it refers to the common practice in the ancient Near East of lining the top wall of a military fortress tower with shields, behind which the soldiers could stand for protection leaving both hands free for bow and arrows (Note: It is possible to view Ezek 27:10-11 and 2 Chr 32:5 in this manner). This is supported by ancient Near Eastern art which pictures such a practice, especially by the relief of Sennacherib's siege of Lachish which shows the top wall of Lachish lined with shields. McKenzie notes: "The art of the ancient East often shows us the shields that were, in time of war, set in position on the towers of the city walls, so that defenders could safely fire arrows and hurl stones while standing upright behind them." Those who see this as the imagery all agree that the point of comparison is to jeweled necklaces with pendants which could be compared to shields, as in 1:10-11 (A. Robert, T. J. Meek, G. Gerlemann, A. M. Honeyman, B. S. J. Isserlin, J. McKenzie). McKenzie expresses this view when he posits that she was wearing jewelry around her neck and that this was being compared to the shields hung around this military tower: "One of the many physical charms that the Beloved finds in his mistress (Song of Sol. 4:1-4) is her long neck which, with its stately poise, reminds him of the lofty tower of David. Just as this tower is hung all round with shields placed there by mighty men of valor, so is his mistress' neck adorned with chains and strings of jewels (McKenzie, ibid). This is supported by the fact that 4:9 explicitly mentions a necklace with a multitude of jewels in it which she was wearing at this time. And Isserlin suggests that the complete image in view fits the evidence of both ancient Near Eastern military towers and jewelry which has been recovered archaeologically: "It seems to the present writer that a reading of the verse...can be taken to refer to the presence not of one, but two elements on the tower: there is the coursed masonry, and on top of it there are the shields. If we keep the idea that a multiple necklace is alluded to, then this should be made up of two kinds of elements: on top there should be a series of beads resembling round shields; below we should find something resembling either the short or the long side of building stones (according to whether the masonry is laid in headers or stretchers). Can necklaces of this type be found in the ancient Near East? It seems to the writer that the well-known sculpture from Arsos in Cyprus (Pl. VI) represents just this type of necklace. The upper beads do look like a row of round shields, as shown on the tower in the relief slab representing Sennacherib's siege of Lachish, while the lower elements do evoke roughly bossed headers, as found in ancient Palestinian defence works" (B. S. J. Isserlin, 59 and pl. VI). Composite necklaces such as this one might be referred to in Prov 1:9. In any case, it is quite unlikely that the point of comparison was that she had a large, muscular neck, as some have suggested (M. Jastrow, L. Waterman, and R. Gordis). Selected Bibliography: A. M.

While the Niphal stem has a metonymical nuance (cause for effect): to get heart, that is, to get understanding (Job 11:12), the Piel stem may have a private nuance: to take away heart, that is, to take away the senses. Her beauty was so overwhelming that it robbed him of his senses (e.g., Hos 4:11). This is paralleled by a modern Palestinian love song: "She stood opposite me and deprived me of reason (literally, "took my heart"), your dark eyes slew me while I was singing, your eyebrows drove shame from me...the darkness of your eyes have slain me; O one clad in purple clothes, it is worthwhile falling in love with you, for your eyes are black and sparkle, and have slain me indeed." Less likely is the proposal of Waldeman who relates this to Akkadian <i>lababu</i> ("to rage, be aroused to fury"), suggesting that Song 4:9 means "to become passionately aroused" or "to be aroused sexually."

This probably reflects any one of several ancient Near Eastern customs: (1) The appelatives "my sister" and "my brother" were both commonly used in ancient Near Eastern love literature as figurative descriptions of two lovers. For instance, in a Ugaritic poem when Anat tried to seduce Aqhat, she says, "Hear, O hero Aqhat, you are my brother and I your sister" (Aqhat 18 i. 24). In the OT Apocrypha husband and wife are referred to several times as "brother" and "sister" (Add Esth 15:9; Tob 5:20; 7:16). This "sister-wife" motif might be behind Paul's perplexing statement about a "sister-wife" (1 Cor 9:5). (2) In several Mesopotamian societies husbands actually could legally adopted their wives for a variety of reasons. For instance, in Hurrian society husbands in the upper classes sometimes adopted their wives as "sisters" in order to form the strongest of all possible marriage bonds; a man could divorce his wife but he could not divorce his "sister" because she was "family." At Nuzi a husband could adopt his wife to give her a higher status in society. Selected Bibliography: M. Held, "A Faithful Lover in Old Babylonian Dialogue," <i>JCS</i> 15 (1961): 1-26 and S. S.

There are five options: (1) Solomon is addressing his bride, (2) the bride is addressing Solomon, (3) the wedding guests are addressing Solomon and his bride, (4) Solomon and his bride are addressing the wedding guests, or (5) the poet is addressing Solomon and his bride. When dealing with this issue, the following factors should be considered: (1) the form of both the exhortations and the addressees are plural. This makes it unlikely that Solomon is addressing his bride or that his bride is addressing him. (2) The exhortation has an implicitly sexual connotation because the motif of "eating" and "drinking" refers to sexual consummation in 5:1a. This makes it unlikely that Solomon or his bride are addressing the wedding guests--an orgy is quite out of the question! (3) The poet could be in view because as the writer who created the Song, only he could have been with them--in a poetic sense--in the bridal chamber as a "guest" on their wedding night. (4) The wedding guests could be in view through the figurative use of apostrophe (addressing an audience that is not in the physical presence of the speaker). While the couple was alone in their wedding chambers, the wedding guests wished them all the joys and marital bliss of the honeymoon. This is supported by several factors: (a) Wedding feasts in the ancient Near East frequently lasted several days and after the couple had consummated their marriage, they would appear again to celebrate a feast with their wedding guests. (b) The structure of the Song is composed of paired-dialogues which either begin or conclude with the words of the friends or daughters of Jerusalem (1:2-4, 5-11; 3:6-11; 5:9-16; 6:1-3, 4-13; 7:1-10) or which conclude with an exhortation addressed to them (2:1-7; 3:1-5; 8:1-4).

When used with the accusative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tl#D#</FONT> ("door"), it refers to opening a door (e.g., Judg 3:25; 19:27; 1 Sam 3:15; 2 Kgs 9:3, 10; 2 Chr 29:3; Job 31:32) (<i>HALOT </i>986-89; BDB 835). Although the object <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tl#D#</FONT> ("door") is here omitted, a bedroom door is clearly in mind in 5:2, as indicated by the collocated verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qp^D*</FONT> ("to knock on a door") in the preceding line. Translators have often rendered this line woodenly: "Open to me!" (KJV, NASB, NIV); however, NJPS nuances it well: "Let me in!"<br>
 <b>sn </b> (5:2) The three-fold repetition of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jt^P* </FONT>("to open") (Song 5:2, 5, 6) indicates that it is a key word (<i>Leitwort</i>) in this section. While it is clear that the verb describes her action of opening the door of her bedroom chamber in 5:2, some suggest that in 5:5-6 it is used figuratively (hypocatastasis: implied comparison) of the Beloved "opening" her female genitalia for sexual intercourse (but see study notes below).<br>
 <a name="fn180" href="sos.htm#fnB180"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn </b> (5:4) Possibly a euphemism (<i>double entendre</i>). The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dy&#180;</FONT> ("hand") normally refers simply to the physical hand (<i>HALOT </i>386.1; BDB 388.1). There are, however, at least three occasions when <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dy&#180;</FONT> refers to tall stone pillars (translated "monument" or "pillar"), such as those used in Canaanite fertility-cults in the form of phallic representations (1 Sam 15:12; 2 Sam 18:18; Isa 56:5). There are also three times when it is clearly used as a euphemism for the male copulative organ (Isa 57:8, 10; Jer 5:31; 50:15). It is now an established fact that <i>yad</i> is sometimes used as a euphemism for the male sexual organ in Ugaritic literature (e.g., text no. 52:33-35) (C. H. Gordon, <i>UT</i> &#167;1072; J. Aistleitner, <i>WUS</i> &#167;1139). The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dy&#180;</FONT> is also used in the Qumran literature in this sense in a list of penalties for indecent exposure (Manual of Discipline 7:12-15). Thus, several scholars suggest that a subtle <i>double entendre</i> in 5:4-6. The imagery of Solomon thrusting his "hand" through the "hole" in the door, and the Beloved "opening" to her lover, while her fingers dripped with "myrrh" on the "handles of the lock," might have a double reference to the literal attempt of Solomon to gain entry to her bedroom and his desire to make love to her.

 <a name="fn181" href="sos.htm#fnB181"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn </b> (5:4) <i>Heb</i> "sent his hand through." Most scholars suggest that it denotes "to send through," that is, "to thrust through" or "to extend through." For example, BDB 1018.3a proposes that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m!</FONT> + <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jl^v*</FONT> means "to stretch out (his hand) from the outside, inward." Solomon was attempting to open the door from the outside by extending his hand inside the door through some kind of latch-opening: "he put in his hand by the opening of the door" (KJV), "he extended his hand through the opening" (NASB), "he thrust his hand through the latch-opening" (NIV). Others, however, suggests that the construction <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m!</FONT> + <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jl^v* </FONT>denotes "to withdraw from" (e.g., 1 Kings 13:4). The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m!</FONT> is taken to mean, not "through," but "away from." Thus, Solomon was withdrawing his hand from the latch-opening, that is, he had given up and was leaving. This approach is adopted by NJPS: "My beloved took his hand off the latch." Solomon's departure is clearly stated in 5:6, "I opened [the door] for my beloved, but my beloved had already turned and gone away; my heart sank at his departure!" (see study notes below on 5:6).<br>
 <a name="fn182" href="sos.htm#fnB182"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn </b> (5:4) <i>Heb</i> "hole." Probably "latch-hole" or "key-hole," but possibly a euphemism (<i>double entendre</i>). The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rj)</FONT> ("hole") is used in OT in a literal and metaphorical sense: (1) literal sense: hole bored in the lid of a chest (2 Kgs 12:10); hole in a wall (Ezek 8:7); hole in the ground or cave used as hiding-places for men (1 Sam 13:6; 14:11; Isa 42:23); hole in the ground, as the dwelling place of an asp (Isa 11:8); and a hole in a mountain, as the den of lions (Nah 2:13); and (2) figurative sense: hole of an eye (metonomy of association), that is, eye-socket (Zech 14:12) (<i>HALOT </i>348; BDB 359). While the meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rj)</FONT> in Song 5:4 is clear--"hole"--there is a debate whether it is used in a literal or figurative sense. (1) Literal sense: The lexicons suggest that it denotes "hole of a door, that is, key-hole or latch-opening" (<i>HALOT </i>348; BDB 359). Most commentators suggest that it refers to a hole bored through the bedroom door to provide access to the latch or lock (Ginsburg, Gordis, Deere). The mention in 5:5 of "latches of the door-bolt" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lWun+M^h^ toPK^</FONT>) suggests that the term refers to some kind of opening associated with the latch of the bedroom door. This approach is followed by most translations: "the hole in the door" (JB), "the latch-hole" (NEB), "the latch-opening" (NIV), "the latch-hole" (NEB), "the latch" (RSV, NJPS), and "the opening of the door" (KJV). The assumption that the hole in question was a latch-hole in the door is reflected in Midrash Rabbah: Rabbi Abba ben Kahana said, "Why is the hole of the door mentioned here, seeing that it is a place where vermin swarm?" The situation envisaged by Solomon's actions are often depicted thus: In ancient Near Eastern villages, the bolting systems of doors utilized door-bolts and keys made of wood. The keys were often stored either on the outside (!) or inside of the door. If the key was placed on the inside of the door, a small hole was bored through the door so that a person could reach through the hole with the key to unlock the door. The key was often over a foot in length, and the keyhole large enough for a man's hand. Apparently, Solomon extended his hand through the hole from the outside to try to unbolt the door latch on the inside. He could put his hand through the hole, but could not open the door without the key. (2) Figurative sense: Because of the presence of several erotic motifs in 5:2-8 and the possibility that a <i>double entendre</i> is present (see notes below), several scholars suggest that the term is a euphemism for the female vagina (<i>HALOT </i>348). They suggest that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rj)</FONT> ("hole") is the female counterpart for the euphemistic usage of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dy&#180;</FONT> ("hand") in 5:4 (see A.S. Cook, <i>The Root of the Thing: A Study of Job and the Song of Songs</i> (Indiana University Press, 1968), 110, 123; Cheryl Exum, "A Literary and Structural Analysis of the Song of Songs," <i>ZAW</i> 85 (1973): 50-51; M.

 <a name="fn183" href="sos.htm#fnB183"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn </b> (5:4) <i>Heb</i> "my inward parts," "my intensities," or "my bowls." Alternately, "my feelings" or "my emotions." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hu#m@</FONT> is used of the internal organs in general ("inward parts") (e.g., 2 Sam 20:10; 2 Chr 21:15, 18; Pss 22:14; 40:9) or the digestive organs in particular ("intestines, bowls, stomach") (e.g., Num 5:22; Job 20:14; Ezek 3:3; 7:19; Jon 2:1-2). It is frequently used as a metonymy of adjunct for the emotions which Hebrew psychology associated with these internal organs (see H. W. Wolff, <i>Anthropology of the Old Testament</i> [Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1981], 63-66). These include pity (Isa 16:11), lamentation (Jer 48:36), distress (Jer 4:19; Lam 1:20; 2:11), and compassion (Isa 63:15; Jer 31:20) (<i>HALOT </i>610.3; BDB 589.5). Most scholars suggest that the Beloved's feelings of love were revived--a reversal of her feelings of indifference and apathy in 5:3. This is reflected in many translations which use equivalent English idioms: "the core of my being" (JB) and "my heart" (NIV, NJPS) over the woodenly literal "my bowels" (KJV, NEB, AV). On the other hand, the term is also used to refer the procreative organs, both male (e.g., Gen 15:4; 2 Sam 7:12; 16:11; Isa 48:19; 2 Chr 32:21) and female (e.g., Gen 25:23; Ruth 1:11; Ps 71:6; Isa 49:1). NASB well renders the line, "my feelings were aroused for him" (NASB).<br>
 <a name="fn184" href="sos.htm#fnB184"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn </b> (5:4) The exact meaning of this Hebrew verb is uncertain. The exact connotation of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wmh*</FONT> (Qal perfect 3cpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*h*</FONT>) in 5:4 is debated. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*h*</FONT> ("to murmur, growl, roar, be boisterous") is related to the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/omh*</FONT> ("sound, murmur, roar, noisy crowd"), <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hy&#180;m=h#</FONT> ("sound, music"), and perhaps even <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hl*m%h*</FONT> ("noise, noisy crowd, crowd"). The Hebrew root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmh</FONT> is related to Aramaic <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">amh</FONT> ("to roar; to be agitated"). The Hebrew verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*h* </FONT>has a basic two-fold range of meanings: (1) literal: "to make a noise" of some kind and (2) figurative: "to be in commotion, uproar" (e.g., often associated with noise or a noisy crowd). The lexicons suggest six distinct categories: (1) "to make a noise" or "to be in commotion," particularly by a tumultuous crowd (1 Kgs 1:41; Pss 39:7; 46:7; Prov 1:21; Is 22:2; Mic 2:12); (2) "to roar," of the sea and sea-waves (Isa 17:12; 51:15; Jer 5:22; 6:23; 31:35; 50:42; 51:55; Ps 46:4); (3) "to make a sound," e.g., bear growling (Isa 59:11), dog barking (Ps 59:7, 15), bird chirping (Ps 102:8), dove cooing (Ezek 7:16); (4) "to moan," (Ps 39:7; 55:18; Prov 1:21; Lam 2:18; Ezek 7:16; Zech 9:15); (5) "to be turbulent, boisterous" (Prov 7:11; 9:13; 20:1; Zech 9:5); and (6) figuratively of the internal organs: "to murmur, be restless, be turbulent," used in reference to pity (Isa 16:11; Jer 4:19; 31:20; 48:36), discouragement (Ps 42:6, 12; 43:5), and murmuring in prayer (Pss 55:18; 77:4) (<i>HALOT </i>250; BDB 242). HALOT suggests "to be turbulent" for Song 5:4 (<i>HALOT </i>250.4), while BDB suggests "the thrill of deep-felt compassion or sympathy" (BDB 242.2). Commentators offer a spectrum of opinions from the Beloved feeling agitation, pity, and compassion, sexual arousal, or a revival of her love for him. A survey of the translations reveals the same lack of consensus: "my bowels were moved for him" (KJV), "my bowels stirred within me" (NEB), "my heart yearned for him" (AT), "my heart was thrilled within me" (RSV), "I trembled to the core of my being" (JB), "my heart trembled within me" (NAB), "my heart was stirred for him" (JPS, NJPS), "my feelings were aroused for him" (NASB), and "my heart began to pound for him" (NIV). While the precise meaning may never be agreed upon, whatever she was feeling roused herself from her indifferent apathetic inactivity to arise and open for her beloved in 5:5. The phrase is used similarly elsewhere in OT, rousing the subject to irresistible action (Jer 4:19). The simplest course of action is to nuance this term metonymically (cause for effect), e.g., "my feelings were stirred up for him."<br>
 <a name="fn185" href="sos.htm#fnB185"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn </b> (5:6) The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qm^j*</FONT> occurs only in Song 5:6 (Qal: "to turn away, go leave") and in Jer 31:22 (Hitpael: "to turn hither and thither") (<i>HALOT </i>330; BDB 330). It is related to the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qWmj*</FONT> ("curve, curved lines" of a woman's hips) which only appears in Song 7:2 (<i>HALOT </i>327; BDB 330). This root does not appear in Mishnaic Hebrew nor has it yet been attested in any cognate language. However, it was understood in this sense by LXX <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">parh'lqen </FONT>("he turned aside"), and also handled in a similar manner in Aquila, Symmachus, Peshitta, and Vulgate.<br>
 <a name="fn186" href="sos.htm#fnB186"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn </b> (5:6) The verbs <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rb*u*</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qm^j*</FONT> ("he turned away, he went away") may form a verbal hendiadys. Normally, the first verb will function as an adverb modifying the second which functions in its full verbal sense. Each functions as a perfect of recent past perfect action, describing a past event that took place shortly before another past event: "I opened [past action] for my beloved, but my lover had already turned and gone away [past perfect action]."<br>
 <a name="fn187" href="sos.htm#fnB187"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn </b> (5:6) <i>Heb</i> "my soul went out." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yv!p=n~</FONT> ("my soul") is a synecdoche of part for the whole person. The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp#n\</FONT> ("soul") is used over 150 times as a metonymy of association with feelings: sorrow and distress, joy, love, desire, passion, hatred, loathing, avarice (<i>HALOT </i>713.8; BDB 660.6). The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ha*x=y&#180; yv!p=n~</FONT> (literally, "my soul went out") is a Hebrew idiom connoting great despair (e.g., Gen. 35:18; Jer. 15:9). The phrase is well rendered by NIV: "my heart sank at his departure." Verses 6-7 clearly indicate that the Beloved fell into despair when Solomon had departed: she searched desperately for him, but could not find him; she called for him, but he did not answer.<br>
 <a name="fn188" href="sos.htm#fnB188"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn </b> (5:6) Alternately, "spoke." Traditionally, the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">orB=d^b= </FONT>(Piel infinitive construct from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rb^D*</FONT> + 3ms suffix + <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">b=</FONT> preposition) has been related to the common root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rb^D*</FONT> II ("to speak") which occurs nearly 1150 times in verbal forms and nearly 1500 times as a noun. This approach is seen as early as the LXX (although the LXX treated <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rb*D*</FONT> as a noun rather than an infinitive construct because it was working with an unpointed text): <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn logw'/ aujtou' </FONT>("in his word"). Although they differ on whether the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">b=</FONT> is temporal ("when") or respect ("at"), many translations adopt the same basic approach as the LXX: "when he spake" (KJV), "as he spoke" (NASB), "when he spoke" (NIV margin), "at what he said" (JPS, NJPS). However, many recent scholars relate <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">orB=d^b=</FONT> to the homonymic root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rb^D*</FONT> I ("to turn away, depart") which is related to Akkadian <i>dabaru</i> D "to go away," Dt "to drive away, push back" (<i>CAD</i> 3:186ff), and Arabic <i>dabara</i> "to turn one's back, be behind, depart, retreat" (<i>HALOT </i>209). Several examples of this root have been found (Pss 18:48; 47:4; 56:6; 75:6; 116:10; 127:5; 2 Chr 22:10; Job 19:18; Song 5:6; Isa 32:7) (<i>HALOT </i>209-10). Several recent translations take this approach: "when he turned his back" (NEB), "at his flight" (JB), and "at his departure" (NIV). This makes better sense contextually (Solomon did not say anything after 5:2a), and it provides a tighter parallelism with the preceding line that also describes his departure: "My beloved had turned away (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qm^j*</FONT>); he was gone (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rb^u*</FONT>)" (NIV).<br>
 <a name="fn189" href="sos.htm#fnB189"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn </b> (5:8) The genitive construct <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb*h&amp;a^ tl^oj</FONT> ("sick of love") denotes "lovesick." This is an example of a genitive of cause, that is, the Beloved was (physically/emotionally) sick because of her unrequited love for Solomon. See study note on Song 2:5.<br>
 <a name="fn190" href="sos.htm#fnB190"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn </b> (5:9) <i>Heb</i> "How is your beloved [better] than [another] lover?"<br>
 <a name="fn191" href="sos.htm#fnB191"><sup>21</sup></a><b>sn </b> (5:10) The Beloved's praise of Solomon's appearance follows the typical literary structure of the ancient Near Eastern <i>wasfs</i> song: (1) introductory summary praise (5:10), (2) detailed descriptive praise from head to foot (5:11-16a), and (3) concluding summary praise (5:16b). There are several striking features about this song that is unique from the typical <i>wasfs</i>. (1) The ordinary setting of the ancient Near Eastern <i>wasfs</i> songs was the wedding night. (2) They were ordinarily sung only by a man in praise of his bride. (3) Normally, the wasfs song will conclude with the feet after the legs; however, the Beloved concludes by praising his mouth after his legs.<br>
 <a name="fn192" href="sos.htm#fnB192"><sup>22</sup></a><b>sn </b> (5:10) The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jx^</FONT> ("dazzling") is ordinarily used to describe the shining surface of jewelry or of smoothed rocks (Ezek. 24:7-8; 26:4, 14; Neh. 4:7). Likewise, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;d)a* </FONT>("ruddy") can describe the redness of rubies (Lam 4:7). Throughout 5:11-15 she compares Solomon's appearance to valuable jewels, gems, and precious metals.<br>
 <a name="fn193" href="sos.htm#fnB193"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:10)  The adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;d)a*</FONT> denotes either "manly" or "ruddy," depending upon whether it is derived from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;d*a*</FONT> I ("man") or <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;d)a*</FONT> II ("red"). If it is "manly," the idea is that he is the epitome of masculinity and virility. On the other hand, the emphasis would be upon his health and virility, evidenced by his ruddy complexion, or it could be a comparison between his ruddy coloring and the redness of rubies (Lam. 4:7).<br>
 <a name="fn194" href="sos.htm#fnB194"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn </b> (5:10) <i>Heb</i> "outstanding." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lWgD* </FONT>(Qal passive participle ms from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lg^D*</FONT>) functions as a predicate adjective: "My beloved is...outstanding among ten thousand." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lg^D* </FONT>is relatively rare, being derived from the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lg#D#</FONT> ("banner") which often refers to a military standard which, when lifted up, was conspicuous for all to see (Num. 2:3-4; 10:14-15). The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lg^D*</FONT> only occurs three other times, all referring to raising military banners for all to see (Ps 20:6; Song 6:4, 10). Song 5:10 uses the term figuratively (hypocatastasis) to denote "outstanding" (<i>HALOT </i>213). This sense is closely related to the cognate Akkadian verb <i>dagalu</i> "to look, contemplate" and the noun <i>diglu</i> "eyesight, view (what is looked at)." Like a banner lifted high, he attracted the attention of all who looked at him.<br>
 <a name="fn195" href="sos.htm#fnB195"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn </b> (5:10) <i>Heb</i> "among." The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m!</FONT> prefixed to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb*b*r+</FONT> ("ten thousand") is taken in a locative sense: "outstanding among ten thousand" (e.g., KJV, RSV, NASB, NIV, NJPS). <br>
 <a name="fn196" href="sos.htm#fnB196"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn </b> (5:10) <i>Heb</i> "among ten thousand." The numeral "ten thousand" is the highest number used in comparisons in Hebrew poetry (1 Sam. 18:7-8; 21:12; 29:5; Ps. 91:7). It is not used to mark out a specific number, but to denote an indefinite number of persons of the largest possible proportions (Gen 24:60; Num 10:36; Deut 33:2; Ps 3:7). Her point is simply this: no other man could possibly compare to Solomon in appearance, even if he were in a group of an infinite number of men.<br>
 <a name="fn197" href="sos.htm#fnB197"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn </b> (5:11) <i>Heb</i> "his head is gold of pure gold." In the genitive construct phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">zP* &lt;t#K# </FONT>(literally, "gold of pure gold") the genitive noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">zP*</FONT> ("pure gold") functions as an adjectival genitive modifying <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;t#K#</FONT> ("gold"), that is, "pure gold." The repetition of two different words for "gold" suggest that the phrase should be nuanced "the most pure gold." This phrase is a predicate nominate in a metaphorical statement: "his head is (like) the most pure gold." In the OT gold is frequently used in comparisons to emphasize the idea of beauty, value, or rarity (Job 28:12-19; Pss. 19:11; 119:127; Prov. 8:19; Isa. 13:12; Lam. 4:2). Palestine had no known sources of gold, but had to import it, making it a rare and precious commodity (Ruth V. Wright and R. L. Chadbourne, <i>The Gems and Minerals of the Bible</i> [New York: Harper and Row, 1970], 65). In an Egyptian love song the comparison with gold is also used to emphasize the beauty and value of the appearance of the Beloved, "Her arm surpasses gold." See A. A. Gardiner, <i>A Description of a Hieratic Papyrus with a Mythological Story, Love Songs, and Other Miscellaneous Texts</i> (London: Emery Walker, 1931), 30.<br>
 <a name="fn198" href="sos.htm#fnB198"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn </b> (5:11) Literally "his locks [of hair] are curls." The Hebrew adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lT*l=T^</FONT> is a <i>hapax</i> <i>legomenon</i> whose meaning is somewhat unclear. BDB suggests that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lT*l=T^ </FONT>is from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">llT</FONT> I "mound, heap" (BDB 1068) which is related to Arabic <i>tl</i> "mound, hill, top" (Lane, <i>Arabic-English Dictionary, </i>311) and Akkadian <i>tilu</i> "hill, mound" (<i>AHw</i> 3:1358). On the other hand, <i>HALOT</i> suggests that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lT*l=T^</FONT> means "date-panicle" and that it is related to the Akkadian noun <i>taltallu</i> "pollen of date-panicle" (<i>HALOT</i> 1031). The term occurs in Mishnaic Hebrew as <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lT*l=T^</FONT> "curls, locks" (Jastrow, 1674b). It is used in the same way in the Song. The form <i>tltl</i> is a reduplicated pattern used for adjectives denoting an intense characteristic (Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Biblical Hebrew Grammar</i>, 5.5; Moscati, <i>Comparative Semitic Grammar</i>, 12, 9-13). It functions as a predicate adjective to the subjective nominative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wyt*oxWq</FONT> ("his locks of hair").<br>

The balsam trees should be identified either as <i>Astragalus</i> <i>tragacantha</i> which grew everywhere in Palestine and exude resin from its thorns, or as <i>Commiphora opobalsamum</i> which was not native to Israel but of South Arabia from whence it had to be imported at great cost (2 Chr 9:1).

The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lD*g=m!</FONT> "tower" is normally used in reference to (1) watch-towers, defended towers along the city wall, and individual towers in the countryside to protect the borders, (2) storehouses, and (3) tower in a vineyard (<i>HALOT </i>543-44). It is never used in OT in association with a flower garden. On the other hand, LXX reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">fuousai</FONT> ("yielding") which reflects an alternate vocalization tradition of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tolD=g^m=</FONT> (Piel participle fpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ld^G*</FONT> I "to increase, produce"). This makes good sense contextually because the Piel stem of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ld^G*</FONT> I means "to grow" plants and trees (Isa 44:14; Ezek 31:4; Jon 4:10) (<i>HALOT </i>179.2). This revocalization is suggested by <i>BHS</i> editors, as well as the Hebrew lexicographers (<i>HALOT </i>544.2; 1:179.2; BDB 152.1). Several translations follow LXX and revocalize the text (RSV, NIV, NJPS margin): "His cheeks are like beds of spice yielding perfume" (NIV) and "His cheeks are like beds of spice producing perfume" (NJPS margin). The other translations struggle to make sense of the MT, but are forced to abandon a literal rendering of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tolD=g+m!</FONT> ("towers"): "banks sweet herbs" (ASV), "banks sweetly scented" (JB), "treasure-chambers full of perfume" (NEB), "banks of sweet scented herbs" (NASB), and "banks of perfume" (JPS, NJPS). <br>

There is only one usage in which it might refer to a real garden (8:13). Thus, this usage of "garden" might be figuratively or literal. Options: (1) Solomon went to a real garden for repose. Solomon did, in fact, own a great many gardens (Eccl 2:4-7; 1 Chr 27:27). (2) The "garden" is a figurative description referring either to: (a) the young woman, (b) their sexual love, or (c) Solomon's harem.<br>

Thus, the two options are: (1) the term refers to a real flower-bed of balsam to which Solomon had gone or (2) this term is a figure for sexual love.<br>
 <a name="fn208" href="sos.htm#fnB208"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn </b> (6:2) The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tour+l!</FONT> ("to browse" NIV) is from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hu*r&#180;</FONT> ("to feed, graze") which is used seven times in the Song (1:7, 8a, 8b; 2:16; 4:5; 6:2, 3). All its uses appear to be either literal or figurative descriptions of sheep grazing. The verb is used twice in reference to sheep "grazing" in a pasture (1:7, 8). The participle is used once to designate "shepherds" (1:8), once in reference to two fawns which "which browse among the lilies" as a figurative description of her breasts (4:5), and twice as a figurative description of Solomon as "the one who browses among the lilies" which is probably also a comparison of Solomon to a grazing sheep (2:16; 6:3). Therefore, it is likely that the usage of the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tour+l! </FONT>("to browse") in 6:2 is also a figurative comparison of Solomon to a sheep grazing among garden flowers. Thus, there are two options: (1) nuance the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tour+l!</FONT> as "to browse" and take this as a literal action of Solomon walking through a real garden or (2) nuance the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tour+l!</FONT> as "to graze" and take this as a figure in which Solomon is pictured as a gazelle grazing on the flowers in a garden.<br>
 <a name="fn209" href="sos.htm#fnB209"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn </b> (6:2) The term "lily" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hN&#180;v^ov</FONT>) or "lilies" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yn]v^ov</FONT>) appears eight times in the Song (2:1, 2, 16; 4:5; 5:13; 6:2, 3; 7:2). Of these five are unequivocally used figuratively as descriptions of a woman or women (2:1, 2), the color and softness of her breasts (4:5), the attractiveness of Solomon's lips (5:13), and her waist (7:2). The closest parallel to 6:2 is the description "the one who grazes among the lilies" (2:16; 6:3) which is a figurative expression comparing Solomon's romancing of his Beloved with a sheep feeding on lilies. However, this still leaves a question as to what the lilies represent in 2:16; 6:2, 3. The phrase "to gather lilies" itself appears only here in the Song. However, the synonymous phrase "to gather myrrh and balsam spice" is used in 5:1 as a figure (euphemistic hypocatastasis) for sexual consummation by the man of the woman. There are three basic options as to how "lilies" may be taken: (1) The lilies are real flowers; Solomon has gone to a real garden in which to repose and she is picking real lilies. (2) The term "lilies" is a figure for the young woman; Solomon is romancing her just as he had in 2:16 and 5:1. Solomon is kissing her mouth just as a sheep would graze among lilies. (3) The term "lilies" is a figure expression referring to other women, such as his harem (e.g., 6:8-9). Several factors support the "harem" interpretation: (1) Solomon had recently departed from her, and she was desperate to find him after she refused him. (2) Solomon's harem is mentioned explicitly in 6:8-9. However, several other factors support the Beloved interpretation: (1) She expresses her confidence in 6:3 that Solomon is devoted to her. (2) The immediately following use of "lilies" in 6:3 appears to refer to her, as in 2:16 and 5:1. (3) Solomon praises her in 6:4-7, suggesting that he was romancing her in 6:2-3. (4) Although Solomon's harem is mentioned in 6:8-10, all these women acknowledge that Solomon is disinterested in them and only loves her. (5) Her's exultation "I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine; the one who browses among the lilies" (6:3) is a statement of assurance in their relationship and this would seem quite strange if Solomon was cavorting with his harem while she said this.<br>

The significance of this shift depends on whether the parallelism is synonymous or climactic. This might merely be a literary variation with no rhetorical significance. On the other hand, it might signal a shift in her view of their relationship: Originally, she focused on her possession of him, now she focused on his possession of her.<br>

So beautiful was Tirzah that it would be chosen by Jeroboam as the original capital of the northern kingdom (1 Kings 15:33; 16:8, 15, 23). The ancient city Tirzah has been identified as Tel el-Far&#180;ah near Nablus: B. S. J.

This use of the term "maidens" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toml*u&amp;</FONT>) refers to the young women of Solomon's harem, possibly virgins and not yet concubines.

While the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*l=u^</FONT> ("maiden") may be used in reference to a young woman who is a virgin, the term itself does not explicitly denote "virgin." The Hebrew term which explicitly denotes "virgin" is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hl*WtB=</FONT> which refers to a mature young woman without any sexual experience with men (e.g., Gen 24:16; Exod 22:15-16; Lev 21:3; Deut 22:23, 28; 32:25; Judg 12:12; 19:24; 2 Sam 13:2, 18; 1 Kgs 1:2; 2 Chr 36:17; Esth 2:2-3, 17, 19; Job 31:1; Pss 45:15; 78:63; 148:12; Isa 23:4; 62:5; Jer 2:32; 31:3; 51:22; Lam 1:4, 18; 2:10, 21; 5:11; Ezek 9:6; Joel 1:8; Amos 9:13; Zech 9:17 (<i>HALOT </i>167; BDB 143d).

Delitzsch renders <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hp*q*v=N]h^ </FONT>as "who rises," while NIV opts for "who appears." The verb means "to look down upon [something] from a height" and is derived from the related noun "ceiling, roof, sky" (BDB 1054; <i>HALOT</i> 1009). The verb is used of looking down over a plain or valley from the vantage point of a mountain-top (Num 21:20; 23:28; 1 Sam 13:18); of God looking down from heaven (Ps 14:2); or of a person looking down below out of an upper window (Judg 5:28; 2 Sam 6:16; Prov 7:6). Pope suggests that this verb implies the idea of her superiority over the other women (M. H. Pope, The Song of Songs, AB7C (Garden City: Doubleday &amp; Co., 1977), pp. 571-72). That is, she occupies a "higher" position over them due to Solomon's choice of her. Carr questions whether such an intimation is actually present. The verb creates personification (i.e., the dawn is attributed with the human action of looking). Just as the dawn is the focus of attention during the morning hours and looks down upon the earth, so too she is the focus of Solomon's attention and is in the privileged position over all the other women.<br>

All other celestial objects pale into insignificance in their presence. This would be an appropriate description of her because she alone was the center and focus of Solomon's attention. All the other women paled into the background when she was present. Her beauty captured the attention of all that saw her, especially Solomon.<br>

Both of these terms, "the white one" and "the hot one," are metonymies of adjunct in which an attribute (i.e., color and heat) are substituted for the subject itself. The white moon in contrast to the dark night sky captures one's attention, just as the red-hot sun in the afternoon sky is the center of attention during the day. The use of the figurative comparisons of her beauty to that of the dawn, sun, moon, and stars is strikingly similar to the Hebrews' figurative comparison of Simon the high priest coming out of the sanctuary to the morning star, moon, sun, and rainbow: "How glorious he was when the people gathered round him as he came out of the inner sanctuary! Like the morning star among the clouds, like the moon when it is full; like the sun shining upon the temple of the Most High, and like the rainbow gleaming in glorious clouds" (See G.

The difficulty of this verse has generated a plethora of different translations: "Or ever I was aware, my soul made me [like] the chariots of Ammi-nadib" (KJV), "Before I knew it, my soul made me like the chariots of Ammi-nadib" (AV), "Before I knew it, my fancy set me in a chariot beside my prince" (AT), "Before I knew...my desire hurled me on the chariots of my people, as their prince" (JB), "Before I knew it, my desire set me mid the chariots of Ammi-nadib" (JPSV), "I did not know myself, she made me feel more than a prince reigning over the myriads of his people" (NEB), "Before I knew it, my heart had made me the blessed one of my kins-women" (NAB), "Before I was aware, my soul set me [over] the chariots of my noble people" (NASB), "Before I realized it, my desire set me among the royal chariots of my people" (NIV), "...among the chariots of Amminadab" (NIV margin), "...among the chariots of the people of the prince" (NIV margin), and "Before I realized it, I was stricken with a terrible homesickness and wanted to be back among my own people" (NLT).

S.

The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tym!l^WVh^</FONT> has been variously translated: "Shulammite maiden" (NEB); "maiden of Shulam" (JB); "O maid of Shulem" (NJPS); "the Shulammite" (KJV; NASB; NIV). The meaning of the name <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tym!l^WVh^</FONT> is enigmatic and debated. LXX renders it <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJ Soulamitij</FONT> ("O Shulamite") and Vulgate renders it <i>Sulamitis</i> ("O Shulamite"). A few Hebrew MSS read the plural <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toml^WVh^</FONT> but the Masoretic tradition reads <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tym!l^WVh^</FONT> as the versions confirm. Eight major views have emerged in the history of interpretation of the Song. They are arranged, as follows, in order from most likely (views 1-2), plausible (views 3-5), unlikely (view 6), to bizarre (views 7-8): (1) <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tym!l^Wv</FONT> is a substantival use of the adjectival form qutal <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;l*Wv</FONT> ("perfection") with the Gentilic suffix <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ty</FONT>- from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;l@v*</FONT> ("to be complete, perfect"): "the perfect, unblemished one" (Fox). This approach is reflected in rabbinic exegesis of the 12th century: "The meaning of the Shulammite is `perfect, without spot'" (Midrash Rabbah). (2) <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tym!l^Wv</FONT> is Qal passive participle with the feminine adjectival suffix <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ty</FONT>- from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;l@v* </FONT>("peace"): "the peaceful one" or "the pacified one" (Andr, Robert, Jo&uuml;on). This is reflected in Vulgate <i>pacificus</i> ("the pacified one"), and Aquila and Quinta <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJ ejhruneouvsa</FONT> "the peaceful one" (Andre Robert, Jo&uuml;on). (3) <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tym!l^Wv</FONT> is alternate form of the Gentilic name "Shunammite" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tym!n~Wv</FONT>) used to refer to inhabitants of Shunem (1 Kgs 1:15; 2 Kgs 4:12). This is reflected in LXX <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJ Soulamitij</FONT> ("O Shunamite"). This is supported by several factors: (a) Gentilic names are formed by the suffix <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ty</FONT>- and the prefixed article to a place-name, e.g., <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tym!l^v*WrY+h^</FONT> ("the Jerusalemite") is from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;]l^v*Wry+ </FONT>("Jerusalem"); (b) the interchange between lateral dental <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l</FONT> (<i>l</i>) and nasal dental <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">n</FONT> (<i>n</i>) is common in the Semitic languages (Sabatino Moscati, <i>Comparative Semitic Grammar</i>, &#167;8.26); (c) the town of Shunem was also known as Shulem, due to the common interchange between <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">n</FONT> (<i>n</i>) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l</FONT> (<i>l</i>) in Hebrew (Aharoni, 123), as seen in Eusebius's Onomasticon in which Shunem = Shulem; and (d) later revisions of the LXX read <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJ Sounamwtij</FONT> ("the Shunamite") instead of the Old Greek <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJ Soulamwtij</FONT> ("the Shulamite"). Shunem was a town in the Jezreel Valley at the foot of Mount Moreh near Mount Tabor and situated about nine miles east of Megiddo, fifteen miles northwest of Beth-shean, and five miles north of Jezreel (Josh 19:18; 1 Sam 28:4; 2 Kgs 4:8). During the Roman period, the town was called Shulem. See Y. Aharoni, <i>The Land of the Bible: A Historical Geography</i> (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1979), 24, 152, 172, 442, 308. Some scholars suggest that "Shul/nammite" refers to Abishag, the beautiful virgin from the village of Shunem who warmed elderly King David and was sought by Adonijah (1 Kgs 2:13- 25). Other scholars argue that Abishag has been imported in the Song on too slender grounds. (4) <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tym!l^Wv</FONT> is the feminine form of the masculine name <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm)Ov=</FONT> ("Solomon"), just as Judith is the feminine of Judah: "Shulamith" or "Solomonette" or "Solomoness" (Lowth, Goodspeed, Rowley). The feminine ending <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ty-</FONT> may be suffixed to masculine personal names to transform them into feminine names. A similar form occurs in the Ugaritic designation of Daniel's wife as Lady Daniel (e.g., <i>mtt dnty</i>). An anonymous Jewish commentator of the 12th century wrote: "The Shulammite was beloved of Solomon, for she was called after the name of her beloved." The 16th century commentator Joseph Ibn Yahya wrote: "And the calling of her `Shulammite' was determined by reason of her devotion to the Holy One (Blessed be He) who is called Shelomoh." (5) As a combination of views 1-2, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tym!l^Wv</FONT> is a wordplay formed by the combination of the feminine name <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tym!Ov=</FONT> ("Shelomite") from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm)Ov=</FONT> ("Solomon") and the Gentilic name <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tym!n~WVh^</FONT> ("the Shunammite") denoting a woman from Shunem: "Solomoness/Shunammite." (6) <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tym!l^Wv</FONT> is related to the Arabic root <i>salama</i> "consummation gift" (given to a bride the morning after the wedding): "O Consummated One" or "O Bride" (Hirschberg). (7) Those espousing a cultic interpretation of Canticles take <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tym!l^Wv</FONT> as the name or epithet of the Canaanite moon goddess Ishtar, designated by the feminine form of the name Shelem, the name of her lover Tammuz, called Dod or Shelem (T. J. Meek). (8) An alternate cultic interpretation takes <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tym!l^Wv</FONT> as a conflation of the name of the Assyrian war-goddess "Shulmanith" (Ishtar) and the Gentilic name "the Shunammite" for a woman from Shunem (Albright).

The first usage is usually restricted to a figure for the male loins, the source of male procreation (Gen 46:26; Exod 1:5) and the locus of an oath (Gen 24:2, 9; 47:29).<br>
 <a name="fn248" href="sos.htm#fnB248"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn </b> (7:2) The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rr\v)</FONT> is a <i>hapax legomenon</i>, appearing in the OT only here. There is debate whether it means "navel" or "vulva": (1) Lys and Pope suggest that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rr\v)</FONT> is related to Arabic <i>srr</i> ("secret place, pudenda, coition, fornication"). They suggest that this is contextually supported by three factors: (a) Solomon's descriptive praise of her is in ascending order, beginning with her feet and concluding with her hair. The movement from her thighs (7:1b), to her vulva (7:2a), and then to her waist (7:2b) would fit this. (b) The descriptive comparison to a glass of wine would be grotesque if her navel were in view--her navel was moist or filled with liquid?--but appropriate if her vulva were in view. (c) The navel would be a somewhat synonymous reference to the belly which is already denoted by <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">En}f=B!</FONT> ("belly") in the following line. Because 7:1-7 does not use synonymous parallelism, the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rr\v)</FONT> would have to refer to something other than the belly. (2) The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rr\v)</FONT> denotes "navel": (a) It may be related to the bi-consonantal noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rv)</FONT> ("navel, umbilical cord") (Prov 3:8; Ezek 16:4). (b) Mishnaic Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rr&#180;v*</FONT> denotes "navel, umbilical cord" (Jastrow, 1634). For example, in a midrash on the Book of Numbers, the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rr\v)</FONT> appears in an allusion to Song 7:3 to justify the seating of the Sanhedrin in the middle of the synagogue: "As the navel (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rr\v)</FONT>) is placed in the centre of the body, so are the Sanhedrin..." (<i>Num. Rab.</i> 1:4). On the other hand, the meaning "vulva" never appears in Mishnaic Hebrew. Therefore, apart from this disputed usage there is no evidence that this term was ever used in this manner in Hebrew. (c) Rather than being related <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rr\v)</FONT> to Arabic <i>sirr</i> ("pudenda"), it could just as easily be related to the Arabic noun <i>surr</i> "navel." It is methodologically more sound to define <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rr\v)</FONT> as "navel" than as "vulva." (d) The nuance "navel" is not as out of line contextually as Lys and Pope suggest. The navel would not be out of place in the ascending order of praise because the "abdomen" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">En}f=B!</FONT>) which follows may be viewed as both above and below the navel. The figurative association of the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rr\v)</FONT> as a mixing bowl filled with wine does not imply that this bodily part must actually be moist or filled with liquid as Pope suggests. The point of comparison is not physical or visual but one of function, i.e., it is intoxicating. The comparison of the navel to a mixing bowl of wine is no more out of line than the comparison of the belly to a heap of wheat in the next line. In fact, the two go together--she is both the "drink" and "food" for Solomon. The shape of the navel is as congruent with the metaphor of the "round bowl" than the vulva; both are round and receding. (3) Since both terms are derived from the same geminate root--Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rr\v)</FONT> and Arabic <i>srr</i>--it is more prudent to take the term as a synecdoche of whole (lower region) for the parts (including navel and vulva). The attempt to decide between these two options may be illegitimately splitting hairs. Selected Bibliography: F. Delitzsch, K&amp;D, 123; J. S. Deere, 199-200; D.

The comparison of her navel to a "round mixing bowl" is visually appropriate in that both are round and receding. The primary point of comparison to the round bowl is one of sense, as the following clause makes clear: "which never lacks mixed wine." Deere suggests that the point of comparison is that of taste, desirability, and function (J. S. Deere, ibid., 202). More specifically, it probably refers to the source of intoxication, that is, just as a bowl used to mix wine was the source of physical intoxication, so she was the source of Solomon's sexual intoxication. She intoxicated Solomon with her love in the same way that wine intoxicates a person.<br>

However, the negative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la^</FONT> normally precedes a jussive expressing a wish or request: "May it never lack mixed wine!" (Deere, 202).

 <a name="fn251" href="sos.htm#fnB251"><sup>8</sup></a><b>sn </b> (7:2) The term "mixed wine" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gz#m*</FONT>) does not refer to wine mixed with water to water-down its potency, but to strong wine mixed with weaker wine. The practice of mixing wine with water is not attested in the Hebrew Bible. Both <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gz#m*</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Es#m#</FONT> refer to strong wine mixed with weaker wine. The rabbis later distinguished between the two, stating that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gz#m*</FONT> was strong wine mixed with weak wine, while <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Es#m#</FONT> was wine mixed with water (Aboda Zara 58b). However, both types of wine were intoxicating. Mixed wine was the most intoxicating type of wine. In a midrash on the Book of Numbers a comment is made about the practice of mixing strong wine with weaker wine (e.g., Isa 5:22; Prov. 23:30), stating its purpose: "They used to mix strong wine with weak wine so as to get drunk with it" (<i>Num. Rab.</i> 10:8). Selected Bibliography: J. P. Brown, "The Mediterranean Vocabulary of Wine," <i>VT</i> 19 (1969): 154. The comparison of a wife's sexual love to intoxicating wine is common in ancient Near Eastern love literature. Parallel in thought is the words of the Hebrew sage, "May your fountain be blessed and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth. A loving doe, a graceful deer--may her breasts always intoxicate you, may you ever stagger like a drunkard in her love" (Prov 5:18-19).<br>
 <a name="fn252" href="sos.htm#fnB252"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn </b> (7:2) Alternately, "your waist." The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">En}f=B!</FONT> probably refers to the woman's "belly" rather than "waist." It is associated with a woman's abdominal/stomach region rather than her hips (Prov 13:25; 18:20; Ezek 3:3). The comparison of her belly to a heap of wheat is visually appropriate because of the similarity of their symmetrical shape and tannish color. The primary point of comparison, however, is based upon the commonplace association of wheat in Israel, namely, wheat was the main staple of the typical Israelite meal (Deut 32:14; 2 Sam 4:6; 17:28; 1 Kgs 5:25; Pss 81:14; 147:14). Just as wheat satisfied an Israelite's physical hunger, she satisfied Solomon's sexual hunger. Deere makes this point in the following manner: "The most obvious commonplace of wheat was its function, that is, it served as one of the main food sources in ancient Palestine. The Beloved was both the "food" (wheat) and "drink" (wine) of the Lover. Her physical expression of love nourished and satisfied him. His satisfaction was great for the "mixed wine" is intoxicating and the "heap of wheat" was capable of feeding many. The "heap of wheat" also suggests the harvest, an association which contributes to the emotional quality of the metaphor. The harvest was accompanied with a joyous celebration over the bounty yielded up by the land. So also, the Beloved is bountiful and submissive in giving of herself, and the source of great joy" (J. S. Deere, 203-204).<br>

The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/V@h^</FONT> ("ivory") is a genitive of composition, that is, a tower made out of ivory. Solomon had previously compared her neck to a tower (Song 4:4). In both cases the most obvious point of comparison has to do with size and shape, that is, her neck was long and symmetrical. Archaeology has never found a tower overlaid with ivory in the ancient Near East and it is doubtful that there ever was an actual tower overlaid with ivory. The point of comparison might simply be that the shape of her neck looks like a tower, while the color and smoothness of her neck was like ivory. Solomon is mixing metaphors: her neck was long and symmetrical like a tower; but also elegant, smooth, and beautiful as ivory. The beauty, elegance, and smoothness of a woman's neck is commonly compared to ivory in ancient love literature. For example, in a piece of Greek love literature, Anacron compared the beauty of the neck of his beloved Bathyllus to ivory (Ode xxxix 28-29).<br>

The mountain range borders the southern edge of the plain of Esdraelon, dividing the Palestinian coastal plain into the Plain of Acco to the north and the Plains of Sharon and Philistia to the south. Its luxuriant foliage was legendary (Isa 33;9; Amos 1:2; Nah 1:4). Rising to a height of approximately 1750 feet (525 m), it extends southeast from the Mediterranean for 13 miles (21 km). Due to its greatness and fertility, it was often associated with majesty and power (Isa 35:2; Jer 46:18). The point of the comparison is that her head crowns her body just as the majestic Mount Carmel rested over the landscape, rising above it in majestic and fertile beauty. Selected Bibliography: W. H.

It is used in reference to purple threads (Exod 35:25; 39:3; Esth 1:9) or purple cloth (Num 4:13; Judg 8:26; Esth 8:15; Prov 31:22; Jer 10:9; Song 3:10). NASB translates it as "purple threads," while NIV nuances this term as "royal tapestry." Pope adduces several ancient Near Eastern texts and suggests that it refers to purple hair-dye (Pope, 629-30). The comparison is between hair which entangles Solomon like binding cords and therefore, it seems most likely that the idea here must be purple threads. The Hebrew noun is a loanword from Hittite <i>argaman</i> "tribute," which is reflected in Akkadian <i>argamannu</i> "purple" (also "tribute" under Hittite influence), Ugaritic <i>argmn</i> "tax, purple," Aramaic <i>argwn</i> "purple" (<i>HALOT </i>84). Purple cloth and threads were considered very valuable (Ezek 27:7, 16) and were commonly worn by kings as a mark of their royal position (Judg 8:26).<br>
 <a name="fn260" href="sos.htm#fnB260"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn </b> (7:5) Alternately, "captivated."

It is frequently used as a figure to depict absolute authority over a person (Ps 105:22). The passive participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rWs</FONT>) means "to be bound, held captive, imprisoned" (2 Sam 3:34; Jer 40:1; Job 36:8). Like a prisoner bond in cords and fetters and held under the complete control and authority of his captor, Solomon was captivated by the spellbinding power of her hair. In a word, he was the prisoner of love and she was his captor. Similar imagery appears in an ancient Egyptian love song: "With her hair she throws lassoes at me, with her eyes she catches me, with her necklace she entangles me, and with her seal ring she brands me" (Song 43 in the Chester Beatty Cycle, translated by W. K. Simpson, <i>The Literature of Ancient Egypt</i> [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972], 324). Deere suggests, "The concluding part of the metaphor, `The king is held captive by your tresses,' is a beautiful expression of the powerful effect of love. A strong monarch was held prisoner by the beauty of his Beloved" (J. S. Deere, 206-207). This is a startling statement because Solomon emphasizes that the one who was being held captive like a prisoner in bonds was the "king"! At this point in world history, Solomon was the ruler of the most powerful and wealthy nation in the world (1 Kings 3:13; 10:23-29).

It flourished in warm moist areas and oases from Egypt to India. Ancient Iraq was the leading grower of date palms and dates in the ancient world, as today (Pope, <i>Song of Songs</i>, 633). There is also a hint of eroticism in this palm tree metaphor because the palm tree was often associated with fertility in the ancient world. The point of comparison is that she is a tall, slender, fertile young woman. The comparison of a tall and slender lady to a palm tree is not uncommon in love literature: "O you, whose height is that of a palm tree in a serail" (Homer, <i>Odyssey</i> vi 162-63).

It is possible that this is an anomalous usage in reference to a cluster of dates rather than to a cluster of grapes for three reasons: (1) the "palm tree" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rm*T*</FONT>) referred to in 7:7 is a date palm, (2) the term "fruit stalks" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yN]s!n+s^</FONT>) in 7:8a refers to the fruit stalk of dates (<i>Rademus dactylorum</i>), being related to Akkadian <i>sissinnu</i> ("part of the date palm"), and (3) the reference to climbing the palm tree in 7:8a is best understood if it is a date palm and its fruit are dates. The comparison between her breasts and clusters of dates probably has to do with shape and multiplicity, as well as taste, as the rest of this extended metaphor intimates. Pope notes: "The comparison of the breasts to date clusters presumably intended a pair of clusters to match the dual form of the word for `breasts.' A single cluster of dates may carry over a thousand single fruits and weigh twenty pounds or more. It may be noted that the multiple breasts of the representations of Artemis of Ephesus look very much like a cluster of large dates, and it might be that the date clusters here were intended to suggest a similar condition of polymasty" (Pope, 634).<br>

 <a name="fn267" href="sos.htm#fnB267"><sup>24</sup></a><b>sn </b> (7:8) A Palestinian palm tree grower would climb a palm tree for two reasons: (1) to pluck the fruit and (2) to pollinate the female palm trees. Because of their height and because the dates would not naturally fall off the tree, the only way to harvest dates from a palm tree is to climb the tree and pluck the fruit off the stalks. This seems to be the primary imagery behind this figurative expression. The point of comparison here would be that just as one would climb a palm tree to pluck its fruit so that it might be eaten and enjoyed, so too Solomon wanted to embrace his Beloved so that he might embrace and enjoy her breasts. It is also possible that the process of pollination is also behind this figure. A palm tree is climbed to pick its fruit or to dust the female flowers with pollen from the male flowers (the female and male flowers were on separate trees). To obtain a better yield and accelerate the process of pollination, the date grower would transfer pollen from the male trees to the flowers on the female trees. This method of artificial pollination is depicted in ancient Near Eastern art. For example, a relief from Gozan (Tel Halaf) dating to the 9th century B.C. depicts a man climbing a palm tree on a wooden ladder with his hands stretched out to take hold of its top branches to pollinate the flowers or to pick the fruit from the tree. The point of this playful comparison is clear: Just as a palm-tree grower would climb a female tree to pick its fruit and to pollinate it with a male flower, Solomon wanted to grasp her breasts and to make love to her.

In the ancient Near East, fruits were stored away on shelves or cupboards above doorways where they were out of reach and left to dry until they became very sweet and delectable. The point of comparison in this figurative expression seems to be two-fold: (1) She was treasuring up special expressions of her sexual love to give to him, and (2) All these good things were for him alone to enjoy.

The juxtaposition of the two imperfects without an adjoining <i>vav</i> forms a conditional clause denoting a real condition (GKC 159.<i>b</i>).

The imperfects are used to express a condition and consequence which are regarded as being capable of fulfillment in the present or future time (GKC 159.<i>b</i>). The simple juxtaposition of two verbal clauses without any grammatical indicator, such as <i>vav</i> or a conditional particle, is rather rare: "If you rebel (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wlu*m=T!</FONT>), I will disperse you (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jyp!a*</FONT>) among the nations" (Neh 1:8); "If I counted them (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;r}P=s=a#</FONT>), they would be more numerous (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/WBr+y]</FONT>) than the sand!"

On the other hand, LXX treated the imperfects as denoting future temporal sequence: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">euJrou'sav se e]xw, filhvsw se</FONT> ("I will find you outside, I will kiss you"). Ordinarily, however, <i>vav</i> or a temporal particle introduces a temporal clause (Jo&uuml;on-Muraoka, <i>Grammar</i>, &#167;167; GKC 164). The English translation tradition generally adopts the conditional nuance: "If I found you outdoors, I would kiss you" (NASB), "Then, if I found you outside, I would kiss you" (NIV). However, a few translations adopt the temporal nuance: "When I should find thee without, I would kiss thee" (KJV), "Then I could kiss you when I met you in the street" (NJPS).<br>

 <a name="fn279" href="sos.htm#fnB279"><sup>5</sup></a><b>sn </b> (8:1) Song 8:1-2 may be classified as a "a lover's wish song" that is similar in content and structure to an ancient Egyptian love song in which the lover longs for greater intimacy with his beloved: "I wish I were her Negro maid who follows at her feet; then the skin of all her limbs would be revealed to me. I wish I were her washerman, if only for a month; then I would be [entranced], washing out the Moringa oils in her diaphanous garments. I wish I were the seal ring, the guardian of her [fingers]; then [...]" (The Cairo Love Songs, 25-27, in W. K. Simpson, ed., <i>The Literature of Ancient Egypt</i> [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972], 311). The Egyptian and Hebrew parallels display a similar structure: (1) introductory expression of the lover's wish to be something/someone in a position of physical closeness with the Beloved; (2) description of the person/thing that is physically close to the Beloved; and (3) concluding description of the resultant greater degree of intimacy with the Beloved. In the Egyptian parallel it is the man who longs for greater closeness; in the Hebrew song it is the woman. The Egyptian love song borders on the sensual; the Hebrew love song is simply romantic. The Beloved expresses her desire for greater freedom to display her affection for Solomon. In ancient Near Eastern cultures the public display of affection between a man and woman was frowned upon--sometimes even punished. For example, in Assyrian laws the punishment for a man kissing a woman in public was to cut off his upper lip. On the other hand, public displays of affection between children and between family members were allowed. Accordingly, the Beloved hyperbolically wished that she and Solomon were children from the same family so she could kiss him anytime she wished without fear of punishment or censure.<br>

This is an example of <i>casus</i> <i>pendus</i> in which the subject of the verb serves as a relative pronoun to the antecedent noun ("my mother"). The JPS parses <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn]d@M=l^T= </FONT>as 2ms ("that you might instruct me") rather than 3fs ("she would teach me"). However, this would obscure the imagery: The Beloved wished that Solomon was her little brother still nursing on her mother's breast. The Beloved, who had learned from her mother's example, would bring him inside their home and she would give him her breast: "I would give you spiced wine to drink, the nectar of my pomegranates."  <br>

The Beloved, who had learned from her mother's example, would bring him inside their home and she would give him her breast: "I would give you spiced wine to drink, the nectar of my pomegranates."

Seals were used to make a stamp impression to identify the object as the property of the seal's owner (<i>HALOT </i>300). Seals were made of semi-precious stone upon which was engraved a unique design and an inscription, e.g., LMLK [PN] "belonging to king [...]." The impression could be placed upon wet clay of a jar or on a writing tablet by rolling the seal across the clay. Because it was a valuable possession its owner would take careful precautions to not lose it and would keep it close to him at all times. Seals were often hung by cap or pin eyes from bracelets or necklaces. The Beloved's figurative request draws on two actions associated with the seal. First, just as a seal was rolled on wet clay in order to leave its impression to identify the person to whom the object belonged, so the Beloved wanted to be impressed on Solomon's heart. Second, just as a seal was attached to one's arm in order not to lose it, she was asking that Solomon keep her in a close relationship, which would never be lost.<br>

For example: "His soul was vexed to death," means that he could not stand it any longer (Judg 16:16). "I do well to be angry to death," means that he was extremely angry (Jonah 4:9).

 <a name="fn299" href="sos.htm#fnB299"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:7) <i>Heb</i> "rivers."<br>
 <a name="fn300" href="sos.htm#fnB300"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:7) <i>Heb</i> "all the wealth of his house."<br>
 <a name="fn301" href="sos.htm#fnB301"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:7) <i>Heb</i> "for love." The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B=</FONT> on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb*h&amp;a^B*</FONT> ("for love") indicates the price or exchange in trading (<i>HALOT </i>105.17), e.g., "Give me your vineyard in exchange for silver (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[s#k#B=</FONT>)" (1 Kgs 21:6).<br>
 <a name="fn302" href="sos.htm#fnB302"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:7) The root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">zWB</FONT> ("to despise") is repeated for emphasis: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WZWby&#180; zoB</FONT> (Qal infinitive absolute followed by Qal imperfect 3mpl). The infinitive absolute frequently is used with the imperfect of the same root for emphasis. The point is simply that love cannot be purchased; it is infinitely more valuable than any and all wealth. Love such as this is priceless; no price tag can be put on love.<br>
 <a name="fn303" href="sos.htm#fnB303"><sup>29</sup></a><b>sn </b> (8:8) The Beloved's brothers knew that once a couple is betrothed, sexual temptations would be at their greatest. Thus, in v. 9 they devise a plan to protect the purity of their sister: If she is a virtuous young woman, they would reward her; however, if she is wanton, they will restrain her and guard her from promiscuity.<br>
 <a name="fn304" href="sos.htm#fnB304"><sup>30</sup></a><b>sn </b> (8:9) The simile <i>if she is a wall</i> draws a comparison between the impregnability of a city fortified with a strong outer wall and a virtuous young woman who successfully resists any assaults against her virginity. The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*oj</FONT> ("wall") often refers to an outside fortress wall that protects the city from enemy military attacks (e.g., Lev 25:29-30; Josh 6:5; 1 Kgs 3:1; Neh 2:8; 12:27; Jer 1:8; 15:20).<br>
 <a name="fn305" href="sos.htm#fnB305"><sup>31</sup></a><b>sn </b> (8:9) The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hr&#180;yf!</FONT> ("battlement, turret") refers to the row of stones along the top of a fortress wall, set for the defense and stability of the wall (Ezek 46:23; cf. <i>HALOT </i>374). This structure is connected with military operations set in defense of a siege.<br>
 <a name="fn306" href="sos.htm#fnB306"><sup>32</sup></a> <b>sn </b> (8:9) The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rWx</FONT> II ("to surround, encircle, enclose") is often used in military contexts in reference to the siege or defense of a fortress city: (1) setting up military positions (siege-walls) to surround a besieged city (e.g., Isa 29:3); (2) encircling and laying siege to a city (e.g., Deut 20:12, 19; 2 Sam 11:1; 1 Kgs 15:27; 16:17; 20:1; 2 Kgs 6:24-25; 17:5; 19:9; 24:11; 1 Chr 20:1; Isa 21:2; 29:3; Jer 21:4, 9; 32:2; 37:5; 39:1; Ezek 4:3; Dan 1:1); (3) enclosing a city with sentries (e.g., Isa 29:3); (4) shutting a person within a city (1 Sam 23:8; 2 Sam 20:15; 2 Kgs 16:5); and (5) barricading a city door shut to prevent the city from being broken into and conquered (e.g., Song 8:7) (<i>HALOT </i>1015). See W. Rudolph, KAT 17:1-3, 182.<br>
 <a name="fn307" href="sos.htm#fnB307"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:9) <i>Heb</i> "a board." The singular noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">j~Wl</FONT> ("board, plank") may denote a singular of number or a collective.<br>
 <a name="fn308" href="sos.htm#fnB308"><sup>34</sup></a><b>sn </b> (8:9) An interesting semantic parallel involving the "door/bar" motif in ancient Near Eastern texts comes from an Assyrian charm against an enemy: "If he is a door, I will open your mouth; but if he is a bar, I will open your tongue." Obviously, the line in the Song is not an incantation; the formula is used in a love motif. Cited by J. Ebeling, "Aus dem Tagewerk eines assyrischen Zauberpriesters," MAOG 5 (1931): 19.<br>
 <a name="fn309" href="sos.htm#fnB309"><sup>35</sup></a><b>sn </b> (8:10) The noun<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> lD*g=m!</FONT> ("tower") can refer to the watchtowers of a fortified city (2 Kgs 17:9; 18:8; 2 Chr 26:9), projecting median towers along the fortified city wall which were crucial to the defense of the city (2 Chr 14:6; 26:15; 32:5), or fortress towers in the countryside set for the defense of the land (Judg 9:52; 2 Chr 27:4; Ezek 27:11) (<i>HALOT </i>544). The Beloved mixes metaphors by describing her breasts with a comparison of sense and a comparison of sight: (1) Comparison of sense: She successfully defended her virginity and sexual purity from seduction, as fortress towers defended the city. (2) Comparison of sight: Just as the fortress towers along a city wall projected out at the corners of the wall, the Beloved's breasts finally developed into beautiful "towers" (see 8:8 when she had no breasts as a young girl).<br>
 <a name="fn310" href="sos.htm#fnB310"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:10) <i>Heb</i> "peace." An eloquent wordplay is created by the use of the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;olv*</FONT> ("peace, favor") in 8:10b and the name <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm)Ov=</FONT> ("Solomon") in 8:11a. The Beloved found "favor" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;olv*</FONT>) in the eyes of Solomon (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm)Ov=</FONT>). She won his heart because she was not only a beautiful young woman ("my breasts were like fortress towers"), but a virtuous woman ("I was a wall").<br>
 <a name="fn311" href="sos.htm#fnB311"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:10) <i>Heb</i> "Then I became in his eyes as one who finds peace."<br>
 <a name="fn312" href="sos.htm#fnB312"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:11) <i>Heb</i> "gave."<br>
 <a name="fn313" href="sos.htm#fnB313"><sup>39</sup></a><b>sn </b> (8:12) The term "vineyard" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;r\K#</FONT>) is used literally in 8:11 in reference to Solomon's physical vineyard, but in 8:12 it is used figuratively (hypocatastasis) in reference to the Beloved: "my vineyard" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ym!r+K^</FONT>). Throughout the Song, the term "vineyard" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;r\K#</FONT>) is used figuratively (Song 1:6; 2:15; 8:12). In 8:12 it is used in reference to either (1) herself, (2) her choice of whom to give herself to in love, or (3) her physical body. In contrast to Solomon's physical vineyard, whose fruit can be bought and sold (8:11), she is not for sale: She will only give herself freely to the one whom she chooses to love.<br>
 <a name="fn314" href="sos.htm#fnB314"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:12) Each of the three terms in this line has the 1cs suffix which is repeated three times for emphasis: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ym!r+K^ </FONT>("my vineyard"), <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yL!v# </FONT>("which belongs to me"), and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn&#180;p*l=</FONT> ("at my disposal"). In contrast to King Solomon, who owns the vineyard at Baal-Hamon and who can buy and sell anything in the vineyard that he wishes, she proclaims that her "vineyard" (= herself or her body) belongs to her alone. In contrast to the vineyard, which can be leased out, and its fruit, which can be bought or sold, her "vineyard" is not for sale. Her love must and is to be freely given.<br>
 <a name="fn315" href="sos.htm#fnB315"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:12) <i>Heb</i> "[it is] at my disposal [alone]." The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn&#180;p*l=</FONT> can denote "at the disposal of" (e.g., Gen 13:9; 20:15; 24:51; 34:10; 47:6; Jer 40:4; 2 Chr 14:6 (<i>HALOT </i>924.4.f; BDB 817.4.a.f). Similar to Akkadian <i>ana</i> <i>pan</i> "at the disposal of" (<i>AHw</i> 821a paragraph 20), the term is used in reference to a sovereign (usually a land-owner or king) who has full power over his property to dispose of as he wishes, e.g., "The whole country is at your disposal (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;yn\p*l=</FONT>)" (Gen 13:9).  In Song 8:12 the form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn&#180;p*l=</FONT> has the 1cs suffix: "My vineyard, which belongs to me, is at my disposal." <br>
 <a name="fn316" href="sos.htm#fnB316"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:13) The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yb!yv!q=m^ </FONT>(Hiphil participle mpl from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bv^q*</FONT> "to listen") is in the Hiphil stem which denotes an intense desire to hear someone's voice, that is, to eagerly listen for someone's voice (e.g., Jer 6:17) (<i>HALOT </i>1151.1). The participle functions verbally and denotes a continual, ongoing, durative action.<br>
 <a name="fn317" href="sos.htm#fnB317"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tc </b> (8:13) The editors of <i>BHS</i> suggests that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn]a* &lt;g^</FONT> ("me also") should be inserted. Although there is no textual evidence for the insertion, it seems clear that the 1cs referent is emphatic in MT <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn]yu!ym!v=h^</FONT> ("Let me hear it!").   <br>
 <a name="fn318" href="sos.htm#fnB318"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:13) The imperative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn]yu!ym!v=h^</FONT> (Hiphil imperative 2fs with 1cs suffix from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">um^v*</FONT> "to hear") functions as a request (e.g., Waltke-O'Connor, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 34.4.b). The lover asks his beloved to let him hear her beautiful voice (e.g., Song 2:14).
