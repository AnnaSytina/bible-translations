 <b>sn</b> (1:1)  Chapter 1 introduces the theme of bondage in Egypt and shows the intensifying opposition to the fulfillment of promises given earlier to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The first seven verses announce the theme of Israel's prosperity in Egypt. The second section (vv. 8-14) reports continued prosperity in the face of deliberate opposition. And the third section (vv. 15-21) explains the prosperity as divine favor in spite of Pharaoh's covert attempts at controlling the population. The final verse forms a culmination in the developing tyranny and a transition to the next section--Pharaoh commands the open murder of the males. The reader should note the power of God revealed in the chapter as the people flourish under the forces of evil. However, by the turn of affairs at the end of the chapter, the reader is left with a question about the power of God-- "What can God do?" This is good Hebrew narrative, moving the reader through tension after tension to reveal the sovereign power and majesty of the LORD God, but calling for faith every step of the way. See also D. W. Wicke, "The Literary Structure of Exodus 1:2-2:10," <i>JSOT</i> 24 (1982): 99-107.<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="exo.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Heb</i> "now these" or "and these." The <i>vav</i> disjunctive here marks a new beginning in the narrative begun in Genesis. The fact that the Book of Genesis forms an introduction to the Book of Exodus is established more by their contents than by this use of the <i>vav</i>, whose force is conveyed by the break between the two books.<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="exo.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:1)  The name of the Book of Exodus in the Hebrew Bible is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tomv=</FONT> (<i>s<sup>e</sup>mot</i>), the word for "Names," drawn from the beginning of the book. The inclusion of the names at this point forms a literary connection to the Book of Genesis. It indicates that the Israelites living in bondage had retained a knowledge of their ancestry, and with it, a knowledge of God's promise.<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="exo.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  The Hebrew expression <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">la@r*c=y] yn}B= </FONT>(<i>b<sup>e</sup>ne Yisra'el</i>) in most places refers to the nation and can be translated "Israelites," although traditionally it has been rendered "the children of Israel" or "the sons of Israel." Here it refers primarily to the individual sons of the patriarch Israel, for they are named. But the expression is probably also intended to indicate that they are the Israelites.<br>
 <a name="fn4" href="exo.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Heb</i> "a man and his house." Since this serves to explain "the sons of Israel," it has the distributive sense. So while the "sons of Israel" refers to the actual sons of the patriarch, the expression includes their families.<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="exo.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  The Hebrew text uses <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp#n\ </FONT>(<i>nepesh</i>), which is often translated "soul." But the word refers to the whole person, the body with the soul, and so "life" or "person" would be a better translation; here: "all the people" or "the lives."<br>
 <a name="fn6" href="exo.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  The expression in apposition to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp#n\</FONT> literally says "those who went out from the loins of Jacob." This distinguishes the entire company as his direct descendants.<br>
 <a name="fn7" href="exo.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:5)  The Greek text and the Dead Sea Scrolls have the number as seventy-five, counting the people a little differently. E. H. Merrill makes the following observation in conjunction with F. Delitzsch, namely, that the fact that the list in Gen 46 enumerates all the people who entered Egypt, including those like Hezron and Hamul who did so <i>in potentia</i>, since they were born after the family entered Egypt (F. Delitzsch, <i>Genesis</i>, 2:340), and the fact that Joseph's sons are included in the list of those entering Egypt, though they were also born there, shows that the list should not be pressed too literally (E. H. Merrill, <i>Kingdom of Priests</i>, 49). <br>
 <a name="fn8" href="exo.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Heb</i> "and Joseph was in Egypt."<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="exo.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  The text simply uses the <i>vav</i> consecutive with the preterite, "and Joseph died." While this construction shows sequence with the preceding verse, it does not require that the death follow directly the report of that verse. In fact, we know from the record in Genesis that the death of Joseph occurred after a good number of years. The interpretation of the <i>vav</i> is therefore warranted; the verse indicates the passage of time in the natural course of events.<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="exo.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  The verse literally reads, "and Joseph died, and all his brothers, and all that generation." But typical of Hebrew style the verb need only agree with the first of a compound subject. <br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:6)  Since the death of <i>Joseph and his brothers and all that generation</i> was common knowledge, its inclusion must serve some rhetorical purpose. In contrast to the theme of the chapter, the flourishing of Israel, there is death. This theme will appear again: in spite of death in Egypt, the nation flourishes. <br>
 <a name="fn11" href="exo.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  The disjunctive <i>vav</i> marks a contrast with the note about the deaths of the first generation.<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="exo.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  <i>Heb</i> "the children/sons of Israel."<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="exo.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:7)  The text is clearly going out of its way to say that the people of Israel flourished in Egypt. The verbs <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrP</FONT> (<i>para</i>), "be fruitful," <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jrv</FONT> (<i>saras</i>), "swarm, teem," <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbr</FONT> (<i>raba</i>), "multiply," and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;xu</FONT> (<i>`asam</i>), "be strong, mighty," form a literary link to the creation account in Genesis. The text describes Israel's prosperity in the terms of God's original command to be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth, to show that their prosperity was by divine blessing and in compliance with the will of God. The commission for the creation to fill the earth and subdue it would now begin to materialize through the seed of Abraham.<br>
 <b>tn</b> (1:7)  Using <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">da)m=</FONT> (<i>m<sup>e</sup>'od</i>) twice intensifies the idea of their becoming strong (see GKC &#167;133.<i>k</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="exo.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:8)  It would be difficult to identify who this <i>new king</i> might be, since the chronology of ancient Israel is continually debated. Scholars who take the numbers in the Bible more or less at face value would place the time of Jacob's going down to Egypt in about 1876 B.C. This would put Joseph's experience in the period prior to the Hyksos control of Egypt (1720-1570's), because everything in the narrative about Joseph points to a native Egyptian setting and not a Hyksos one. Joseph's death, then, would have been around 1806 B.C., just a few years prior to the end of the 12th Dynasty of Egypt. This marked the end of the mighty Middle Kingdom of Egypt. The relationship between the Hyksos (also Semites) and the Israelites would have been amicable; the Hyksos then might very well be the enemies that the Egyptians feared in Exodus 1:10. It makes good sense to see the new king who did not know Joseph as either the founder (Amosis, 1570-1546) or an early king of the powerful 18th Dynasty (like Thutmose I). Egypt under this new leadership drove out the Hyksos and reestablished Egyptian sovereignty. The new rulers certainly would have been concerned about an increasing Semite population in their territory (see E. H. Merrill, <i>Kingdom of Priests</i>, 49-55).<br>
 <a name="fn15" href="exo.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:8)  The relative clause comes last in the verse in Hebrew. It simply clarifies that the new king had no knowledge about Joseph. It also introduces a major theme in the early portion of Exodus, as a later Pharaoh will claim not to know who Yahweh is. The LORD, however, will work to make sure that Pharaoh and all Egypt will know that he is the true God.<br>
 <a name="fn16" href="exo.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:8)  <i>Heb</i> "arose."<br>
 <a name="fn17" href="exo.htm#fnB17"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  <i>Heb</i> "and he said."<br>
 <a name="fn18" href="exo.htm#fnB18"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hN}h!</FONT> (<i>hinneh</i>) introduces the foundational clause for the exhortation to follow. In other words, the exhortation that follows is based on this observation. The particle could be translated "since, because," or the like.<br>
 <a name="fn19" href="exo.htm#fnB19"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  The verb is the Hitpael cohortative of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;kj</FONT> (<i>hakam</i>), "to be wise." This verb has the idea of acting shrewdly, dealing wisely. The basic idea in the word group is that of skill. So a skillful decision is required to prevent the Israelites from multiplying any more. <br>
 <a name="fn20" href="exo.htm#fnB20"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/P#</FONT> (<FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">pen</FONT>) expresses fear or precaution and is rendered either "lest" or "else" (Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;461).<br>
 <a name="fn21" href="exo.htm#fnB21"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  The verb literally means "multiply," but since the text has already indicated that they were doing that, the nuance here must mean to multiply all the more, or to continue to multiply. <br>
 <a name="fn22" href="exo.htm#fnB22"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  The words <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK! hy&#180;h&#180;w+ </FONT>(<FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">w<sup>e</sup>hayah ki</FONT>) introduce a conditional clause-- "if" (see GKC &#167;112.<i>y</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn23" href="exo.htm#fnB23"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  <i>Heb</i> "and [lest] he [Israel] also be joined to."<br>
 <a name="fn24" href="exo.htm#fnB24"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  <i>Heb</i> "and go up." All the verbs coming after the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/P#</FONT> (<FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">pen</FONT>, "otherwise" in v. 10) have the same force and are therefore parallel. These are the fears of the Egyptians. This explains why a shrewd policy of population control was required. They wanted to keep Israel enslaved; they did not want them to become too numerous and escape.<br>
 <a name="fn25" href="exo.htm#fnB25"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  <i>Heb</i> "placed" or "put."<br>
 <a name="fn26" href="exo.htm#fnB26"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">sm^</FONT> (<i>mas</i>) refers to a labor gang organized to provide unpaid labor, or corv&eacute;e (Deut 20:11; Josh 17:13; 1 Kgs 9:15, 21). <br>
 <a name="fn27" href="exo.htm#fnB27"><sup>28</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:11)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">otN)u^</FONT> (<i>`annoto</i>), "to oppress him [Israel]," is the Piel infinitive construct from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnu</FONT> (<i>`ana</i>). The word has a wide range of meanings that need to be surveyed. Here the word would include physical abuse, forced subjugation, and humiliation. This king was trying to crush the spirit of Israel by increasing their slave labor. Other terms in the passage that describe this intent include "bitter" and "crushing." <br>
 <a name="fn28" href="exo.htm#fnB28"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  The form in the text is the preterite with the <i>vav</i> consecutive, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/b#Y]w~</FONT> (<i>wayyiben</i>). The sequence expressed in this context includes the idea of result.<br>
 <a name="fn29" href="exo.htm#fnB29"><sup>30</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:11)  Many scholars assume that because this city was named Rameses the Pharaoh had to be Rameses II, and hence that the later date of the exodus (and the later time of the sojourn in Egypt) is proved. But if the details of the context are taken as seriously as the mention of this name, this cannot be the case. If we grant for the sake of discussion that Rameses II was on the throne and oppressing Israel, we would note that Moses is not born yet. It would take about twenty or more years to build the city, then eighty more years before Moses appears before Pharaoh (Rameses), and then a couple of years for the plagues--this man would have been Pharaoh for over a hundred years. That is clearly not the case for the historical Rameses II. But even more determining is the fact that whoever the Pharaoh was for whom the Israelites built the treasure cities, he died before Moses began the plagues. The Bible says that when Moses grew up and killed the Egyptian, he fled from Pharaoh (whoever that was) and remained in exile until he heard that that Pharaoh had died. So this verse cannot be used for a date of the exodus in the days of Rameses, unless many other details in the chapters are ignored. If it is argued that Rameses was the Pharaoh of the oppression, then his successor would have been the Pharaoh of the exodus. Rameses reigned from 1304 B.C. until 1236 and then was succeeded by Merneptah. That would put the exodus far too late in time, for the Merneptah stela refers to Israel as a settled nation in their land. One would have to say that the name Rameses in this chapter may either refer to an earlier king, or, more likely, reflect an updating in the narrative to name the city according to its later name (it was called something else when they built it, but later Rameses finished it and named it after himself [see Benno Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 14]). For further discussion see G. L. Archer, "An 18th Dynasty Ramses," <i>JETS</i> 17 (1974): 49-50; and C. F. Aling, "The Biblical City of Ramses," <i>JETS</i> 25 (1982): 129-37. Furthermore, for vv. 11-14, see K. A. Kitchen, "From the Brick Fields of Egypt," <i>TynBul</i> 27 (1976): 137-47. <br>
 <a name="fn30" href="exo.htm#fnB30"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:12)  <i>Heb</i> "they"; the referent (the Egyptians) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn31" href="exo.htm#fnB31"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:12)  The imperfect tenses in this verse are customary uses, expressing continual action in past time (see GKC &#167;107.<i>e</i>). For other examples of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rv#a&amp;K^</FONT> with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/K@</FONT> expressing a comparison ("just as...so") see Gen 41:13; Judg 1:7; Isa 31:4.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:12)  There was nothing in the oppression that caused this, of course. Rather, the blessing of God (Gen 12:1-3) was on Israel in spite of the efforts of Egypt to hinder it. According to Gen 15 God had foretold that there would be this period of oppression (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnu</FONT> in Gen 15:13). In other words, God had decreed and predicted both their becoming a great nation and their oppression, to show that he could fulfill his promise to Abraham in spite of the bondage and oppression. <br>
 <a name="fn32" href="exo.htm#fnB32"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:12)  <i>Heb</i> "they felt a loathing before/because of"; the referent (the Egyptians) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>

 <a name="fn34" href="exo.htm#fnB34"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13)  <i>Heb</i> "with rigor, oppression."<br>
 <a name="fn35" href="exo.htm#fnB35"><sup>36</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:14)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rrm</FONT> (<i>marar</i>) anticipates the introduction of the theme of bitterness in the instructions for the passover. <br>
 <a name="fn36" href="exo.htm#fnB36"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:14)  The preposition <i>bet</i> in this verse has the instrumental use: "by means of" (see GKC &#167;119.<i>o</i>). <br>
 <a name="fn37" href="exo.htm#fnB37"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:14)  <i>Heb</i> "and in all service."<br>
 <a name="fn38" href="exo.htm#fnB38"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:14)  The line might more literally be translated, "All their service in which they served them [was] with rigor." This takes the referent of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">mh#B*</FONT> to be the Egyptians. the pronoun may also resume the reference to the kinds of service and so not be needed in English: "all their service in which they served [was] with rigor."<br>
 <a name="fn39" href="exo.htm#fnB39"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:15)  <i>Heb</i> "and the king of Egypt said."<br>
 <a name="fn40" href="exo.htm#fnB40"><sup>41</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:15)  The word for "midwife" is simply the Piel participle of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dly</FONT> (<i>yalad</i>), "to give birth." So these were women who assisted in the childbirth process. It seems probable that given the number of the Israelites in the passage, these two women would not have been the only Hebrew midwives, but may have been over the midwives (Rashi). Moreover, the LXX and Vulgate do not take "Hebrew" as an adjective, but as a genitive after the construct, yielding "midwives of/over the Hebrews." This leaves open the possibility that these women were not Hebrews. This would solve the question of how the king ever expected Hebrew midwives to kill Hebrew children. And yet, the two women have Hebrew names.<br>
 <a name="fn41" href="exo.htm#fnB41"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:15)  <i>Heb</i> "who the name of the first [was] Shiphrah, and the name of the second [was] Puah."<br>
 <a name="fn42" href="exo.htm#fnB42"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:16)  The verse starts with the verb that began the last verse; to read it again would seem redundant in English. Some versions render it "spoke" in v. 15 and "said" in v. 16.<br>
 <a name="fn43" href="exo.htm#fnB43"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:16)  The form is the Piel infinitive construct serving in an adverbial clause of time. This clause lays the foundation for the next verb, the Qal perfect with a <i>vav</i> consecutive: "when you assist...then you will observe." The latter carries an instructional nuance (= the imperfect of instruction), "you are to observe." <br>
 <a name="fn44" href="exo.htm#fnB44"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:16)  <i>Heb</i> "at the birthstool," but since this particular item is not especially well known today, the translation simply states "at the delivery."<br>
 <a name="fn45" href="exo.htm#fnB45"><sup>46</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:16)  The instructions must have been temporary or selective, otherwise the decree from the king would have ended the slave population of Hebrews. It is also possible that the king did not think through this, but simply took steps to limit the population growth. The narrative is not interested in supplying details, only in portraying the king as a wicked fool bent on destroying Israel.<br>
 <a name="fn46" href="exo.htm#fnB46"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:16)  The last form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hy&#180;j*w&#180;</FONT> (<i>wahaya</i>) in the verse is unusual; it is written as a geminate in pause for the third feminine singular form (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hy&#180;j~w&#180;</FONT>), the form not having the <i>daghesh forte </i>in pause (GKC &#167;76.<i>i</i>).<i> </i>In the conditional clause, following the parallel instruction ("kill him"), this form should be rendered "she may live" or "let her live."<i> </i><br>
 <a name="fn47" href="exo.htm#fnB47"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:17)  <i>Heb</i> "and they [fem. pl.] feared"; the referent (the midwives) has been specified in the translation for clarity. <br>
 <a name="fn48" href="exo.htm#fnB48"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:17)  The verb is the Piel preterite of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hyh </FONT>(<i>haya</i>), "to live." The Piel often indicates a factitive nuance with stative verbs, showing the cause of the action. Here it means "let live, cause to live." The verb is the exact opposite of Pharaoh's command for them to kill the little boys.<br>
 <a name="fn49" href="exo.htm#fnB49"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:18)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">arq</FONT> (<i>qara'</i>) followed by the <i>lamed</i> preposition has here the nuance of "summon." The same construction will be used later when Pharaoh summons Moses.<br>
 <a name="fn50" href="exo.htm#fnB50"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:18)  The second verb is a preterite with a <i>vav</i> consecutive. It may indicate a simple sequence: Why have you done...and (so that you) let live?" It could also indicate that this is a second question, "Why have you done ...[why] have you let live?" <br>
 <a name="fn51" href="exo.htm#fnB51"><sup>52</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:19)  See further N. Lemche, "`Hebrew' as a National Name for Israel," <i>ST</i> 33 (1979):1-23.<br>
 <a name="fn52" href="exo.htm#fnB52"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:19)  <i>Heb</i> "they"; the referent (the Hebrew women) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn53" href="exo.htm#fnB53"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:19)  The noun and the verb are singular, but collective.<br>
 <a name="fn54" href="exo.htm#fnB54"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:19)  <i>Heb</i> "before the midwife comes to them [and] they give birth." The perfect tense with the <i>vav</i> consecutive serves as the apodosis to the preceding temporal clause; it has the frequentative nuance (see GKC &#167;112.<i>oo</i>).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:19)  The point of this brief section is that the midwives feared God more than the king. They simply followed a higher authority that prohibited killing. Fearing God is a basic part of the true faith that leads to an obedient course of action and is not terrified by worldly threats. There probably was enough truth in what they were saying; but they clearly had no intention of honoring the king by participating in murder. And they saw no reason to give him a straightforward answer. God honored their actions. <br>
 <a name="fn55" href="exo.htm#fnB55"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:20)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bf#yY}w~</FONT> (<i>wayyeteb</i>) is the Hiphil preterite of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bfy</FONT>. In this stem the word means "to cause good, treat well, treat favorably." The <i>vav</i> consecutive shows that this favor from God was a result of their fearing and obeying him. <br>
 <a name="fn56" href="exo.htm#fnB56"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:21)  The temporal indicator <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yh!y+w~</FONT> (<i>wayhi</i>) focuses attention on the causal clause and lays the foundation for the main clause, namely, "God made households for them." This is the second time the text affirms the reason for their defiance, their fear of God.<br>
 <a name="fn57" href="exo.htm#fnB57"><sup>58</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:21)  Or "families"; <i>Heb</i> "houses."<br>
 <a name="fn58" href="exo.htm#fnB58"><sup>59</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:22)  The substantive <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lK)</FONT> (<i>kol</i>) followed by the article stresses the entirety-- "all sons" or "all daughters" (see GKC &#167;127.<i>b</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn59" href="exo.htm#fnB59"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:22)  The imperfect is either instruction or injunction. The form includes a pronominal suffix that reiterates the object of the verb: "every son...you will throw it."<br>
 <a name="fn60" href="exo.htm#fnB60"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:22)  The imperfect could be instruction or injunction. But it could also have the nuance of permission, which may fit better. The Pharaoh is simply allowing the girls to live.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:22)  Verse 22 forms a fitting climax to the chapter, in which the king continually seeks to destroy the Israelite strength. Finally, with this decree, he throws off any subtlety and commands the extermination of Hebrew males. The verse forms a marvelous transition to the next chapter, in which Moses is saved by the daughter of Pharaoh himself. These chapters show that the king's efforts to destroy the strength of Israel--so clearly a work of God--met with failure again and again. And that failure was usually from the efforts of women, whom Pharaoh did not consider a threat. <br>
 <a name="fn61" href="exo.htm#fnB61"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:1)  The chapter records the exceptional survival of Moses under the decree of death by Pharaoh (vv. 1-10), the flight of Moses from Pharaoh after killing the Egyptian (vv. 11-15), the marriage of Moses (vv. 16-22), and finally a note about the LORD's hearing the sighing of the people in bondage (vv. 23-25). The first part is the birth. The Bible has several stories about miraculous or special births and deliverances of those destined to lead Israel. Their impact is essentially to authenticate the individual's ministry: if the person's beginning was providentially provided and protected by the LORD, then the mission must be of divine origin too. In this chapter the plot works around the decree for the death of the children--a decree undone by the women. The second part of the chapter records Moses' flight and marriage. Having introduced the deliverer Moses in such an auspicious way, the chapter then records how this deliverer acted presumptuously and had to flee for his life. Any deliverance God desired had to be supernatural, as the chapter's final note about answering prayer shows. <br>

 <b>sn</b> (2:1)  The first part of this section is the account of hiding the infant (vv. 1-4). The marriage, the birth, the hiding of the child, and the positioning of Miriam, are all faith operations that ignore the decree of Pharaoh, or at least work around it to preserve the life of the child.<br>

 <a name="fn66" href="exo.htm#fnB66"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:2)  A preterite form with the <i>vav</i> consecutive can be subordinated to a following clause. What she saw stands as a reason for what she did: "when she saw...she hid him three months."<br>
 <a name="fn67" href="exo.htm#fnB67"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:2)  After verbs of perceiving or seeing there are frequently two objects, the formal accusative ("him") and then a noun clause that explains what it was about the child that she perceived ("that he was healthy").

 <a name="fn68" href="exo.htm#fnB68"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:2)  Or "fine" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bof </FONT>[<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">tob</FONT>]). The appearance indicated to her that the child enjoyed divine favor. The construction is parallel to the creation narrative ("and God saw that it was good"). Benno Jacob says, "She looked upon her child with a joy similar to that of God upon His creation (Gen 1.4ff.)" (<i>Exodus</i>, 25). <br>

 <a name="fn70" href="exo.htm#fnB70"><sup>10</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:3)  The circumstances of the saving of the child Moses have prompted several attempts by scholars to compare the material to the Sargon myth. See R. F. Johnson, "Moses," in <i>IDB; </i>for the text see<i> </i>L. W. King, <i>Chronicles concerning Early Babylonian Kings, Vol. 2, Texts and Translations</i> (London: Luzac and Co., 1907), 87-90. Those who see the narrative using the Sargon story's pattern would be saying that the account presents Moses in imagery common to the ancient world's expectations of extraordinary achievement and deliverance. In the Sargon story the infant's mother put him into a basket in a river; he was loved by the gods and destined for greatness. Saying Israel used this to invent the account in Exodus would be an unacceptable determination. But there are other difficulties with the Sargon comparison, not the least of which is the fact that there are no other samples of this type of story for comparison, and the meaning and function of the story are unclear. Second, there is no threat to the child Sargon. The account simply shows how a child was exposed, rescued, nurtured, and became king (see Brevard Child's commentary on Exodus). Third, other details do not fit: Moses is never completely abandoned, never out of the care of his parents; and the finder is a princess and not a goddess. It seems unlikely that two stories, and only two, that have some similar motifs would be sufficient to make up a whole genre. Moreover, if we do not know the precise function and meaning of the Sargon story, it is almost impossible to use it as a pattern for the biblical account. By itself, the idea of a mother abandoning a child to the river would have been fairly sensible, for that is where the women of the town would be washing their clothes or bathing. If someone wanted to be sure the infant was discovered by a sympathetic woman, there would be no better setting (see A. Cole, <i>Exodus</i>, 57). While we may not be dealing with a genre of storytelling here, it is possible that Exodus 2 might have drawn on some of the motifs and forms of the other account to describe the actual event in the sparing of Moses--if they knew of it. If so it would show that Moses was cast in the form of the greats of the past. <br>
 <a name="fn71" href="exo.htm#fnB71"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  Or "stood." The verb is the Hitpael preterite of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bxy</FONT> (<i>yasab</i>), although the form is anomalous and perhaps should be read with Sam (see GKC &#167;71). The form yields the meaning of "take a stand, position or station oneself." His sister found a good vantage point to wait and see what might become of the infant.<br>
 <a name="fn72" href="exo.htm#fnB72"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  <i>Heb</i> "to know."<br>
 <a name="fn73" href="exo.htm#fnB73"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  The verb is a Niphal imperfect; it should be classified here as a historic future, future from the perspective of the past time narrative.<br>
 <a name="fn74" href="exo.htm#fnB74"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:5)  It is impossible, perhaps, to identify with any certainty who this person was. For those who have taken a view that Rameses was the pharaoh, there were numerous daughters for Rameses. The book of <i>Jubilees</i> names her Tharmuth (47:5); Josephus spells it Thermouthis (<i>Ant.</i> 2.9.5), but Eusebius has Merris (<i>Praep. Ev.</i> ix. 27). Merrill makes a reasonable case for her identification as the famous Hatshepsut, daughter of Thutmose I. She would have been there about the time of Moses' birth, and the general picture of her from history would show her to be the kind of princess with enough courage to countermand a decree of her father (E. H. Merrill, <i>Kingdom of Priests,</i> 60). <br>
 <a name="fn75" href="exo.htm#fnB75"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:5)  Or "bathe."<br>
 <a name="fn76" href="exo.htm#fnB76"><sup>16</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:5)  The clause begins with a disjunctive <i>vav</i> indicating a circumstantial clause. The picture is one of a royal entourage coming down to the edge of a tributary of the river, and while the princess was bathing, her female attendants were walking along the edge of the water out of the way of the princess. They may not have witnessed the discovery or the discussion. <br>
 <a name="fn77" href="exo.htm#fnB77"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:5)  The preterite with the <i>vav</i> consecutive is here subordinated to the next sequential verb form as a temporal clause. <br>
 <a name="fn78" href="exo.htm#fnB78"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:5)  The word here is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*a*</FONT> (<i>`amah</i>), which means "female slave." The word for the "attendants" is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tr)u&amp;n~</FONT> (<i>na'arot</i>), "young women," referring to attendants and courtiers.<br>
 <a name="fn79" href="exo.htm#fnB79"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:5)  The verb is the preterite, 3fsg, with a pronominal suffix, from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jql</FONT> (<i>laqah</i>), "to take." The form in the text says literally "and she took it." Some translations smooth out the reading by making this a purpose clause, "to fetch it." The present translation conveys it as a descriptive relative clause, so that Pharaoh's daughter, not the servant, remains more clearly the actor in v. 6.<br>
 <a name="fn80" href="exo.htm#fnB80"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6)  <i>Heb</i> "and she opened" (with the direct object, "it," supplied).<br>
 <a name="fn81" href="exo.htm#fnB81"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6)  The grammatical construction has a pronominal suffix on the verb as the direct object along with the expressed object: "and she saw him, the child." The second object defines the previous pronominal object to avoid misunderstanding (see GKC &#167;131.<i>m</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn82" href="exo.htm#fnB82"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6)  The text has <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ru^n~</FONT> (<i>na'ar</i>), "lad, boy, young man," which in this context would mean a baby boy. <br>
 <a name="fn83" href="exo.htm#fnB83"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6)  This clause is introduced with a disjunctive <i>vav </i>and the deictic particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hN}h!</FONT> (<i>hinneh</i>), the "behold" of the KJV. The particle in this kind of clause introduces the unexpected--what she saw when she opened the basket: "and look, there was a baby boy crying." The clause provides a parenthetical description of the child when she opened the basket and does not advance the narrative. The clause is an important addition, for it explains the compassion in the woman. <br>
 <a name="fn84" href="exo.htm#fnB84"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6)  The verb could be given a more colloquial translation such as "she felt sorry for him." But the verb is stronger than that; it means "to have compassion, to pity, to spare." What she felt for the baby was strong enough to prompt her to spare the child from the fate decreed for Hebrew boys. Here is part of the irony of the passage: what was perceived by many to be a womanly weakness--compassion for a baby--is a strong enough emotion to prompt the woman to defy the orders of the pharaoh. The ruler had thought sparing women was safe; but the midwives, the Hebrew mother, the daughter of Pharaoh, and Miriam, all work together to spare one child--Moses. God uses the things that are not to confound the things that are (cf. 1 Cor 1:27-28). <br>
 <a name="fn85" href="exo.htm#fnB85"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:7)  The text uses <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">arq</FONT> (<i>qara'</i>) followed by the <i>lamed</i> preposition, meaning "to summon." Pharaoh himself will "summon" Moses many times in the plague narratives. Here the word is used for the daughter summoning the child's mother to take care of him. The narratives in the first part of the Book of Exodus include a good deal of foreshadowing of events that occur in later sections of the book (see Michael Fishbane, <i>Text and Texture</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn86" href="exo.htm#fnB86"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:7)  The object of the verb "get/summon" is "a woman." But "nurse" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tq\n\ym@</FONT> [<i>meneqet</i>], the Hiphil participle of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qny</FONT> [<i>yanaq</i>], "to suck") is in apposition to it, clarifying what kind of woman should be found--a woman, a nursing one. Of course Moses' mother was ready for the task. <br>
 <a name="fn87" href="exo.htm#fnB87"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:7)  The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qn]yt@w+</FONT> (<i>w<sup>e</sup>teniq</i>) is the Hiphil imperfect/jussive, 3fsg, of the same root as the word for "nurse." It is here subordinated to the preceding imperfect ("shall I go") and perfect with <i>vav</i> consecutive ("and summon") to express the purpose: "in order that she may."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:7)  No respectable Egyptian woman of this period would have undertaken the task of nursing a foreigner's baby, and so the suggestion by Miriam was proper and necessary. Since she was standing a small distance away from the events, she was able to come forward when the discovery was made.<br>
 <a name="fn88" href="exo.htm#fnB88"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:8)  <i>Heb</i> "Go."<br>
 <a name="fn89" href="exo.htm#fnB89"><sup>29</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:8)  The word used to describe the sister (Miriam probably) is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*l=u^</FONT> (<i>`alma</i>), the same word used in Isa 7:14, where it is usually translated either "virgin" or "young woman." The word basically means a young woman who is ripe for marriage (and in proper Jewish society, and certainly as a divine sign, a virgin). This would indicate that Miriam is a teenager and so about fifteen years older than Moses. <br>
 <a name="fn90" href="exo.htm#fnB90"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:8)  <i>Heb</i> <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">arq</FONT> (<i>qara'</i>), "called."<br>
 <a name="fn91" href="exo.htm#fnB91"><sup>31</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:8)  During this period of Egyptian history the royal palaces were in the northern or Delta area of Egypt, as opposed to up the Nile as in the later periods. The proximity of the royal residences to the Israelites makes this and the plague narratives all the more realistic. Such direct contact would have been unlikely if Moses had had to travel up the Nile to meet with Pharaoh. In the Delta area things were closer. Here all the people would have had access to the tributaries of the Nile near where the royal family came; but the royal family probably had pavilions and hunting lodges in the area. See also N. Osborn, "Where on Earth Are We? Problems of Position and Movement in Space," <i>BT</i> 31 (1980): 239-42.<br>
 <a name="fn92" href="exo.htm#fnB92"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:9)  <i>Heb</i> "her." The referent (the woman) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn93" href="exo.htm#fnB93"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:9)  The verb is the Hiphil imperative of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ilh</FONT> (<i>halak</i>), and so is properly rendered "cause to go" or "take away."<br>
 <a name="fn94" href="exo.htm#fnB94"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:9)  The possessive pronoun on the noun "wage" expresses the indirect object: "I will pay wages to you."<br>
 <a name="fn95" href="exo.htm#fnB95"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:10)  The verb is the preterite of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ldG </FONT>(<i>gadal</i>), and so might be normally rendered "and he became great." But the context suggests that it refers to when he was weaned and before he was named, perhaps indicating he was three or four years old (see Gen 21:8).<br>
 <a name="fn96" href="exo.htm#fnB96"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:10)  The idiomatic expression literally reads: "and he was to her for a son." In this there are two prepositions <i>lamed.</i> The first expresses possession: "he was to her" means "she had." The second is part of the usage of the verb: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hyh</FONT> (<i>haya</i>) with the <i>lamed</i> preposition means "to become." <br>
 <a name="fn97" href="exo.htm#fnB97"><sup>37</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:10)  The naming provides the climax and summary of the story. The name of "Moses" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hv#m)</FONT> [<i>moseh</i>]) is here explained by the sentiment "I have drawn him [<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wht!yv!m=</FONT> (<i>m<sup>e</sup>sitihu</i>)] from the water." It appears that the name is etymologically connected to the perfect tense in the saying, which is from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hvm</FONT> (<i>masah</i>), "to draw out." But commentators have found it a little difficult that the explanation of the name by the daughter of Pharaoh is in Hebrew when the whole background is Egyptian (Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 20). Moreover, the Hebrew spelling of the name is the form of the active participle ("the one who draws out"); to be a precise description it should have been spelled <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yWvm*</FONT> (<i>masuy</i>), the passive participle ("the one drawn out"). The etymology is not precise; rather, it is a word play (called paronomasia). Either the narrator merely attributed words to her (which is unlikely unless we were dealing with fiction), or the Hebrew account simply translated what she had said into Hebrew, finding a Hebrew verb with the same letters as the name. Such word plays on names (also popular etymology) are common in the Bible. Most agree that the name is an Egyptian name. Josephus attempted to connect the biblical etymology with the name in Greek, <i>Mouses</i>, stating that <i>Mo</i> is Egyptian for water, and <i>uses</i> means those rescued from it (<i>Ant.</i> 2.9.6; see also J. Gwyn Griffiths, "The Egyptian Derivation of the Name Moses," <i>JNES</i> 12 [1953]: 225). But the solution to the name is not to be derived from the Greek rendering. The princess would have thought of the child from the river as the supernatural provision due to the estimation Egyptians had of the Nile. The Egyptian hieroglyphic <i>ms</i> can be the noun "child" or the perfective verb "be born." This was often connected with divine elements for names: <i>Ptah-mose</i>, "Ptah is born." Also the name Rameses (<i>R'-m-sw</i>) means "[the god] Re' is he who has born him." If the name Moses is Egyptian, there are some philological difficulties (see the above article for their treatment). The significance of all this is that when the child was named by the princess, an Egyptian word related to <i>ms</i> was used, meaning something like "child" or "born." The name might have even been longer, perhaps having a theophoric element (divine name) with it--"child of [some god]." The name's motivation came from the fact that she drew him from the Nile, the source of life in Egypt. But the sound of the name given to him recalled for the Hebrews the verb "to draw out," which in their language had the same or similar letters. Translating the words in the account into Hebrew allowed for the effective word play to capture the significance of the story in the sound of the name. It is as if they are saying through this translation: "You called him `born one' in your language and after your custom, but in our language that name means `drawing out'--which is what was to become of him. You drew him out of the water, but he would draw us out of Egypt through the water." So the circumstances of the story show Moses to be a man of destiny; and this naming episode summarizes how divine providence was at work in Israel. To the Israelites the name forever commemorated the portent of this event in the early life of the great deliverer (see Isa 63:11).<br>
 <a name="fn98" href="exo.htm#fnB98"><sup>38</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:11)  Chapter 1 described how Israel was flourishing in spite of the bondage; chap. 2 first told how God providentially provided the deliverer; but now when this deliverer attempted to deliver one of his people, it turned out badly, and he had to flee for his life. This section makes an interesting study in the presumption of the leader, what Christian expositors would rightly describe as trying to do God's work by the flesh. The section has two parts to it: the flight from Egypt over the failed attempt to deliver (vv. 11-15), and the renewed vision of his mission while in Midian (vv. 16-22). <br>
 <a name="fn99" href="exo.htm#fnB99"><sup>39</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:11)  The expression <i>those days</i> refers to the days of bondage.<br>
 <a name="fn100" href="exo.htm#fnB100"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:11)  The preterite with the <i>vav</i> consecutive is here subordinated to the next and main idea of the verse. This is the second use of this verb in the chapter. In v. 10 the verb had the sense of "when he began to grow" or "when he got older"; but here it carries the nuance of "when he had grown up." See <i>IBHS</i> &#167;&#167;485-90.<br>
 <a name="fn101" href="exo.htm#fnB101"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:11)  <i>Heb</i> "brothers."<br>
 <a name="fn102" href="exo.htm#fnB102"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:11)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">har</FONT> (<i>ra'a</i>), "to see," followed by the preposition <i>bet</i> can indicate looking on something as an overseer, or supervising, or investigating. Here the emphasis is on Moses' observing their labor with sympathy or grief. It means more than that he simply saw the way his fellow Hebrews were being treated.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:11)  This journey of Moses to see his people is an indication that he had become aware of his destiny to deliver them. This verse says that he looked on their oppression; the next section will say that the LORD looked on it.<br>
 <a name="fn103" href="exo.htm#fnB103"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:11)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hK#m^</FONT> (<i>makkeh</i>) is the Hiphil participle of the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkn</FONT> (<i>naka</i>). It may be translated "strike, smite, beat, attack." It can be used with the sense of killing (as in the next verse, which says Moses hid the body), but does not necessarily indicate here that the Egyptian killed the Hebrew.<br>
 <a name="fn104" href="exo.htm#fnB104"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:11)  <i>Heb</i> "brothers." This probably does not refer to a literal sibling, or even a relative. More likely it means "fellow Hebrew" here, but to repeat that phrase in the translation at this point would be redundant, so "fellow countrymen" was used instead.<br>
 <a name="fn105" href="exo.htm#fnB105"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:12)  The text literally says, "and he turned thus and thus" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hk)w&#180; hK) /p#Y]w~</FONT> [<i>wayyipen koh wakoh</i>]). It may indicate that he turned his gaze in all directions to ascertain that no one would observe what he did. Or, as Jacobs argues, it may mean that he saw that there was no one to do justice and so he did it himself (<i>Exodus</i>, 37, 38, citing Isa 59:15-16).<br>
 <a name="fn106" href="exo.htm#fnB106"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:12)  <i>Heb</i> "he saw that there was no man."<br>
 <a name="fn107" href="exo.htm#fnB107"><sup>47</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:12)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">EY~w~ </FONT>(<i>wayyak</i>) is from the same root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkn</FONT> (<i>naka</i>), "to smite, attack." The repetition of the verb, especially in Exodus, anticipates the idea of "eye for eye, tooth for tooth." The problem is, however, that Moses was not authorized to take this into his own hands. The question the next day was appropriate: "Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?" The answer? No one--yet.<br>
 <a name="fn108" href="exo.htm#fnB108"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:12)  <i>Heb</i> "him"; for stylistic reasons the referent has been specified as "the body."<br>

 <a name="fn111" href="exo.htm#fnB111"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:13)  The deictic particle is used here to predicate existence, as in "here were" or "there were." But this use of<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> hN}h!</FONT> (<i>hinneh</i>) is intended to indicate also that what he encountered was surprising or sudden--as in "Oh, look!"<br>
 <a name="fn112" href="exo.htm#fnB112"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:13)  The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">uvr</FONT> (<i>rasa')</i> is a legal term, meaning the guilty. Later Pharaoh will declare himself as in the wrong (9:27) and God in the right.

 <a name="fn113" href="exo.htm#fnB113"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:13)  This is the third use of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkn</FONT> (<i>naka</i>) in the passage; here it is the Hiphil imperfect.

 <a name="fn114" href="exo.htm#fnB114"><sup>54</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:13)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;u#r@</FONT> (<i>re'eka</i>) was traditionally translated "your neighbor."

The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rm@{a</FONT> (<i>`omer</i>) is the active participle used verbally; it would literally be "[are you] saying," but in this context it would have the meaning of "thinking, planning."

But the intent of the form is that he said this within himself, and so it means "he thought, realized, said to himself."

 <a name="fn125" href="exo.htm#fnB125"><sup>65</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:15)  The location of Midyan or Midian is uncertain, but it had to have been beyond the Egyptian borders on the east, either in the Sinai or beyond in the Arabah (south of the Dead Sea) or even on the other side of the Gulf of Aqaba. The Midianites seem to have traveled extensively in the desert regions. Cole reasons that since they later were enemies of Israel, it is unlikely that these traditions would have been made up about Israel's great Lawgiver; further, he explains that "Ishmaelite" and "Kenite" might have been clan names within the region of Midian (<i>Exodus</i>, 60). But see, from a different point of view, G. W. Coats, "Moses and Midian," <i>JBL</i> 92 (1973): 3-10.<br>
 <a name="fn126" href="exo.htm#fnB126"><sup>66</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:15)  The verb reads "and he sat" or "and he lived." To translate it "he sat by a well" would seem to be anticlimactic and unconnected. It probably has the same sense as in the last clause, namely, that he lived in Midian, and he lived near a well. <br>
 <a name="fn127" href="exo.htm#fnB127"><sup>67</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:15)  The word has the definite article, "the well." Gesenius lists this use of the article as that which denotes a thing that is yet unknown to the reader but present in the mind under the circumstances (GKC &#167;126.<i>r</i>). Where there was a well, people would settle; and as Cole says it, for people who settled there it was "the well" (<i>Exodus</i>, 60).<br>
 <a name="fn128" href="exo.htm#fnB128"><sup>68</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:16)  The preterites describing their actions must be taken in an ingressive sense, since they did not actually complete the job. Shepherds drove them away, but Moses watered the flocks. <br>
 <a name="fn129" href="exo.htm#fnB129"><sup>69</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:16)  The object "water" is not in the Hebrew text, but is implied.<br>
 <a name="fn130" href="exo.htm#fnB130"><sup>70</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:16)  This also has the ingressive sense.<br>
 <a name="fn131" href="exo.htm#fnB131"><sup>71</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:17)  The definite article here is the generic use; it simply refers to a group of shepherds.<br>
 <a name="fn132" href="exo.htm#fnB132"><sup>72</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:17)  The verb is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;Wvr+g*y+w~</FONT> (<i>waygar<sup>e</sup>sum</i>). Some shepherds came and drove the daughters away. The choice of this verb in the narrative will have a tie with the name of Moses' first son, Gershom. Moses senses very clearly that he is a sojourner in a strange land--he has been driven away.<br>
 <a name="fn133" href="exo.htm#fnB133"><sup>73</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:17)  The verb used here is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/u*v!oYw~</FONT> (<i>wayyosi'an</i>), "and he saved them." The word means that he came to their rescue and delivered them. By the choice of words the narrator is portraying Moses as the deliverer--he is just not yet ready to deliver Israel from its oppressors.<br>
 <a name="fn134" href="exo.htm#fnB134"><sup>74</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:18)  The verb means "to go, to come, to enter." In this context it means that they returned to their father, or came home. <br>
 <a name="fn135" href="exo.htm#fnB135"><sup>75</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:18)  The name Reuel is given here. In other places (e.g., chap. 18) he is called Jethro. Some suggest that this is simply a confusion of traditions. But it is not uncommon for ancients, like Sabaean kings and priests, to have more than one name. Several of the kings of Israel, including Solomon, did. "Reuel" means "friend of God." <br>
 <a name="fn136" href="exo.htm#fnB136"><sup>76</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:18)  The sentence uses a verbal hendiadys construction: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aB) /T#r+h^m! </FONT>(<i>miharten bo'</i>), <i>Heb</i> "you have made quick [to] come." The finite verb becomes an adverb, and the infinitive becomes the main verb of the clause.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:18)  Two observations should be made at this point. First, it seems that the oppression at the well was a regular part of their routine because the father was surprised at their early return, and their answer alluded to the shepherds rather automatically. Secondly, the story forms another meeting-at-the-well account. Continuity with the patriarchs is thereby kept in the mind of the reader. <br>
 <a name="fn137" href="exo.htm#fnB137"><sup>77</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:19)  Continuing the theme of Moses the deliverer, the text now uses another word for salvation, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lxn</FONT> (<i>nasal</i>), "to deliver, rescue" in the sense of plucking out or away, snatching out of danger. <br>
 <a name="fn138" href="exo.htm#fnB138"><sup>78</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:19)  The construction is emphatic with the use of the perfect tense and its infinitive absolute: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hld hld</FONT> (<i>daloh dala</i>). Jacob says, "They showed their enthusiasm through the use of the infinitive absolute--And think of that, <i>he even drew water for us;</i> a man did this for us girls" (<i>Exodus,</i> 41).<br>
 <a name="fn139" href="exo.htm#fnB139"><sup>79</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:20)  <i>Heb</i> "And he said."<br>
 <a name="fn140" href="exo.htm#fnB140"><sup>80</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:20)  The conjunction joins Reuel's question to what the daughters said as logically following with the idea, "If he has done all that you say, why is he not here for me to meet?" (see GKC &#167;154.<i>b</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn141" href="exo.htm#fnB141"><sup>81</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:20)  This uses the demonstrative pronoun as an enclitic, for emphasis (Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;118). The question reads more literally, "Why [is] <i>this</i> [that] you left him?" <br>
 <a name="fn142" href="exo.htm#fnB142"><sup>82</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:20)  The imperfect tense coming after the imperative indicates purpose. <br>
 <a name="fn143" href="exo.htm#fnB143"><sup>83</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:20)  <i>Heb</i> "bread," i.e., "food."<br>
 <a name="fn144" href="exo.htm#fnB144"><sup>84</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:21)  The verb means "and he was willing" to stay with Reuel. The Talmud understood this to mean that he swore; and so when it came time to leave he had to have a word from God and permission from his father-in-law (Exod 4:18-19).<br>
 <a name="fn145" href="exo.htm#fnB145"><sup>85</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:22)  The preterite with the <i>vav</i> consecutive is subordinated to the next clause, which reports the naming and its motivation.<br>
 <a name="fn146" href="exo.htm#fnB146"><sup>86</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:22)  <i>Heb</i> "he called"; the referent (Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn147" href="exo.htm#fnB147"><sup>87</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:22)  Once again a naming with a phonetic word play forms the commemorative summary of the account just provided. Moses seems to have settled into a domestic life with his new wife and his father-in-law. But when the first son is born, he named him <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v)r+G@</FONT> (<i>ger<sup>e</sup>som</i>). There is little information for what the name by itself might have meant; Noth suggests it is related to the Arabic word for "bell" (<i>Personennamen</i>), but there would be little significance to that if true. If it is linked to the verb "drive away" used earlier (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vrg</FONT> [<i>garas</i>]), then the final <i>mem</i> would have to be explained as an enclitic <i>mem</i>. It seems most likely that that verb was used in the narrative to make a secondary word play on the name. The primary explanation is the popular etymology supplied by Moses himself. He links the name to the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rWG</FONT> (<i>gur</i>), "to sojourn, to live as an alien." He then adds that he was a sojourner (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rG@ </FONT>[<i>ger</i>], the participle) in a foreign land. The word "foreign" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hYr!k=n&#180;</FONT> [<i>nokriyya</i>]) adds to the idea of his being a resident alien. The final syllable in the word would then be connected to the adverb "there" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v*</FONT> [<i>sam</i>]). Thus, the name is given the significance in the story of "sojourner there" or "alien there." He no doubt knew that this was not the actual meaning of the name; the name itself had already been introduced into the family of Levi (1 Chr 6:1). He chose the name because its sounds reflected his sentiment at that time. But to what was Moses referring? In view of naming customs of the Semites, he was most likely referring to Midian as the foreign land. If Egypt had been the strange land, and he had now found his place, he would not have given the lad such a name. Personal names reflect the present or recent experiences, or the hope for the future. So this naming is a clear expression by Moses that he knows he is not where he is supposed to be. That this is what he meant is supported in the NT by Stephen (Acts 7:29). So the choice of the name, the explanation of it, and the word play before it, all serve to stress the point that Moses had been driven away from his proper place of service. <br>
 <a name="fn148" href="exo.htm#fnB148"><sup>88</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:23)  The next section of the book is normally referred to as the "Call of Moses," and that is certainly true. But it is much more than that. It is the divine preparation of the servant of God, a servant who already knew what his destiny was. In this section Moses is shown how his destiny will be accomplished. It will be accomplished because the divine presence will guarantee the power, and the promise of that presence comes with the important "I AM" revelation. The message that comes through in this, and other "I will be with you" passages, is that when the promise of God's presence is correctly appropriated by faith, the servant of God can begin to build confidence for the task that lies ahead. It will no longer be, "Who am I that I should go?" but "I AM with you." If the great I AM is working through us, it does not matter who we are. There are several ways that this section can be divided. The first little section, 2:23-25, serves as a transition and introduction, for it records the LORD's response to Israel in her affliction. The second part is the revelation to Moses at the burning bush (3:1-10), which is one of the most significant theological sections in the Torah. Finally, the record of Moses' response to the call with his objections (3:11-22), makes up the third part, and in a way, is a transition to the next section, where God supplies proof of his power.<br>
 <a name="fn149" href="exo.htm#fnB149"><sup>89</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:23)  The verse begins with the temporal indicator "And it was."<br>
 <a name="fn150" href="exo.htm#fnB150"><sup>90</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:23)  <i>Heb</i> "in those many days."<br>
 <a name="fn151" href="exo.htm#fnB151"><sup>91</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:23)  <i>Heb</i> "the children/sons of Israel."<br>
 <a name="fn152" href="exo.htm#fnB152"><sup>92</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:23)  "They cried out" is from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">quz</FONT> (<i>za'aq</i>), but "desperate cry" is from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">uwv</FONT> (<i>sawa'</i>). <br>
 <a name="fn153" href="exo.htm#fnB153"><sup>93</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:24)  The word for this painfully intense "groaning" appears elsewhere to describe a response to having two broken arms (Ezek 30:24).<br>
 <a name="fn154" href="exo.htm#fnB154"><sup>94</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:24)  The two verbs "heard" and "remembered," both preterites, say far more than they seem to say. The verb "to hear" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">umv</FONT> [<i>sama'</i>]) means to respond to what is heard. It can even be found in idiomatic constructions meaning "to obey." To say God heard their complaint means that God responded to it. Likewise, the verb "to remember" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rkz</FONT> [<i>zakar</i>]) means to begin to act on the basis of what is remembered. A prayer to God that says, "Remember me," is asking for more than mere recollection (see B. Childs, <i>Memory and Tradition</i>, 1-8). The structure of this section at the end of the chapter is powerful. There are four descriptions of the Israelites, with a fourfold reaction from God. On the Israelites' side, they groaned (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jna</FONT> [<i>`anah</i>], <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qan </FONT>[<i>na'aq</i>]) and cried out (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">quz</FONT> [<i>za'aq</i>], <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">uwv</FONT> [<i>sawa'</i>]) to God. On the divine side God heard (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">umv</FONT> [<i>sama'</i>]) their groaning, remembered (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rkz</FONT> [<i>zakar</i>]) his covenant, looked (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">har</FONT> [<i>ra'a</i>]) at the Israelites, and took notice (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">udy</FONT> [<i>yada'</i>]) of them. These verbs emphasize God's sympathy and compassion for the people. God is near to those in need; in fact, the deliverer had already been chosen. It is important to note at this point the constant repetition of the word "God." The text is waiting to introduce the name "Yahweh" in a special way.<br>
 <a name="fn155" href="exo.htm#fnB155"><sup>95</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:25)  <i>Heb</i> "And God saw."<br>
 <a name="fn156" href="exo.htm#fnB156"><sup>96</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:25)  The last clause reads "and God knew" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">udy</FONT> [<i>yada'</i>]). The idea seems to be that God took knowledge of, noticed, or regarded them. In other passages the verb "know" is similar in meaning to "save" or "show pity." See especially Gen 18:21, Ps 1:6, and Amos 3:2.<br>
 <a name="fn157" href="exo.htm#fnB157"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:1)  The <i>vav</i> disjunctive with the name "Moses" introduces a new and important starting point. The LORD's dealing with Moses will cover the next two chapters. <br>
 <a name="fn158" href="exo.htm#fnB158"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:1)  Or "west of the desert," taking <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rj^a^</FONT>, "behind," as the opposite of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn}P=-lu^</FONT>, "on the face of, east of" (cf. Gen 25:18).<br>
 <a name="fn159" href="exo.htm#fnB159"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:1)  <i>Horeb</i> is another name for Mount Sinai. This indicates that the area where Moses was living was not east of the Gulf of Aqabah; it also indicates that the people of Midian did move a great deal. There is a good deal of foreshadowing in this verse, for later Moses would shepherd the people of Israel and lead them to Mount Sinai to receive the Law. See D. Skinner, "Some Major Themes of Exodus," <i>Mid-America Theological Journal</i> 1 (1977): 31-42. <br>
 <a name="fn160" href="exo.htm#fnB160"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:2)  The designation "the Angel of the LORD" (<i>Heb</i> "the Angel of Yahweh") occurred in Genesis already (16:7-13; 21:17; 22:11-18). There is some ambiguity in the expression; but it seems often to be interchangeable with God's name itself, indicating that it refers to the LORD. When this is clearly the case, Christian expositors have understood this title to be a reference to the preincarnate appearances of the second person of the trinity. <br>
 <a name="fn161" href="exo.htm#fnB161"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:2)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ar*Y}w~</FONT> (<i>wayyera'</i>) is the Niphal preterite of the verb "to see." For similar examples of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">har</FONT> in Niphal where the subject "appears," that is, allows himself to be seen, or presents himself, see Gen 12:7; 35:9; 46:29; Exod 6:3; and 23:17. Jacob notes in his commentary on Exodus that God appears like this only to individuals and never to masses of people; it is his glory that appears to the masses (<i>Exodus</i>, 49).<br>
 <a name="fn162" href="exo.htm#fnB162"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:2)  Gesenius rightly classifies this as a <i>bet essentiae</i> (par. 119i); it would then indicate that Yahweh appeared to Moses "<i>as</i> a flame."<br>
 <a name="fn163" href="exo.htm#fnB163"><sup>7</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:2)  God chose to reveal through a blazing fire in a thorn bush. The symbolism of fire in the book frequently accompanies the revelation of Yahweh as he delivers Israel, guides her, and purifies her. The description here is unique, calling attention to the manifestation as a flame of fire from within the bush. Philo was the first to interpret the bush as Israel, suffering under the persecution of Egypt but never consumed. The Bible leaves the interpretation open. However, in this revelation the fire is coming from within the bush, not from outside; and it represents the LORD who will deliver his people from persecution. See further E. Levine, "The Evolving Symbolism of the Burning Bush," <i>Dor l<sup>e</sup> Dor</i> 8 (1979): 185-93.<br>
 <a name="fn164" href="exo.htm#fnB164"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:2)  <i>Heb</i> "And he saw."<br>
 <a name="fn165" href="exo.htm#fnB165"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:2)  The text once again uses the deictic particle with the <i>vav</i>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hN}h!w+</FONT> (<i>w<sup>e</sup>hinneh</i>), traditionally (and archaically) rendered "and behold." The particle goes with the intense gaze, the outstretched arm, the raised eyebrow--excitement and intense interest: "look, over there." It draws the reader into the immediate experience of the subject.<br>
 <a name="fn166" href="exo.htm#fnB166"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:2)  The construction uses the suffixed negative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WNn\ya@</FONT> (<i>`enennu</i>) to convey the subject of the passive verb: "it was not" consumed. This was the amazing thing, for nothing would burn faster in the desert than a thornbush on fire.<br>
 <a name="fn167" href="exo.htm#fnB167"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:3)  <i>Heb</i> "And Moses said." The implication is that Moses said this to himself.<br>
 <a name="fn168" href="exo.htm#fnB168"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:3)  The construction uses the cohortative <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aN&#180;-hr*s%a* </FONT>(<i>`asura-nna'</i>) followed by an imperfect with <i>vav</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ha#r+a#w+</FONT> [<i>w<sup>e</sup>'er'eh</i>]) to express the purpose or result (logical sequence): "I will turn aside in order that I may see."<br>
 <a name="fn169" href="exo.htm#fnB169"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:3)  <i>Heb</i> "great." The word means something extraordinary here. But in using this term Moses revealed his reaction to the strange sight and his anticipation that something special was about to happen. So he turned away from the flock to investigate it.<br>
 <a name="fn170" href="exo.htm#fnB170"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:3)  The verb is an imperfect tense; here it has the progressive nuance--why the bush is not burning up.<br>
 <a name="fn171" href="exo.htm#fnB171"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:4)  The preterite with the <i>vav</i> is subordinated as a temporal clause to the main point of the verse, that God called to him. The language is anthropomorphic, as if God's actions were based on his observing what Moses did.<br>
 <a name="fn172" href="exo.htm#fnB172"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:4)  The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> (<i>ki</i>) after the verb "see" introduces a noun clause that functions as the direct object of the verb (Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;490).<br>
 <a name="fn173" href="exo.htm#fnB173"><sup>17</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:4)  The repetition of the name in God's call is emphatic, making the appeal direct and immediate (see also Gen 22:11; 46:2). The use of the personal name shows how specifically God directed the call and that he knew this person. The repetition may have stressed even more that it was indeed he whom the LORD wanted. It would have been an encouragement to Moses that this was in fact the LORD who was meeting him. <br>
 <a name="fn174" href="exo.htm#fnB174"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:4)  <i>Heb</i> "And he said"; the referent (Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn175" href="exo.htm#fnB175"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:5)  <i>Heb</i> "And he"; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn176" href="exo.htm#fnB176"><sup>20</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:5)  Even though the LORD was drawing near to Moses, Moses could not simply approach him. There still was a barrier between God and human, and God had to remind Moses of this with instructions. The removal of the sandals was, and still is in the East, a sign of humility and reverence in the presence of the Holy One. It was a way of excluding the dust and dirt of the world. But it also took away personal comfort and convenience, and brought the person more closely in contact with the earth. <br>
 <a name="fn177" href="exo.htm#fnB177"><sup>21</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:5)  The word "holy" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vd#q)</FONT> [<i>qodes</i>]) indicates "set apart, distinct, unique." What made a mountain or other place holy was the fact that God chose that place to reveal himself, or to reside among his people. Because God was in this place, the ground was different--it was holy. <br>
 <a name="fn178" href="exo.htm#fnB178"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:5)  The causal clause includes within it a typical relative clause, which is made up of the relative pronoun, then the independent personal pronoun with the participle, and then the preposition with the resumptive pronoun. It would literally be, "which you are standing on it"; but the relative pronoun and the resumptive pronoun are combined and rendered, "on which you are standing."<br>
 <a name="fn179" href="exo.htm#fnB179"><sup>23</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:6)  This self-revelation by Yahweh prepares for the revelation of the holy name. While no verb is used here, the pronoun and the predicate nominative is a construction used throughout Scripture to reflect the "I AM" disclosures--"I [am] the God of...." But the significant point here is the naming of the patriarchs, for this God is the covenant God, who will now begin to fulfill his promises. <br>
 <a name="fn180" href="exo.htm#fnB180"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:6)  The clause uses the Hiphil infinitive construct with a preposition after the perfect tense: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">fyB!h^m@ ar}y&#180;</FONT> (<i>yare' mehabbit</i>), "he was afraid from gazing," meaning "he was afraid to gaze." The preposition <i>min</i> is used before infinitives after verbs like the one in this text, and functions to tell what he feared (completes the verb; see BDB p. 583, 7b).<br>
 <a name="fn181" href="exo.htm#fnB181"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:7)  The use of the infinitive absolute with the perfect tense intensifies the statement: I have surely seen--there is no doubt that I have seen and will do something about it.<br>
 <a name="fn182" href="exo.htm#fnB182"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:7)  Two new words are introduced now to the report of suffering: "affliction" and "pain/suffering." These add to the dimension of the oppression of God's people. <br>
 <a name="fn183" href="exo.htm#fnB183"><sup>27</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:8)  The text uses the preterite verb "and I came down." God's coming down is a frequent anthropomorphism in Genesis and Exodus; it expresses his direct involvement, often in the sense of judgment.<br>
 <a name="fn184" href="exo.htm#fnB184"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:8)  The Hiphil<i> </i>infinitive with the suffix is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">olyX!h^l= </FONT>(<i>l<sup>e</sup>hassilo</i>), "to deliver them."<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> </FONT>It expresses the purpose of God's coming down. The verb itself is used for delivering or rescuing in the general sense, and snatching out of danger for the specific.<br>
 <a name="fn185" href="exo.htm#fnB185"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:8)  <i>Heb</i> "into a good and large land." In the translation the order has been revised and the word "both" supplied because in contemporary English "good and" combined with any additional descriptive term can be understood as elative ("good and large" = "very large"; "good and spacious" = "very spacious," etc.). The point made in the Hebrew text is that the land to which they are going is both good (in terms of quality) and large (in terms of size).<br>
 <a name="fn186" href="exo.htm#fnB186"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:8)  This vibrant and extravagant description of the promised land is a familiar one. Gesenius classifies "milk and honey" as epexegetical genitives because they provide more precise description following a verbal adjective in the construct state (GKC &#167;128.<i>x</i>). The land is modified by "flowing," and "flowing" is explained by the genitives "milk and honey." These two products will be in abundance in the land, and they therefore represent the abundant land. The language is hyperbolic, as if the land were streaming with these products.<br>
 <a name="fn187" href="exo.htm#fnB187"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:8)  Each people group is joined to the preceding by the <i>vav</i> conjunction, "and." Each also has the definite article, as in other similar lists (3:17; 13:5; 34:11). To repeat the conjunction and article in the English translation seems to put more weight on the list than is necessary to its function in identifying what land God was giving the Israelites.<br>
 <a name="fn188" href="exo.htm#fnB188"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:9)  The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hN}h!</FONT> focuses attention on what is being said.<br>
 <a name="fn189" href="exo.htm#fnB189"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:9)  The word is a technical term for the outcry one might make to a judge. God had seen the oppression and so knew that the complaints were accurate, and so he initiated the proceedings against the oppressors (Jacob, p. 59).<br>
 <a name="fn190" href="exo.htm#fnB190"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:9)  <i>Heb</i> "seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them." The word for the oppression is now <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jj^l^</FONT> (<i>lahas</i>), which has the idea of pressure with the oppression--squeezing, pressuring--which led to its later use in the Semitic languages for torture. The repetition in the Hebrew text of the root in the participle form after this noun serves to emphasize the idea in the sentence. This emphasis has been represented in the translation by the expression "seen how severely the Egyptians oppress them."<br>
 <a name="fn191" href="exo.htm#fnB191"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:10)  The verse has a sequence of volitives. The first form is the imperative "go" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hk*l=</FONT> [<i>l<sup>e</sup>ka</i>]); this is followed by the cohortative/imperfect form with the <i>vav</i>, "and I will send you" or more likely "that I may send you" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;j&amp;l*v=a#w+</FONT> [<i>w<sup>e</sup>'eslahaka</i>]), which is followed by the imperative with the <i>vav</i>, "and bring out" or "that you may bring out" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ax@ohw+</FONT> [<i>w<sup>e</sup>hose'</i>]). The series of actions begins with Moses going. When he goes, it will be the LORD who sends him, and if the LORD sends him, it will be with the purpose of leading Israel out of Egypt.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:10)  These instructions for Moses are based on the preceding revelation made to him. The deliverance of Israel was to be God's work--hence, "I will send you." When God commissioned people, often using the verb "to send," it indicated that they went with his backing, his power, and his authority. Moses could not have brought Israel out without this. To name this incident a commissioning, then, means that the authority came from God to do the work (compare John 3:2).<br>

 <a name="fn193" href="exo.htm#fnB193"><sup>37</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:11)  When he was younger, Moses was confident and impulsive; but now that he is older the greatness of the task makes him unsure. The following narratives, the third section of the chapter and the next chapter, record the four difficulties of Moses and how the LORD answers them (11-12, 13-22; then 4:1-9; and finally 4:10-17). <br>
 <a name="fn194" href="exo.htm#fnB194"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:11)  The imperfect tense <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">El@a@</FONT> (<i>`elek</i>) carries the modal nuance of obligatory imperfect, i.e., "that I should go." Moses at this point is overwhelmed with the task of representing God, and with his insufficiency, and so in honest humility questions the choice.<br>
 <a name="fn195" href="exo.htm#fnB195"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:12)  <i>Heb</i> "And he said"; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn196" href="exo.htm#fnB196"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:12)  The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK!</FONT> (<i>ki</i>) has the asseverative use here, "surely, indeed," which is frequently found with oaths (Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;449). The imperfect tense <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hy\h=a#</FONT> (<i>`ehyeh</i>) could be rendered as the future tense, "I will be," or the present tense "I am" with you. The future makes the better sense in the passage since the subject matter is the future mission. But since it is a stative verb, the form will also lend itself nicely to explaining the divine name--he is the One who is eternally present--"I am with you always."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:12)  Here is the introduction of the main motif of the commission, which will be the explanation of the divine name. It will make little difference who the servant is or what that servant's abilities might be, if God is present. It is this presence that overcomes the world. It is not a simple catch-phrase; it represents abundant provisions to the believer (see below on v. 14).<br>
 <a name="fn197" href="exo.htm#fnB197"><sup>41</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:12)  In view of Moses' hesitancy, a sign is necessary to prove the promise. A sign is often an unusual or miraculous event that introduces, authenticates, or illustrates the message. One expects a direct connection between the sign and the message (for a helpful discussion, see S. Porubcan, "The Word `OT in Isaia 7,14," <i>CBQ</i> 22 [1960]: 144-49). In this passage the sign is a confirming one, i.e., when Israel worships at the mountain that will be the proof that God delivered them from Egypt. Thus, the purpose of the exodus that makes possible the worship will be to prove that it was God who brought it about. In the meantime, Moses will have to trust in Yahweh. <br>
 <a name="fn198" href="exo.htm#fnB198"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:12)  The verb "you will serve" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/Wdb=u^T^</FONT> [<i>ta'abdun</i>]) is one of the foremost words for worship in the Torah. Keeping the commandments and serving Yahweh usually sum up the life of faith; the true worshiper seeks to obey him. The highest title anyone can have in the OT is "the servant of Yahweh." The verb here could be rendered interpretively as "worship," but it is better to keep it to the basic idea of serving because that emphasizes a very important aspect of worship. The subject of the verb is plural (Moses and the people), unlike the other second person forms in vv. 10 and 12, which are singular.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:12)  This sign is also a promise from God--"you will serve God on this mountain." It is given to Moses here as a goal, but a goal already achieved because it was a sign from God. Leading Israel out of Egypt would not be completed until they came to this mountain and served God. God does not give Moses details of what will take place on the road to Sinai; but he does give him the goal and glimpses of the defeat of Pharaoh. The rest will require Moses and the people to trust in this God who had a plan and who had the power to carry it out. <br>
 <a name="fn199" href="exo.htm#fnB199"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:13)  <i>Heb</i> "And Moses said."<br>
 <a name="fn200" href="exo.htm#fnB200"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:13)  The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hN}h!</FONT> (<i>hinneh</i>) in this clause introduces the foundation for what comes later--the question. Moses is saying, "Suppose I do all this and they ask this question--what should I say?" <br>
 <a name="fn201" href="exo.htm#fnB201"><sup>45</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:13)  There has been considerable debate about the name of Yahweh in the Pentateuch, primarily because of the source critical approach that tried to argue that the name Yahweh was not known in antiquity. The argument of this whole section nullifies that view. The idea that God's name was revealed only here raises the question of what he was called earlier. The word "God" is not a name. "El Shaddai" is used only a few times in Genesis. But Israel would not have had a nameless deity--especially since we are told from the very beginning that people were making proclamation of the name of Yahweh (Gen 4:26; 12:8). It is possible that they did not always need a name if they were convinced that only he existed and there was no other God. But probably what Moses was anticipating was the Israelites wanting to be sure that Moses came from their God, and that some sign could prove it. They would have known his name (Yahweh), and they would have known the ways that he had manifested himself. It would do no good for Moses to come with a new name for God, for that would be like introducing them to a new God. That would in no way authenticate his call to them, only confuse; after all, they would not be expecting a new name--they had been praying to their covenant God all along. They would want to be sure that their covenant God actually had sent Moses. To satisfy the Israelites Moses would have had to have been familiar with the name Yahweh--as they were--and know that he appeared to individuals. They would also want to know if Yahweh had sent Moses, how this was going to work in their deliverance, because they had been crying to him for deliverance. As it turned out, the Israelites had less problem with this than Moses anticipated--they were delighted when he came. It is likely that much of this concern was Moses' own need for assurance that this was indeed the God of the fathers and that the promised deliverance was now to take place. See the discussions of this passage in the commentaries on Exodus by Benno Jacob and Umberto Cassuto.<br>
 <a name="fn202" href="exo.htm#fnB202"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:13)  The imperfect tense here has been given a deliberative nuance, for Moses is wondering what he should say when the Israelites want proof of the calling.<br>
 <a name="fn203" href="exo.htm#fnB203"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:14)  The verb form used here is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hy\h=a#</FONT> (<i>`ehyeh</i>), the Qal imperfect, 1csg, of the verb "to be," <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hyh</FONT> (<i>haya</i>). It forms an excellent paronomasia with the name. So when God used the verb to express his name, he used this form saying, "I AM." When his people refer to him as Yahweh, which is the 3msg form of the same verb, it actually means "he is." Some commentators argue for a future tense translation, "I will be who I will be," because the verb has an active quality about it, and the Israelites lived in the light of the promises for the future. They argue that "I AM" would be of little help to the Israelites in bondage. But a translation of "I will be" does not effectively do much more except restrict it to the future. The idea of the verb would certainly indicate that God is not bound by time, and while he is present ("I AM") he will always be present, even in the future, and so the verb would embrace that as well. Besides, the prophetic writers often give the significance of the names with the use of timeless pronouns--"I [am] he, there is no one else" (see Isa 44:6 and 45:5-7, et al). The Greek translation used a participle to capture the idea; and several times in the Gospels Jesus used the powerful "I am" with this OT significance. The simplest meaning is the English present tense, which embraces the future promises. The point is that Yahweh is sovereignly independent of all creation and that his presence guarantees the fulfillment of the covenant. Others argue for a causative Hiphil translation of "I will cause to be," but nowhere in the Bible does this verb appear in Hiphil or Piel<i>. </i>For a full discussion there are a number of works available. A good summary of the views can be found in G. H. Park-Taylor, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"><i>hwhy</i></FONT> , <i>Yahweh, the Divine Name in the Bible</i> (Waterloo, Ontario, 1975).

 <a name="fn204" href="exo.htm#fnB204"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:14)  Or "Thus you shall say" (also in the following verse). The word "must" in the translation conveys the instructional and imperatival force of the statement.<br>
 <a name="fn205" href="exo.htm#fnB205"><sup>49</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:15)  <i>Heb</i> "Yahweh," traditionally rendered "the LORD." The paronomasia on the name was first used to give the full meaning of the name. Now the actual name is used for clear identification: "Yahweh...has sent me." This is the name that the patriarchs invoked and proclaimed in the land of Canaan. <br>
 <a name="fn206" href="exo.htm#fnB206"><sup>50</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:15)  The words "name" and "memorial" are at the heart of the two parallel clauses that form a poetic pair. The Hebrew word "remembrance" is a poetical synonym for "name"; it conveys the idea that the nature or character of the person is to be remembered and praised (Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, p. 24). <br>
 <a name="fn207" href="exo.htm#fnB207"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:15)  The repetition of "generation" in this expression serves as a periphrasis for the superlative: "to the remotest generation" (GKC &#167;133.<i>l</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn208" href="exo.htm#fnB208"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:16)  The form is the perfect tense with the sequential <i>vav</i> linking the nuance to the imperative that precedes it.

 <a name="fn209" href="exo.htm#fnB209"><sup>53</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:16)  "The God of your fathers" is in simple apposition to the name "the LORD" (<i>Heb</i> "Yahweh") as a recognizable identification. If the holy name were a new one to the Israelites, an explanation would have been needed.<br>
 <a name="fn210" href="exo.htm#fnB210"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:16)  The form is the Niphal perfect of the verb "to see." See the note on "appeared" in 3:20.<br>
 <a name="fn211" href="exo.htm#fnB211"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:16)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dqP</FONT> (<i>paqad</i>) has traditionally been rendered "to visit." This does not communicate the point of the word very well. When God "visited" someone, it meant that he intervened in their lives to change their circumstances or their destiny. When he visited the Amalekites, he destroyed them (1 Sam 15:2). When he visited Sarah, he provided the long awaited child (Gen 21:1). It refers to God's active involvement in human affairs for blessing or for cursing. Here it would mean that God had begun to act to deliver the Israelites from bondage and give them the blessings of the covenant. The form is joined here with the infinitive absolute to underscore the certainty--"I have indeed visited you." Some translate it "remember"; others say "watch over." These do not capture the idea of intervention to bless, and often with the idea of vengeance or judgment on the oppressors. If God were to visit what the Egyptians did, it means that he would stop the oppression and that he would also bring retribution for it. The nuance of the perfect tense could be a perfect of resolve ("I have decided to visit"), or an instantaneous perfect ( "I hereby visit"), or a prophetic perfect ("I have visited" = "I will visit"). The infinitive absolute reinforces the statement (so "carefully"), the rendering "attended to" attempts to convey the ideas of personal presence, mental awareness, and action, as when a nurse or physician "attends" a patient.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:16)  The same word was used in the same kind of construction at the end of Genesis (50:24) when Joseph promised, "God will surely visit you" (but there the imperfect tense with the infinitive absolute). Here is another link to the patriarchal narratives. This work of Moses would be interpreted as a fulfillment of Joseph's prophecy. <br>
 <a name="fn212" href="exo.htm#fnB212"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:16)  To say that God has visited the oppression (or "attended to" it) means that God has decided to judge the oppressing people as he blesses Israel. <br>

This expression (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hq*z*j&amp; dy&#180;B= aOw+</FONT> [<i>w<sup>e</sup>lo' b<sup>e</sup>yad hazaqa</i>]) is unclear. Some have taken it to refer to God's mighty hand, meaning that the king would not let them go unless a mighty hand compels them (NIV). The expression "mighty hand" is used of God's rescuing Israel elsewhere (6:1, 13:9, 32:11). This idea is a rather general interpretation of the words; it owes much to the LXX, which has "except by a mighty hand." Another difficulty is that the next verse says that God will stretch out his hand and do his wonders. In view of these difficulties with the Hebrew text, others have suggested that it would mean "strong [threats]" from the Israelites (as in 4:24ff. and 5:3) (Jacob, p. 81). This does not seem as convincing as the first view. It may be that textual criticism could uncover the original which might have had <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aO &lt;a!w+</FONT> (if not) instead of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aOw+</FONT>.

At the hesitancy of Moses, God guarantees his presence will be with him, and that assures the success of the mission. But with chap. 4, the second half of the call, the tone changes sharply. Now Moses protests his inadequacies in view of the nature of the task. In many ways, these verses address the question, "Who is sufficient for these things?" There are three basic movements in the passage. The first nine verses tell how God gave Moses signs in case Israel did not believe him (4:1-9). The second section records how God dealt with the speech problem of Moses (4:10-12). And finally, the last section records God's provision of a helper, someone who could talk well (4:13-17).

The Hebrew words traditionally rendered "leprous" or "leprosy," as they are used in Lev 13 and 14, encompass a variety of conditions, not limited to the disease called leprosy and identified as Hansen's disease in modern times.<br>

 <a name="fn251" href="exo.htm#fnB251"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:9)  The verb form is the perfect tense with the <i>vav</i> consecutive; it functions then as the equivalent of the imperfect tense--here as an imperfect of instruction. <br>
 <a name="fn252" href="exo.htm#fnB252"><sup>21</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:9)  This is a powerful sign, for the Nile was always known as the source of life in Egypt, but now it will become the evidence of death. So the three signs were alike, each consisting of life and death. They would clearly anticipate the struggle with Egypt through the plagues. The point is clear in the face of the possibility that people might not believe: the servants of God must offer clear proof of the power of God as they deliver the message of God. The rest is up to God. <br>
 <a name="fn253" href="exo.htm#fnB253"><sup>22</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:10)  Now Moses took up another line of argumentation, the issue of his inability to speak fluently (vv. 10-17). The point here is that God's servants must yield themselves as instruments to God, the Creator. It makes no difference what character traits they have or what weaknesses they think they have (Moses manages to speak very well) if God is present. If the sovereign God has chosen them, then they have everything that God intended them to have. <br>
 <a name="fn254" href="exo.htm#fnB254"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:10)  The form is a particle of entreaty; it seeks permission to speak and is always followed by "Lord" or "my Lord." <br>
 <a name="fn255" href="exo.htm#fnB255"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:10)  The designation in Moses' address is "my Lord" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn&#180;d)a&amp;</FONT> [<i>`adonay</i>])--the term for "lord, master" but pointed as it would be when it represents the tetragrammaton. Jacob says since this is the first time Moses spoke directly to Yahweh he did so hesitatingly (<i>Exodus, </i>p. 87).<br>
 <a name="fn256" href="exo.htm#fnB256"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:10)  When a noun clause is negated with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aO</FONT> (<i>lo'</i>), rather than <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ya@</FONT>, there is a special emphasis since the force of the negative falls on a specific word (GKC &#167;152.<i>d</i>). The expression "eloquent man" is literally <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yr!b*D+ vya!</FONT> (<i>`is d<sup>e</sup>barim</i>), "a man of words." The genitive may indicate a man characterized by words or a man who is able to command or control words. Moses apparently is resigned to the fact that he can do the signs; but he knows the signs have to be explained.<br>
 <a name="fn257" href="exo.htm#fnB257"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:10)  The two expressions are <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hP#-db^k=</FONT> (<i>k<sup>e</sup>bad peh</i>), "heavy of mouth," and then <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ovl* db^k=</FONT> (<i>k<sup>e</sup>bad lason</i>), "heavy of tongue." Both use genitives of specification, the mouth and the tongue being what are heavy--slow. "Mouth" and "tongue" are metonymies of cause. Moses is saying that he has a problem speaking well. Perhaps he had been too long at the other side of the desert, or perhaps he was being a little dishonest. At any rate, he has still not captured the meaning of God's presence. See among other works, Jeffrey H. Tigay, "`Heavy of Mouth' and `Heavy of Tongue' on Moses' Speech Difficulty," <i>BASOR</i> 231 (1978): 57-67. <br>
 <a name="fn258" href="exo.htm#fnB258"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:11)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yc!</FONT> (<i>sim</i>) means "to place, put, set"; the sentence here more precisely says, "Who put a mouth into a man?"<br>
 <b>sn</b> (4:11)  The argumentation by Moses is here met by Yahweh's rhetorical questions. It is intended to be sharp--it is reproof for Moses. The message is twofold. First, Yahweh is fully able to overcome all of Moses' deficiencies. Second, Moses is exactly the way that God intended him to be. So the rhetorical questions are meant to prod Moses' faith. <br>
 <a name="fn259" href="exo.htm#fnB259"><sup>28</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:11)  The final question obviously demands a positive answer. But the clause is worded in such a way as to return to the theme of "I AM." Isaiah developed this same idea of God's control over life: "I am the LORD [<i>Heb</i> "Yahweh"]. There is no other God. I form the light and create the darkness; I kill and I make alive" (cf. Isa 45:5-7). Moses protests that he is not an eloquent speaker, and the LORD [<i>Heb</i> "Yahweh"] answers, "I Am"--not only "I am the LORD" but "I am a powerful speaker"--"I will be with your mouth."<br>
 <a name="fn260" href="exo.htm#fnB260"><sup>29</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:12)  The promise of divine presence always indicates intervention (for blessing or cursing). Here it means that God would be working through the organs of speech to help Moses speak. See Deut 18:18; Jer 1:9. <br>
 <a name="fn261" href="exo.htm#fnB261"><sup>30</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:12)  The verb is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;yt!yr@ohw+</FONT> (<i>w<sup>e</sup>horetika</i>), the Hiphil perfect with a <i>vav</i> consecutive. The form carries the instructional meaning because it follows the imperative with a <i>vav</i> formation. In fact, there is a sequence at work here: "go...and/that I may teach you." It is from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hry</FONT> (<i>yara</i>), the same root behind <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hr&#180;oT</FONT> (<i>tora</i>), "law." This always referred to teaching either wisdom or revelation. Here Yahweh promises to teach Moses what to say. <br>
 <a name="fn262" href="exo.htm#fnB262"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:12)  The form is the imperfect tense. While it could be taken as a future ("what you will say"), an obligatory imperfect captures the significance better ("what you must say" or "what you are to say"). Not even the content of the message will be left up to Moses.<br>
 <a name="fn263" href="exo.htm#fnB263"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:13)  <i>Heb</i> "And he said"; the referent (Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>

This is not Moses' resignation to doing God's will--it is his final attempt to avoid the call. It carries the force of asking God to send someone else. This is an example of an independent relative clause governed by the genitive: "by the hand of--whom you will send" (see GKC &#167;155.<i>n</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn266" href="exo.htm#fnB266"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:14)  <i>Heb</i> "and the anger of Yahweh burned against."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (4:14)  Moses had not dared openly to say "except me" when he asked God to send whomever he wanted to send. But God knew that is what he meant. Moses should not have resisted the call, or pleaded such excuses, or hesitated with such weak faith. Now God abandoned the gentle answer and in anger brought in a form of retribution. Because Moses did not want to do this, he was punished by not having the honor of doing it alone. His reluctance and the result are like the refusal of Israel to enter the land and the result they experienced (see U. Cassuto, <i>Commentary on Exodus,</i> pp. 49-50).<br>
 <a name="fn267" href="exo.htm#fnB267"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:14)  <i>Heb</i> "Is not" or perhaps "Is [there] not."<br>
 <a name="fn268" href="exo.htm#fnB268"><sup>37</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:14)  Driver suggests that the term "Levite" may refer to a profession rather than ancestry here, because both Moses and Aaron were from the tribe of Levi and there would be little point in noting that ancestry for Aaron. In thinking through the difficult problem of the identity of Levites, he cites McNeile as saying "the Levite" referred to one who had had official training as a priest (cf. Judg 17:7, where a member of the tribe of Judah was a Levite). And if it was the duty of the priest to give "tora"--to teach--then some training in the power of language would have been in order (<i>Exodus</i>, p. 29). <br>
 <a name="fn269" href="exo.htm#fnB269"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:14)  The construction uses the Piel infinitive absolute and the Piel<i> </i>imperfect to express the idea that he spoke very well: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rB@d^y+ rB@d^</FONT> (<i>dabber y<sup>e</sup>dabber).</i><br>
 <b>sn</b> (4:14) <i> </i>Now Yahweh, in condescending to Moses, selects something that Moses (and God) did not really need for the work. It is as if he is saying: "If Moses feels speaking ability is so necessary (rather than the divine presence), then that is what he will have." Of course, this golden-tongued Aaron had some smooth words about how the golden calf was forged! <br>
 <a name="fn270" href="exo.htm#fnB270"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:14)  The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hN}h!</FONT> (<i>hinneh</i>) with the participle points to the imminent future; it means "he is about to come" or "here he is coming." <br>
 <a name="fn271" href="exo.htm#fnB271"><sup>40</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:14)  It is unlikely that this simply means as a brother he will be pleased to see Moses, for the narrative has no time for that kind of comment. It is interested in more significant things. Here he will rejoice because of the revelation of God to Moses and the plan to deliver Israel from bondage (see Jacob, p. 93). <br>
 <a name="fn272" href="exo.htm#fnB272"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:15)  Or "I will help you speak." The independent pronoun puts emphasis ("as for me") on the subject ("I").<br>

 <a name="fn274" href="exo.htm#fnB274"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:15)  The word "both" is supplied to convey that this object ("you") and the subject of the next verb ("you must do") are plural in the Hebrew text, referring to Moses and Aaron.

 <a name="fn275" href="exo.htm#fnB275"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:15)  The imperfect tense carries the obligatory nuance here as well. The relative pronoun with this verb forms a noun clause functioning as the direct object of "I will teach." <br>
 <a name="fn276" href="exo.htm#fnB276"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:16)  The independent pronoun makes the subject emphatic, as if to say, "he is the one who will speak for you."<br>

 <a name="fn280" href="exo.htm#fnB280"><sup>49</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:16)  It is as if Moses would be a god, or God, to Aaron, giving him the words to say, inspiring him as God would inspire a prophet. The whole process had now been removed one step. Instead of God speaking to Moses and Moses telling the people, Aaron would be the speaker for a while. But God was still going to work through Moses. <br>
 <a name="fn281" href="exo.htm#fnB281"><sup>50</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:17)  This is an appropriate ending to the section, for it would be God's power (represented by the rod) working through Moses. The applicable point that this whole section is making could be worded this way: the servants of God who sense their inadequacy must demonstrate the power of God as their sufficiency. <br>
 <a name="fn282" href="exo.htm#fnB282"><sup>51</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:18)  This last section of the chapter reports Moses' compliance with the commission. It has four parts to it: the decision to return (18-20), the instruction (21-23), the confrontation with Yahweh (24-26), and the presentation with Aaron (27-31). <br>
 <a name="fn283" href="exo.htm#fnB283"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:18)  The two verbs form a verbal hendiadys, the second verb becoming adverbial in the translation: "and he went and he returned" becomes "and he went back."<br>
 <a name="fn284" href="exo.htm#fnB284"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:18)  There is a sequence here with the two cohortative forms: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb*Wva*w+ an&#180;-hk*l=a@</FONT> (<i>`el<sup>e</sup>ka-na' w<sup>e</sup>'asuba</i>)--"let me go <i>in order that I may</i> return."<br>

 <a name="fn286" href="exo.htm#fnB286"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:18)  This verb is parallel to the preceding cohortative and so also expresses purpose: "let me go that I may return...and that I may see."<br>
 <a name="fn287" href="exo.htm#fnB287"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:19)  The text has two imperatives, "Go, return"; if these are interpreted as a hendiadys (as in the translation), then the second is adverbial.<br>
 <a name="fn288" href="exo.htm#fnB288"><sup>57</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:19)  The text clearly stated that Pharaoh sought to kill Moses; so this must be a reference to Pharaoh's death. This might provide another bit of the puzzle. Moses was forty years in Midian. Only Pharaoh Thutmose III reigned that long in the 18th dynasty (1504-1450 B.C.). Clearly, from the text, the pharaoh from whom Moses fled is the pharaoh that died, enabling Moses to return. This would place Moses' returning to Egypt approximately 1450 B.C. in the beginning of the reign of Amenhotep II, whom most conservatives would identify as the pharaoh of the Exodus. Rameses II, of course, reigned that long. But if he were the one from whom Moses fled, then he could not be the pharaoh of the exodus, but his son would be--and that puts the date of the exodus after 1236, a date too late for anyone. See E. H. Merrill, <i>Kingdom of Priests</i>, p. 62.<br>
 <a name="fn289" href="exo.htm#fnB289"><sup>58</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:20)  <i>Heb</i> "And Moses took."<br>
 <a name="fn290" href="exo.htm#fnB290"><sup>59</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:20)  Only Gershom has been mentioned so far. The other son's name will be explained in chap. 18. The explanation of Gershom's name was important to Moses' sojourn in Midian. The explanation of the name Eliezer fits better in the later chapter (18:2-4). <br>
 <a name="fn291" href="exo.htm#fnB291"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:20)  The verb would literally be rendered "and returned"; however, the narrative will record other happenings before he arrived in Egypt, so an ingressive nuance fits here--he began to return, or started back.<br>

 <a name="fn293" href="exo.htm#fnB293"><sup>62</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:21)  The construction may involve a verbal hendiadys using the two infinitive forms: "when you go to return" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bWvl* ;T=k=l#B=</FONT> [<i>b<sup>e</sup>lekt<sup>e</sup>ka lasub</i>]). The clause is temporal, subordinated to the instruction to do the signs. Therefore, its focus cannot be on going to return, i.e., preparing or beginning to return. <br>
 <a name="fn294" href="exo.htm#fnB294"><sup>63</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:21)  The two verb forms in this section are the imperative (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ha@r+</FONT> [<i>r<sup>e</sup>'eh</i>]) followed by the perfect with the <i>vav</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;t*yc!u&amp;w~</FONT> [<i>wa'asitam</i>]). The second could be coordinated and function as a second command: "see...and [then] do"; or it could be subordinated logically: "see...so that you do." Some commentators who take the first option suggest that Moses was supposed to contemplate these wonders before doing them before Pharaoh. That does not seem as likely as the second interpretation reflected in the translation.<br>
 <a name="fn295" href="exo.htm#fnB295"><sup>64</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:21)  Or "in your power"; <i>Heb</i> "in your hand."<br>
 <a name="fn296" href="exo.htm#fnB296"><sup>65</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:21)  <i>Heb</i> "strengthen" (in the sense of making stubborn or obstinate).

 <a name="fn297" href="exo.htm#fnB297"><sup>66</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:21)  Here is the first mention of the hardening of the heart of Pharaoh. God first tells Moses he must do the miracles, but then he announces that he will harden Pharaoh's heart, as if working against Moses. It will help Moses to know that God is bringing about the resistance in order to bring a greater victory with greater glory. There is a great deal of literature on this; but see among the resources F. W. Danker, "Hardness of Heart: A Study in Biblical Thematic," <i>CTM</i> 44 (1973): 89-100; and R. R. Wilson, "The Hardening of Pharaoh's Heart," <i>CBQ</i> 41 (1979): 18-36.<br>
 <a name="fn298" href="exo.htm#fnB298"><sup>67</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:21)  Or "so that."<br>
 <a name="fn299" href="exo.htm#fnB299"><sup>68</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:22)  The sequence of the instruction from God uses the perfect tense with <i>vav</i>, following the preceding imperfects.<br>
 <a name="fn300" href="exo.htm#fnB300"><sup>69</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:22)  The instantaneous use of the perfect tense fits well with the prophetic announcement of what Yahweh said or says. It shows that the words given to the prophet are still binding.<br>
 <a name="fn301" href="exo.htm#fnB301"><sup>70</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:22)  The metaphor uses the word "son" in its connotation of a political dependent. It can mean a literal son, a descendant, a chosen king (and so, the Messiah), a disciple (in Proverbs), and here, a nation subject to God. If the people of Israel were God's "son," then they should serve him and not Pharaoh. Malachi reminds people that the Law said "a son honors his father"; and so God asked, "If I am a father, where is my honor?" (Mal 1:6).<br>
 <a name="fn302" href="exo.htm#fnB302"><sup>71</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:23)  The text uses the imperative, "send out" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jL^v^</FONT> [<i>sallah</i>] followed by the imperfect or jussive with the <i>vav</i> to express purpose.<br>
 <a name="fn303" href="exo.htm#fnB303"><sup>72</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:23)  The Piel infinitive serves as the direct object of the verb, answering the question of what Pharaoh would refuse to do. The command and refusal to obey are the grounds for the announcement of death for Pharaoh's son.<br>
 <a name="fn304" href="exo.htm#fnB304"><sup>73</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:23)  The construction is very emphatic. The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hN}h!</FONT> (<i>hinneh</i>) gives it an immediacy and a vividness, as if God is already beginning to act. The participle with this particle gives the nuance of an imminent future act, as if God is saying, "I am about to kill." These words are not repeated until the last plague.<br>
 <a name="fn305" href="exo.htm#fnB305"><sup>74</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:24)  Or "at a lodging place" or "at an inn."<br>
 <a name="fn306" href="exo.htm#fnB306"><sup>75</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:24)  The next section (vv. 24-26) records a rather bizarre story. God had said that if Pharaoh would not comply he would kill his son--but now God was ready to kill Moses, the representative of Israel, God's own son. Apparently, we would reconstruct, on the journey Moses fell seriously ill; but his wife, learning the cause of the illness, saved his life by circumcising her son and casting the foreskin at Moses' feet (indicating that it was symbolically Moses' foreskin). The point is that this son of Abraham had not complied with the sign of the Abrahamic covenant. No one, according to Exod 12, would take part in the passover-exodus who had not complied. So how could the one who was going to lead God's people not comply? The bold anthropomorphisms and the clear significance at the border invite comparisons with Gen 32, the Angel wrestling with Jacob. In both cases there is a brush with death that could not be forgotten. See also, W. Dumbrell, "Exodus 4:24-25: A Textual Re-examination," <i>HTR</i> 65 (1972): 285-90; T. C. Butler, "An Anti-Moses Tradition," <i>JSOT</i> 12 (1979): 9-15; and L. Kaplan, "And the LORD Sought to Kill Him," <i>HAR </i>5 (1981): 65-74.<br>
 <a name="fn307" href="exo.htm#fnB307"><sup>76</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:25)  <i>Heb</i> "to his feet." The referent (Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity. The LXX has "and she fell at his feet" and then "the blood of the circumcision of my son stood." But it is clear that she caused the foreskin to touch Moses' feet, as if the one were a substitution for the other, taking the place of the other (see Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, p. 60).<br>
 <a name="fn308" href="exo.htm#fnB308"><sup>77</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:25)  Cassuto explains that she was saying, "I have delivered you from death, and your return to life makes you my bridegroom a second time, this time my blood bridegroom, a bridegroom acquired through blood" (<i>Exodus</i>, 60-61).<br>

The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">za*</FONT> (<i>`az</i>) here is not introducing the next item in a series of events. It points back to the past ("at that time," see Gen 4:26) or to a logical connection ("therefore, consequently").<br>
 <a name="fn311" href="exo.htm#fnB311"><sup>80</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:26)  The Hebrew simply has <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tOWMl^</FONT> (<i>lammulot</i>), "to the circumcision[s]." The phrase explains that the saying was in reference to the act of circumcision. Some scholars speculate that there was a ritual prior to marriage from which this event and its meaning derived. But it appears rather that if there was some ancient ritual, it would have had to come from this event. The difficulty is that the son is circumcised, not Moses, making the comparative mythological view untenable. Moses had apparently not circumcised Eliezer. And since Moses was taking his family with him, which was not wise, God had to make sure the sign of the covenant was kept. It seems likely that here Moses sent them all back to Jethro (18:2) because of the difficulties that lay ahead.<br>

 <a name="fn313" href="exo.htm#fnB313"><sup>82</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:27)  Driver notes that this verse is a continuation of vv. 17 and 18, since it is apparent that Aaron met Moses before Moses started back to Egypt (<i>Exodus, </i>p. 33). The first verb, then, might have the nuance of a past perfect: Yahweh had said.<br>
 <a name="fn314" href="exo.htm#fnB314"><sup>83</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:27)  <i>Heb</i> "and kissed him."<br>
 <a name="fn315" href="exo.htm#fnB315"><sup>84</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:28)  This verb, and the last one in the verse, are rendered with the past perfect nuance since they refer to what the LORD had done prior to Moses' telling Aaron.<br>
 <a name="fn316" href="exo.htm#fnB316"><sup>85</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:29)  These are the natural leaders of the tribes who represented all the people. Later, after the exodus, Moses will select the most capable of them and others to be rulers in a judicial sense (Exod 18:21). <br>

 <a name="fn318" href="exo.htm#fnB318"><sup>87</sup></a><b>tc</b> (4:31)  The LXX (Greek OT) has "and they rejoiced," probably reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wjm=c=Y]w~</FONT> (<i>wayyism<sup>e</sup>hu</i>) instead of what is in the MT, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wum=c=Y]w~</FONT> (<i>wayyism<sup>e</sup>'u</i>). This would have seemed a natural response of the people at the news, and it would have been an easier word order.<br>
 <b>tn</b> (4:31)  The form is the preterite with the <i>vav</i> consecutive, "and they heard." It clearly is a temporal clause subordinate to the following verbs that report how they bowed and worshiped. But it is also in sequence to the preceding: they believed, and then they bowed when they heard.<br>
 <a name="fn319" href="exo.htm#fnB319"><sup>88</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:31)  Or "intervened for." The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dq~P*</FONT> (<i>paqad</i>) was traditionally translated "visited," which is open to many interpretations. It means that God intervened in the life of the Israelites to bless them with the fulfillment of the promises. It says more than that he took notice of them, took pity on them, or remembered them. He had not yet fulfilled the promises, but he had begun to act by calling Moses and Aaron. The translation "attended to" attempts to capture that much. <br>
 <a name="fn320" href="exo.htm#fnB320"><sup>89</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:31)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WWj&amp;T^v=Y]w~</FONT> (<i>wayyistahawu</i>) is usually rendered "worshiped." More specifically, the verbal root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwj</FONT> (<i>hawa; </i>listed under <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hjv</FONT> [<i>saha</i>] in BDB) in the <i>hishtaphel </i>stem means "to cause oneself to be low to the ground." While there is nothing wrong with giving it a general translation of "worship," it may be better in a passage like this to take it in conjunction with the other verb ("bow") as a verbal hendiadys, using it as an adverb to that verb. The implication is certainly that they prayed, or praised, and performed some other aspect of worship; but the text may just be describing it from their posture of worship. With this response, all the fears of Moses are swept aside--they believed and they were thankful to God. <br>
 <a name="fn321" href="exo.htm#fnB321"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:1)  The enthusiasm of the worshipers in the preceding chapter turns sour in this one when Pharaoh refuses to cooperate. The point is clear from the chapter: when the people of God attempt to devote their full service and allegiance to God, they encounter opposition from the world. Rather than finding instant blessing and peace, they find conflict. This is the theme that will continue through the plague narratives. But what makes chap. 5 interesting is how the people reacted to this opposition. There are three sections to the chapter: first, there is the confrontation between Moses and Pharaoh (vv. 1-5); then there is the report of the stern opposition of the king (vv. 6-14); and finally, there is the sad account of the effect of this opposition on the people (vv.15-21).<br>
 <a name="fn322" href="exo.htm#fnB322"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:1)  <i>Heb</i> "Yahweh."<br>
 <a name="fn323" href="exo.htm#fnB323"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:1)  The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jL^v^</FONT> (<i>sallah</i>), the Piel imperative, has been traditionally translated "let [my people] go." The Qal would be "send"; so the Piel<i> </i>"send away, release, dismiss, discharge." Jacob makes the important point for exposition: "If a person was dismissed through the use of this verb, then he ceased to be within the power or sphere of influence of the individual who had dismissed him. He was completely free and subsequently acted entirely on his own responsibility" (<i>Exodus</i>, p. 115). <br>
 <a name="fn324" href="exo.htm#fnB324"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:1)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ggj</FONT> (<i>hagag</i>) means to hold a feast, or to go on a pilgrim feast. The Arabic cognate of the noun form is <i>haj</i>, best known for the pilgrim flight of Mohammed, the <i>hajira.</i> The form in the text, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WGj)y&#180;w+</FONT> (<i>w<sup>e</sup>yahoggu</i>), is subordinated to the imperative and thus shows the purpose of the imperative. <br>
 <a name="fn325" href="exo.htm#fnB325"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:2)  <i>Heb</i> "Yahweh." This is a rhetorical question, expressing doubt or indignation or simply a negative thought that Yahweh is nothing (see <i>erotesis</i> in Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 944ff.).<br>
 <a name="fn326" href="exo.htm#fnB326"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:2)  The relative pronoun introduces the consecutive clause that depends on the interrogative clause (see GKC &#167;107.<i>u</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn327" href="exo.htm#fnB327"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:2)  The imperfect tense here receives the classification of obligatory imperfect. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">umv</FONT> (<i>sama'</i>) followed by "in the voice of" is idiomatic; rather than render it "I should listen to his voice" it simply means "I should obey him."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (5:2)  The construction of these clauses is similar to (ironically) the words of Moses: "Who am I that I should go?" (3:11).<br>
 <a name="fn328" href="exo.htm#fnB328"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:2)  The Piel infinitive construct here has the epexegetical usage with <i>lamed</i>; it explains the verb "obey."<br>
 <a name="fn329" href="exo.htm#fnB329"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:2)  This absolute statement of Pharaoh is part of a motif that will develop throughout the conflict. For Pharaoh, the LORD (Yahweh) did not exist. So he said "I do not know the LORD [i.e., Yahweh]." The point of the plagues and the exodus will be "that he might know." Pharaoh will come to know this Yahweh, but not in any pleasant way.<br>
 <a name="fn330" href="exo.htm#fnB330"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:3)  The word "journey" is an adverbial accusative telling the distance that Moses wanted the people to go. It is qualified by "three days." It is not saying that they will be gone three days, but that they will go a distance that will take three days to cover (see Gen 31:22-23; Num 10:33; 33:8).<br>
 <a name="fn331" href="exo.htm#fnB331"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:3)  The purpose clause here is formed with a second cohortative joined with a <i>vav</i>: "let us go...and let us sacrifice." The purpose of the going was to sacrifice. And obviously, Pharaoh would only be letting them go, not letting them sacrifice.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (5:3)  Where did Moses get the idea that they should have a pilgrim feast and make sacrifices? God had only said they would serve Him in that mountain. In the OT the pilgrim feasts to the sanctuary three times a year incorporated the ideas of serving the LORD and keeping the commands. So the words here simply use the more general idea of appearing before their God. And, they would go to the desert because there was no homeland yet. Only there could they be free.<br>
 <a name="fn332" href="exo.htm#fnB332"><sup>12</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:3)  The last clause of this verse is rather unexpected here: "lest he meet [afflict] us with pestilence or sword." To fail to comply with the summons of one's God was to invite such calamities. The Law would later incorporate many such things as the curses for disobedience. Moses is indicating to Pharaoh that there is more reason to fear Yahweh than Pharaoh.<br>
 <a name="fn333" href="exo.htm#fnB333"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:4)  The clause is a rhetorical question. Pharaoh is not asking them why they do this, but rather is accusing them of doing it. He suspects their request is an attempt to get people time away from their labor: they were "removing the restraint" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ur~P*</FONT>, <i>para`</i>) of the people in an effort to give them rest. Ironically, under the Law the people would be expected to cease their labor when they went to appear before God. At any rate, it should be noted that it was not Israel who doubted that Yahweh had sent Moses--it was Pharaoh. <br>
 <a name="fn334" href="exo.htm#fnB334"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:5)  <i>Heb</i> "And Pharaoh said." This is not the kind of thing that Pharaoh is likely to have said to Moses, and so it probably is what he thought or reasoned within himself. Other passages (like Exod 2:14; 3:3) show that the verb "said" can do this. See Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, p. 67). <br>
 <a name="fn335" href="exo.htm#fnB335"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:6)  <i>Heb</i> "and Pharaoh commanded on that day."<br>
 <a name="fn336" href="exo.htm#fnB336"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:6)  The Greek has "scribes" for this word, perhaps thinking of those lesser officials as keeping records of the slaves and the bricks.<br>
 <a name="fn337" href="exo.htm#fnB337"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:6)  The phrase "who were" is supplied for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn338" href="exo.htm#fnB338"><sup>18</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:6)  In vv. 6-14 we have the second section of the chapter, the severe measures by the king to increase the labor by decreasing the material. The emphasis in this section must be on the harsh treatment of the people and Pharaoh's reason for it--he accuses them of idleness because they want to go and worship. The real reason, of course, is that he wants to discredit Moses (v. 9) and keep the people as slaves. <br>
 <a name="fn339" href="exo.htm#fnB339"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:7)  The construction is a verbal hendiadys: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tt@l* /Wps!at) aO</FONT> (<i>lo' to'sipun latet</i>) "you must not add to give." The imperfect tense acts adverbially, and the infinitive becomes the main verb of the clause: "you must no longer give."<br>
 <a name="fn340" href="exo.htm#fnB340"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:7)  The expression "for making bricks" is made of the infinitive construct followed by its cognate accusative:<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> &lt;yn]b@L=h^ /B)l=l!</FONT> (<i>lilbon hall<sup>e</sup>benim</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn341" href="exo.htm#fnB341"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:7)  The jussive <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wkl=y}</FONT> (<i>yel<sup>e</sup>ku</i>), and its following sequential verb, would have the force of decree and not permission or advice. He is telling them to go and find straw or stubble for the bricks.<br>
 <a name="fn342" href="exo.htm#fnB342"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:8)  The verb is the Qal imperfect of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yc!</FONT> (<i>sim</i>), "place, put." The form could be an imperfect of instruction: "You will place upon them the quota." Or, as here, it may be an obligatory imperfect: "You must place."<br>
 <a name="fn343" href="exo.htm#fnB343"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:8)  <i>Heb</i> "yesterday and three days ago" or "yesterday and before that" is idiomatic for "previously" or "in the past."<br>

They had been letting the work go, Pharaoh reasoned, and being idle is why they had time to think about going to worship.<br>
 <a name="fn345" href="exo.htm#fnB345"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:9)  <i>Heb</i> "let the work be heavy."<br>
 <a name="fn346" href="exo.htm#fnB346"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:9)  The text has <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Hb*-Wcu&amp;y~w+</FONT> (<i>w<sup>e</sup>ya'asu-bah</i>), "and let them work in it" or the like. The jussive forms part of the king's decree that the men not only be required to work harder but be doing it: "Let them be occupied in it."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (5:9)  For a discussion of this whole section, see K. A. Kitchen, "From the Brickfields of Egypt," <i>TynBul</i> 27 (1976): 137-47.<br>
 <a name="fn347" href="exo.htm#fnB347"><sup>27</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:9)  The words of Moses are here called "lying words" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rq#v*-yr@b=d]</FONT> [<i>dibre-saqer</i>]). Here is the main reason, then, for Pharaoh's new policy. He wanted to discredit Moses. So the words that Moses spoke Pharaoh calls false and lying words. The world was saying that God's words were vain and deceptive because they were calling people to a higher order. In a short time God would reveal that they were true words.<br>
 <a name="fn348" href="exo.htm#fnB348"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:10)  The construction uses the negative particle combined with a subject suffix before the participle: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/t@n) yN]n\ya@</FONT> (<i>`enenni noten</i>), "there is not I--giving." <br>
 <a name="fn349" href="exo.htm#fnB349"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:11)  The independent personal pronoun emphasizes that the people were to get their own straw, and heightens the contrast with the king. "<i>You</i>--go get."<br>
 <a name="fn350" href="exo.htm#fnB350"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:11)  The tense in this section could be translated as having the nuance of possibility: "wherever you may find it," or the nuance of potential imperfect: "wherever you are able to find any."<br>
 <a name="fn351" href="exo.htm#fnB351"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:12)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jp#Y&#180;w~</FONT> (<i>wayyapes</i>) is from the hollow root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">JWP</FONT> and means "scatter, spread abroad." <br>

 <a name="fn353" href="exo.htm#fnB353"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:13)  <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WLK^</FONT> (<i>kallu</i>) is the Piel imperative; the verb means "to finish, complete" in the sense of filling up the quota. <br>
 <a name="fn354" href="exo.htm#fnB354"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:14)  The quotation is introduced with the common word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rm,,al@</FONT> (<i>le'mor</i>), "saying," and no mention of who said the question.<br>
 <a name="fn355" href="exo.htm#fnB355"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:14)  Or "your task."<br>
 <a name="fn356" href="exo.htm#fnB356"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:14)  The idioms are difficult in this line of the Hebrew text, and some interpreters have spent a good deal of time trying to sort out how many days the Israelites had missed the quota. The line has "yesterday the third day, also yesterday, also today." The first part seems to mean "three days behind us" and so "a few days ago" and then "yesterday" and "today." <br>
 <a name="fn357" href="exo.htm#fnB357"><sup>37</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:15)  The last section of this event tells the effect of the oppression on Israel, first on the people (15-19) and then on Moses and Aaron (20-21). The immediate reaction of Israel was to cry to Pharaoh--something they would learn should be directed to God. When Pharaoh rebuffed them harshly, they turned bitterly against their leaders. <br>
 <a name="fn358" href="exo.htm#fnB358"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:15)  The imperfect tense should be classified here with the progressive imperfect nuance, because the harsh treatment was a present reality. <br>
 <a name="fn359" href="exo.htm#fnB359"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:16)  <i>Heb</i> "[they] are saying to us," the line can be rendered as a passive since there is no expressed subject for the participle.<br>

 <a name="fn361" href="exo.htm#fnB361"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:16)  The word rendered "fault" is the basic OT verb for "sin"--<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">taf*j*w+</FONT> (<i>w<sup>e</sup>hata't</i>). The problem is that it is pointed as a perfect tense, feminine singular. Some other form of the verb would be expected, or a noun. But the basic word-group means "to err, sin, miss the mark, way, goal." The word in this context seems to indicate that the people of Pharaoh--the slavemasters--have failed to provide the straw. Hence: "fault" or "they failed." But, as indicated, the line has difficult grammar, for it would literally translate: "and you [fem.] sin your people." Many commentators (so GKC &#167;74.<i>g</i>) wish to emend the text to read with the Greek and the Syriac, thus: "you sin against your own people" (meaning the Israelites are his loyal subjects). Cassuto thinks it had that thought but was toned down a bit before Pharaoh. Nevertheless, the meaning is still clear enough; they were protesting the unfair treatment.<br>
 <a name="fn362" href="exo.htm#fnB362"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:17)  <i>Heb</i> "And he said."<br>
 <a name="fn363" href="exo.htm#fnB363"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:18)  The text has two imperatives: "go, work." They may be used together to convey one complex idea (so a use of hendiadys): "go back to work."<br>
 <a name="fn364" href="exo.htm#fnB364"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:18)  The imperfect <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WNT@T!</FONT> (<i>tittennu</i>) is here taken as an obligatory imperfect: "you must give" or "you must produce."<br>
 <a name="fn365" href="exo.htm#fnB365"><sup>45</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:18)  Jacob is amazed at the wealth of this tyrant's vocabulary in describing the work of others. Here, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/k#t)</FONT> (<i>token</i>) is another word for "quota" of bricks, the fifth word used to describe their duty (<i>Exodus</i>, p. 137). <br>
 <a name="fn366" href="exo.htm#fnB366"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:19)  The verb means "saw"; in fact, the verse begins with "and they saw." But here it means that they perceived or understood how difficult things would be under this ruling.<br>
 <a name="fn367" href="exo.htm#fnB367"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:19)  The text has the sign of the accusative with a suffix and then a prepositional phrase: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ur*B= &lt;t*a)</FONT> (<i>`otam b<sup>e</sup>ra'</i>), meaning something like "[they saw] them in trouble" or "themselves in trouble." Gesenius shows a few examples where the accusative of the reflexive pronoun is represented by the sign of the accusative with a suffix, and these with marked emphasis (GKC &#167;135.<i>k</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn368" href="exo.htm#fnB368"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:19)  The clause "when they were told" translates <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rm)al@</FONT> (<i>le'mor</i>), which usually simply means "saying." The thing that was said was clearly the decree that was given to them.<br>
 <a name="fn369" href="exo.htm#fnB369"><sup>49</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:20)  Moses and Aaron would not have gone and made an appeal to Pharaoh as these Hebrew foremen did; but they were concerned to see what might happen, and so they stationed themselves outside the palace to meet them when they came out. <br>
 <a name="fn370" href="exo.htm#fnB370"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:21)  The foremen vent their anger now on Moses and Aaron. The two jussives express their desire that the evil these two have caused be dealt with. "May Yahweh look on you and may he judge" could simply mean that God should decide if Moses and Aaron are at fault, but given the rest of the comments it is clear the foremen want more. The second jussive could be subordinated to the first--"that he may judge [you]."<br>
 <a name="fn371" href="exo.htm#fnB371"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:21)  <i>Heb</i> "you have made our aroma stink."<br>

Because of the bad reputation they now have, Pharaoh could rather gladly put them to death. The second infinitive could also be expressing result: "put a sword in their hand <i>so that</i> they can kill us."<br>
 <a name="fn374" href="exo.htm#fnB374"><sup>54</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:22)  In view of the apparent failure of the mission, Moses seeks Yahweh for assurance. The answer from Yahweh not only assures him that all is well, but that there will be a great deliverance. The passage can be divided into three parts: the complaint of Moses (5:22-23), the promise of Yahweh (6:1-9), and the instructions for Moses (6:10-13). Moses complains because God has not delivered his people as he had said he would, and God answers that he will because he is the sovereign covenant God who keeps his word. Therefore, Moses must keep his commission to speak God's word. See further, E. A. Martens, "Tackling Old Testament Theology," <i>JETS</i> 20 (1977): 123-32. The message is very similar to that found in the NT, "Where is the promise of his coming?" (2 Pet 3:4; in fact, the points Peter makes harmonize with the points here). The complaint of Moses (5:22-23) can be worded with Peter's "Where is the promise of his coming?" theme; the assurance from Yahweh (6:1-9) can be worded with Peter's "The Lord is not slack in keeping his promises" (2 Pet. 3:9); and the third part, the instructions for Moses (6:10-13) can be worded with Peter's "prepare for the day of God and speed its coming" (2 Pet 3:12). The people who speak for God must do so in the sure confidence of the coming deliverance--Moses with the deliverance from the bondage of Egypt, and Christians with the deliverance from this sinful world.<br>
 <a name="fn375" href="exo.htm#fnB375"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:22)  <i>Heb</i> "and Moses returned."<br>
 <a name="fn376" href="exo.htm#fnB376"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:22)  The designation in Moses' address is "Lord" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn&#180;d)a&amp;</FONT> [<i>`adonay</i>])--the term for "lord" or "master" but pointed as it would be when it represents the tetragrammaton.<br>
 <a name="fn377" href="exo.htm#fnB377"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:22)  The verb is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ht*u)r@h&amp;</FONT> (<i>hare'ota</i>), the Hiphil perfect of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">uur</FONT> (<i>ra'a'</i>). The word itself means "to do evil," and in this stem "to cause evil"--but evil in the sense of pain, calamity, trouble, or affliction, and not always in the sense of sin. Certainly not here. That God had allowed Pharaoh to oppose them had brought greater pain to the Israelites.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (5:22)  Moses' question is rhetorical; the point is more of a complaint or accusation to God, although there is in it the desire to know why. Jacob comments that such frank words were a sign of the man's closeness to God. God never has objected to such bold complaints by the devout. Jacob then notes how God was angered by his defenders in the Book of Job rather than by Job's heated accusations (<i>Exodus</i>, 139).<br>
 <a name="fn378" href="exo.htm#fnB378"><sup>58</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:22)  The demonstrative pronoun is enclitic here, serving for emphasis in the question (see Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;118). This second question continues Moses' bold approach to God, more chiding than praying. He is implying that if this was the result of the call, then God had no purpose calling him (compare Jeremiah's similar complaint in Jer 20).<br>
 <a name="fn379" href="exo.htm#fnB379"><sup>59</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:23)  Now the verb ( <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ur^h@</FONT> [<i>hera'</i>]) has a different subject--Pharaoh. The ultimate cause of the trouble was God, but the immediate cause was Pharaoh and the way he increased the work. Moses knows all about the sovereignty of God; and as he speaks in God's name, he sees the effect it has on pagans like Pharaoh. So the rhetorical questions are designed to prod God to act differently. <br>

The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lxn</FONT> (<i>nasal</i>) means "to deliver, rescue" in the sense of plucking out, even plundering. The infinitive absolute strengthens both the idea of the verb and the negative. God had not delivered this people at all. <br>
 <a name="fn381" href="exo.htm#fnB381"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (6:1)  The expression "I will do to Pharaoh" always refers to the plagues. God would first show his sovereignty over Pharaoh before defeating him. <br>

In Exod 3:19 it referred to Yahweh's strong hand, and while this is not as clear grammatically here, it probably is what is intended. All Egypt ultimately desired that Israel be released (12:33), and when they were released Pharaoh pursued them to the sea, and so in a sense drove them out--whether that was his intent or not. But ultimately it was God's power that was the real force behind it all. Cassuto considers that it is unlikely that the phrase would be used in the same verse twice with the same meaning. So the first "mighty hand" is God's, and the second "mighty hand" is Pharaoh's (<i>Exodus</i>, 74). It is true that if Pharaoh acted forcefully in any way that contributed to Israel leaving Egypt it was because God was acting forcefully in his life.<br>

In that place God called Moses to this task and explained the significance of the name "Yahweh" by the enigmatic expression "I AM that I AM." "I AM," (that is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hy\h=a#</FONT> [`<i>ehyeh</i>]), is not a name; "Yahweh" is. But the explanation of the name with this sentence indicates that Yahweh is the one who is always there, and that guarantees the future, for everything he does is consistent with his nature. He is eternal, never changing; he remains. But now, in Exodus 6, the full meaning of the name "Yahweh" will be unfolded.<br>
 <a name="fn386" href="exo.htm#fnB386"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:3)  The preposition <i>bet</i> in this construction should be classified as a <i>bet essentiae</i>, a <i>bet</i> of essence (see also GKC &#167;119.<i>i</i>). <br>

If the text had wanted to say, "I did not make myself known," then a Hiphil form would have been more likely. It is saying, "but by my name Yahweh I was not known to them."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (6:3)  There are a number of important issues that need clarification in the interpretation of this section. The main points of this section of notes are drawn from the commentaries by Benno Jacob and Umberto Cassuto. First, it is important to note that "I am Yahweh" is not a new revelation of a previously unknown name. That is not the way it would be written if it were. This is the identification of the covenant God as the one calling Moses--that would be proof for the people that their God had called him. Second, the title "El Shadday" is not a name, but a title. It is true that in the patriarchal accounts "El Shadday" is used six times; in Job it is used thirty times. Many conclude that it does reflect the idea of might or power. In some of those passages that reveal God as "El Shadday," the name "Yahweh" was also used. But Wellhausen and other proponents of the earlier source critical analysis used Exod 6:3 to show that P was aware that the name "Yahweh" was not known by them, even though J wrote using the name as part of his theology. But there is a better explanation than that. Third, a careful reading of the texts of Genesis shows that Yahweh had appeared to the patriarchs (Gen 12:1, 17:1, 18:1, 26:2, 26:24, 26:12, 35:1, 48:3), and that he spoke to each one of them (Gen 12:7, 15:1, 26:2, 28:13, 31:3). The name "Yahweh" occurs 162 times in Genesis, 34 of those times on the lips of speakers in Genesis (W. C. Kaiser, Jr, "Exodus," in <i>EBC</i>, 340-41). They also made proclamation of Yahweh by name (4:26, 12:8); they named places with the name (22:14). These passages cannot be ignored, or passed off as later interpretation. Fourth, "Yahweh" revealed as the God of power, the sovereign God, who was true to and could be believed. He would do as he said (Num 23:19; 14:35; Exod 12:25; 22:24; 24:14; 36:36; 37:14). Fifth, there is a difference between promise and fulfillment in the way revelation is apprehended. The patriarchs were individuals who received the promises; but without the fulfillment they were empty words. The fulfillment could only come after they became a nation. Now, in Egypt, they are ready to become that promised nation. The two periods were not distinguished by not having and by having the name, but by two ways God revealed the significance of his name. "I am Yahweh" to the patriarchs indicated that he was the absolute, almighty, eternal God. The patriarchs were individuals sojourning in the land. God appeared to them in the significance of El Shadday. That was not his name; he appeared as El Shadday. So Gen 17:1 says that "Yahweh appeared...and said, `I am El Shadday'." See also Gen 35:11, 48:2, 28:3. Sixth, the verb "to know" is never used to introduce a name which had never been known or experienced. The Niphal and Hiphil of the verb are used only to describe the recognition of the overtones or significance of the name (see Jer 16:21, Isa 52:6; Ps 83:17ff; 1 Kgs 8:41ff. [people will know his name when prayers are answered]). For someone to say that he knew Yahweh meant that Yahweh had been experienced or recognized (see Exod 33:6; 1 Kgs 18:36; Jer 28:9; and Ps 76:2). Seventh, "Yahweh" is not one of God's names--it is his only name. Other titles, like "El Shadday," are not names but means of revealing Yahweh. All the revelations to the patriarchs could not compare to this one, because God wa now dealing with the nation. He would make his name known to them through his deeds (see Ezek 20:5). So now they will "know" the "name." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">udy</FONT> (<i>yada'</i>) means more than "aware of, be knowledgeable about"; it means "to experience" the reality of the revelation by that name. This harmonizes with the usage of<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> &lt;v@</FONT> (<i>sem</i>), "name," which means all the attributes and actions of God. It is not simply a reference to a title, but to the way that God revealed himself--God gave meaning to his name through his acts. God is not saying that he had not revealed a name to the patriarchs (that would have used the Hiphil of the verb). Rather, he is saying that the patriarchs did not experience what the name Yahweh actually meant, and they could not without seeing it fulfilled. When Moses came to the elders, he identified his call as from Yahweh, the God of the fathers--and they accepted him. They knew the name. But, when they were delivered from bondage, then they fully knew by experience what that name meant, for his promises were fulfilled. Cassuto paraphrases it this way: "I revealed Myself to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in My aspect that finds expression in the name Shaddai...I was not known to them, that is, it was not given to them to recognize Me as One that fulfils his promises" (p. 79). This generation was about to "know" the name that their ancestors knew and used, but never experienced with the fulfillment of the promises. This section of Exodus confirms this interpretation, because in it God promised to bring them out of Egypt and give them the promised land--then they would know that he is Yahweh (6:7). This meaning should have been evident from its repetition to the Egyptians throughout the plagues--that they might know Yahweh (e.g., 7:5). See further: R. D. Wilson, "Yahweh [Jehovah] and Exodus 6:3," in <i>Classical Evangelical Essays in OT Interpretation</i>, ed. by W. Kaiser (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1972), 29-40; L. A. Herrboth, "Exodus 6:3b: Was God Known to the Patriarchs as Jehovah?" <i>CTM</i> 4 (1931): 345-49; F. C. Smith, "Observation on the Use of the Names and Titles of God in Genesis," <i>EvQ</i> 40 (1968): 103-109.<br>
 <a name="fn391" href="exo.htm#fnB391"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:4)  The statement refers to the making of the covenant with Abraham (Gen 15 and following) and confirming it with the other patriarchs. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yt!m)q!h&amp;</FONT> (<i>haqimoti</i>) mans "set up, establish, give effect to, conclude" a covenant agreement. The covenant promised the patriarchs a great nation, a land--Canaan, and divine blessing. They lived with those promises, but now their descendants were in bondage in Egypt. God's reference to the covenant here is meant to show the new revelation through redemption will start to fulfill the promises and show what the reality of the name Yahweh is to them. <br>
 <a name="fn392" href="exo.htm#fnB392"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:4)  <i>Heb</i> "the land of their sojournings." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yr!g%m=</FONT> (<i>m<sup>e</sup>gurim</i>) is a reminder that the patriarchs did not receive the promises. It is also an indication that those living in the age of promise did not experience the full meaning of the name of the covenant God. The "land of their sojournings" is the land of Canaan where the family lived without owning property or having any rights--as aliens (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WrG</FONT> [<i>garu</i>]). <br>
 <a name="fn393" href="exo.htm#fnB393"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:5)  The addition of the independent pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn]a&amp;</FONT> (<i>`ani</i>), "I," emphasizes the fact that it was Yahweh who heard the cry.<br>

 <a name="fn395" href="exo.htm#fnB395"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:5)  The form is the Hiphil participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yd!b!u&amp;m^</FONT> (<i>ma'abidim</i>), "causing to serve." The participle occurs in a relative clause that modifies "the Israelites." The clause ends with the accusative "them," which must be combined with the relative pronoun for a good English translation: "who the Egyptians are enslaving them," resulting in the translation "whom the Egyptians are enslaving." <br>
 <a name="fn396" href="exo.htm#fnB396"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:5)  As in Exod 2:24, this verb has the significance of God's beginning to act to fulfill the covenant promises. <br>

 <a name="fn398" href="exo.htm#fnB398"><sup>18</sup></a><b>sn</b> (6:7)  These covenant promises are being reiterated here because they are about to be fulfilled. They are addressed to the nation, not individuals, as the plural suffixes show. Yahweh was their God already, because they had been praying to him. But when they enter into covenant with God at Sinai, then he will be the God of Israel in a new way. <br>
 <a name="fn399" href="exo.htm#fnB399"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:8)  The text simply says, "which I raised my hand to give it...." The relative clause specifies which land is their goal. And the bold anthropomorphism reminds the reader that God swore that he would give the land to them. The comparison with taking an oath would have made the promise of God sure in the mind of the Israelite.<br>
 <a name="fn400" href="exo.htm#fnB400"><sup>20</sup></a><b>sn</b> (6:8)  Here is the twofold aspect again clearly depicted: God swore the promise to the patriarchs, but he is about to give what he promised to this generation. This generation will know more about him as a result. <br>
 <a name="fn401" href="exo.htm#fnB401"><sup>21</sup></a><b>sn</b> (6:9)  The final part of this section focuses on instructions for Moses. The commission from God is the same--he is to speak to Pharaoh and he is to lead Israel out. It should have been clear to him that God would do this, for he had just been reminded how God was going to lead out, deliver, redeem, take to the people as his people. It was God's work of love from beginning to end. And so Moses simply had his task to perform. <br>

This means that they were discouraged, dispirited, and weary--although some have also suggested it might mean impatient. The Israelites were now just not in the frame of mind to listen to Moses.<br>
 <a name="fn405" href="exo.htm#fnB405"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:11)  The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jL^v^yw] </FONT>(<i>wisallah</i>) is the Piel imperfect or jussive with a sequential <i>vav;</i> following the imperatives this will show purpose.

 <a name="fn406" href="exo.htm#fnB406"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:12)  <i>Heb</i> "spoke before."<br>
 <a name="fn407" href="exo.htm#fnB407"><sup>27</sup></a><b>sn</b> (6:12)  This analogy is an example of the <i>qal wahomer</i> rule in hermeneutics. It is an argument by inference from the light to the heavy, from the simple to the more difficult. If the Israelites, who are Yahwists, would not listen to him, it is highly unlikely Pharaoh would. <br>
 <a name="fn408" href="exo.htm#fnB408"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:12)  The final clause begins with a disjunctive <i>vav</i>, a <i>vav</i> on a non-verb form--here a pronoun. It introduces a circumstantial causal clause.<br>
 <a name="fn409" href="exo.htm#fnB409"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:12)  <i>Heb</i> "and [since] I am of uncircumcised lips." The "lips" represent his speech (metonymy of cause). The term "uncircumcised" makes a comparison between his speech and that which Israel perceived as unacceptable, unprepared, foreign, and of no use to God. Driver explains that the term means the lips are closed in, and so open and speak with difficulty. The heart is used this way when it is impervious to good impressions (Lev 26:41; Jer 9:26); and the ear when it hears imperfectly (Jer 6:10). Moses has here returned to his earlier claim--he does not speak well enough to be doing this.<br>
 <a name="fn410" href="exo.htm#fnB410"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:13)  <i>Heb</i> "And Yahweh spoke."<br>
 <a name="fn411" href="exo.htm#fnB411"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:13)  The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;W@X^y+w~</FONT> (<i>waysawwem</i>) is the Piel preterite with the pronominal suffix on it. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwX</FONT> (<i>siwwa</i>) means "to command" but can also have a much wider range of meanings. Here the idea of giving Moses and Aaron a charge, like a commission, to Israel and to Pharaoh, indicates that come what may they have their duty to perform.<br>
 <a name="fn412" href="exo.htm#fnB412"><sup>32</sup></a><b>sn</b> (6:14)  The point of this list of names seems to be to show that Moses and Aaron are in the line of Levi that came to the priesthood.

 <a name="fn413" href="exo.htm#fnB413"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:14)  The expression is literally "the house of their fathers." This is an expression which means that the household or family descended from a single ancestor. It usually indicates a sub-division of a tribe, that is, a clan, or the subdivision of a clan, that is, a family. Here it refers to a clan (Driver, <i>Exodus,</i> p. 46).<br>

From here on the confrontation will intensify, until Pharaoh is destroyed. The emphasis here, though, is on Yahweh's instructions for Moses to speak to Pharaoh. The first section (6:28-7:7) ends (v. 6) with the notice that Moses and Aaron did just as (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rv#a&amp;K^</FONT> [<i>ka'aser</i>]) Yahweh had commanded them; the second section (7:8-13) ends with the note that Yahweh did just as (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rv#a&amp;K^</FONT> [<i>ka'aser</i>]) he had spoken. In short, the word of Yahweh is obeyed, and when it is obeyed it is fulfilled. <br>

 <a name="fn426" href="exo.htm#fnB426"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:1)  The word<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> &lt;yh!la$</FONT> (`<i>elohim</i>) is used a few times in the Bible for humans (e.g., Pss 45:6; 82:2), and always clearly in the sense of a subordinate to GOD--they are his representatives on earth. The explanation here goes back to 4:16. If Moses is like God in that Aaron is his prophet, then Moses is certainly like God to Pharaoh. Only Moses, then, is able to speak to Pharaoh with such authority, giving him commands. <br>
 <a name="fn427" href="exo.htm#fnB427"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:1)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;a#yb!n+</FONT> (<i>n<sup>e</sup>bi'eka</i>), "your prophet," is to be connected to 4:16 as well. Moses was to be like God to Aaron, and Aaron to speak for him. This indicates that the idea of a "prophet" was one who spoke for God.<br>
 <a name="fn428" href="exo.htm#fnB428"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:2)  The imperfect tense here should have the nuance of instruction or injunction: "you are to speak." The subject is made emphatic by the presence of the personal pronoun "<i>you</i>."<br>
 <a name="fn429" href="exo.htm#fnB429"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:2)  The clause ("all that I command you") is a noun clause serving as the direct object of the verb. The verb in the clause, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;W\X^a&amp;</FONT> (<i>`asawweka</i>), is the Piel imperfect. It could be classified as a future, except that Yahweh has already told him what to say. A nuance of progressive imperfect fits better: "all I am commanding you."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (7:2)  The distinct emphasis is important. Aaron will speak to the people and Pharaoh what Moses tells him, and Moses will speak to Aaron what God commands him. The use of "command" keeps everything in perspective for Moses' position. <br>

Following the imperfects of injunction or instruction, this verb continues the sequence. It could be taken as equal to an imperfect expressing future ("and he will release") or subordinate to express purpose ("to release" = "in order that he may release"). <br>
 <a name="fn431" href="exo.htm#fnB431"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:3)  The clause begins with the emphatic use of the pronoun and a disjunctive <i>vav</i> expressing the contrast "But as for me, I will harden." They will speak, but God will harden.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (7:3)  The imperfect tense of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hvq</FONT> (<i>qasa</i>) is found only here in these "hardening passages." The verb (here the Hiphil for "I will harden") summarizes Pharaoh's resistance to what God would be doing through Moses--he would stubbornly resist and refuse to submit; he would be resolved in his opposition. See R. R. Wilson, "The Hardening of Pharaoh's Heart," <i>CBQ</i> 41 (1979): 18-36.<br>
 <a name="fn432" href="exo.htm#fnB432"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:3)  The form beginning the second half of the verse is the perfect tense with the <i>vav </i>consecutive, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yt!yB@r+h!</FONT> (<i>hirbeti</i>). It could be translated as a simple future in sequence to the imperfect preceding it, but the logical connection is not obvious. Since it carries the force of an imperfect due to the sequence, it may be subordinated as a temporal clause to the next clause that begins in v. 4. That maintains the flow of the argument.<br>
 <a name="fn433" href="exo.htm#fnB433"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:4)  <i>Heb</i> "and Pharaoh will not listen."<br>
 <a name="fn434" href="exo.htm#fnB434"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:4)  The expression is a strong anthropomorphism to depict God's severest judgment on Egypt. The point is that neither the speeches of Moses and Aaron, or the signs that God would do, will be effective. Consequently, God would deliver the blow that would destroy. <br>
 <a name="fn435" href="exo.htm#fnB435"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:4)  "Hosts" is sometimes translated "armies" or "divisions." <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Toab*X=</FONT> (<i>s<sup>e</sup>ba'ot</i>) properly describes armies; the term may mean divisions or companies, but it is portraying the people of God in battle array. In contemporary English "regiments" is more easily understood as a force arrayed for battle, since "companies" or "divisions" can have commercial associations.<br>
 <a name="fn436" href="exo.htm#fnB436"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:5)  The emphasis on sequence is clear because the form is the perfect tense with the <i>vav</i> consecutive.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (7:5)  The use of the verb "to know" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">udy</FONT> [<i>yada'</i>]) underscores what was said with regard to 6:3. By the time the actual exodus took place, the Egyptians would have "known" the name Yahweh, probably hearing it more than they wished. But they will know--experience the truth of it--when Yahweh defeats them.<br>

This noun refers to a large reptile, used in some texts for large river or sea creatures (Gen 1:21; Ps 74:13) or land creatures (Deut 32:33). Driver thinks here it must be a large land reptile, or even a small crocodile. This wonder paralleled Moses' miracle in 4:3 when he cast his rod down. But this is Aaron's rod, and a different miracle. The noun could still be rendered "snake" here since the term could be broad enough to include it.<br>

They may have done this by clever tricks, manipulation of the animals, or demon power. Many have suggested that Aaron and the magicians were familiar with an old trick in which they could temporarily paralyze the serpent and then revive it. But here Aaron's snake will swallow their snakes. <br>
 <a name="fn449" href="exo.htm#fnB449"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:12)  The verb is plural, but the subject is singular, "a man--his staff." This noun can be given a distributive sense: "each man threw down his staff."<br>
 <a name="fn450" href="exo.htm#fnB450"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:13)  The text literally says, "and he hardened the heart of Pharaoh." But who is the subject? It is possible that it is Yahweh--but that is not stated. It is better in a case like this to make it passive since the subject is not expressed. Jacob has it: "the heart of Pharaoh remained hard." For more on this subject, Jacob has a lengthy excursion in his commentary from p. 241 to p. 249. Driver helps by noting that when this word (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qzj</FONT> [<i>hazaq</i>]) is used it indicates a heart or will or attitude that is unyielding, firm; but when <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dbK</FONT> (<i>kabed</i>) is used, it stresses the will as being slow to move, unimpressionable, slow to be affected (Driver, p. 53). <br>
 <a name="fn451" href="exo.htm#fnB451"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:14)  With the first plague, or blow on Pharaoh, a new section of the book unfolds. Up to now the dominate theme has been on preparing the deliverer for the exodus. Now, it will focus on preparing Pharaoh for it. The theological emphasis for exposition of the entire series of plagues may be: The sovereign Lord is fully able to deliver his people from the oppression of the world so that they might worship and serve him alone. The distinct idea of each plague then will have to contribute to this main idea. It is clear from the outset that God could have delivered his people simply and suddenly. But he chose to draw it out with the series of plagues. There are several reasons here: First, the plagues are designed to judge Egypt. It is justice for slavery. Second, the plagues are designed to inform Israel and Egypt of the nature of Yahweh. Everyone must know that it is Yahweh doing all these things. The Egyptians must know this before they are destroyed. And third, the plagues are designed to deliver Israel. The first plague is the plague of blood: God has absolute power over the sources of life. Here Yahweh strikes the heart of Egyptian life with death and corruption. The lesson is that God can turn the source of life into the prospect of death. Moreover, the Nile was venerated; so by turning it into death Moses was showing the superiority of Yahweh. <br>
 <a name="fn452" href="exo.htm#fnB452"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:14)  The word here is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">db@K*</FONT> (<i>kabed</i>).<br>

The whole clause is an explanation (like a metonymy of effect) of the first clause that states that Pharaoh's heart is hardened. <br>
 <a name="fn454" href="exo.htm#fnB454"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:15)  The clause begins with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hN@h!</FONT> (<i>hinneh</i>); here it provides the circumstances for the instruction for Moses--he is going out to the water so go meet him. A temporal clause translation captures the connection between the clauses.<br>
 <a name="fn455" href="exo.htm#fnB455"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:15)  The instruction to Moses continues with this perfect tense with <i>vav</i> consecutive following the imperative. The verb means "to take a stand, station oneself." It seems that Pharaoh's going out to the water was a regular feature of his day, and that Moses could be there waiting to meet him.<br>
 <a name="fn456" href="exo.htm#fnB456"><sup>31</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:15)  The Nile, the source of fertility for the country, was deified by the Egyptians. There were religious festivals held to the god of the Nile, especially when the Nile was inundated. The Talmud suggests that Pharaoh in this passage went out to the Nile to make observations as a magician about its level. Others (including <i>Tg. Yer. I</i>) suggest he went out simply to bathe, or to check the water level (Ibn Ezra)--but that would not change the view of the Nile that was prevalent in the land. <br>
 <a name="fn457" href="exo.htm#fnB457"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:15)  The Hebrew form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jQ^T!</FONT> (<i>tiqqah</i>), the Qal imperfect of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jql</FONT> (<i>laqah</i>), functions here as the imperfect of instruction, or injunction perhaps, given the word order the the clause.<br>
 <a name="fn458" href="exo.htm#fnB458"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:15)  The final clause begins with the noun and a <i>vav</i> disjunctive. This singles this instruction out for special attention--"now the rod...you are to take." <br>
 <a name="fn459" href="exo.htm#fnB459"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:16)  The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rm)al@</FONT> (<i>le'mor</i>) is the Qal infinitive construct with the <i>lamed</i> preposition. It is used so often epexegetically that it has achieved idiomatic status--"saying" (if translated at all). But here it would make better sense to take it as a purpose infinitive. God sent him to say these words.<br>
 <a name="fn460" href="exo.htm#fnB460"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:16)  The imperfect tense with the <i>vav</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn]d%b=u^y~w+</FONT> [<i>w<sup>e</sup>ya'abduni</i>]) following the imperative is in volitive sequence, showing the purpose--"that they may serve me." The word "serve" ( <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dbu</FONT> [<i>`abad</i>]) is a general term to include religious observance and obedience. <br>
 <a name="fn461" href="exo.htm#fnB461"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:16)  The final <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hK)-du^</FONT> (<i>`ad-koh</i>), "until now," narrows the use of the perfect tense to the preset perfect: "you have not listened." That verb, however, means more than "listen to." It has the idea of responding to, hearkening, and in some places obeying; here complying catches the point of what Moses is saying.<br>
 <a name="fn462" href="exo.htm#fnB462"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:17)  The construction using <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hN@h!</FONT> (<i>hinneh</i>) before the participle (here the Hiphil participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hK#m^</FONT> [<i>makkeh</i>]) introduces a <i>futur instans</i> use of the participle, expressing imminent future, that he is about to do something.<br>
 <a name="fn463" href="exo.htm#fnB463"><sup>38</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:17)  Kaiser summarizes the view that has been adopted by many scholars, including a good number of conservatives, that the plagues overlap with natural phenomena in Egypt. Accordingly, the "blood" would not be literal blood, but a reddish contamination in the water. If there was an unusually high inundation of the Nile, the water flows sluggishly through swamps and is joined with the water from the mountains that washes out the reddish soil. If the flood is high, the water will have a deeper red color. In addition to this discoloration, there is said to be a type of algae which produce a stench and a deadly fluctuation of the oxygen level of the river that is fatal to fish (W. C. Kaiser, "Exodus," <i>EBC</i>, p. 350; he cites Greta Hort, "The Plagues of Egypt," <i>ZAW</i> 69 [1957]: 84-103; <i>ZAW</i> 70 [1958]: 48-59). While most scholars would agree that the water did not actually become blood (any more than the moon will be turned to literal blood [Joel 2:31]), many are not comfortable with this kind of explanation. If it was a fairly common feature of the Nile, it would not have been any kind of sign to Pharaoh--and it should still be observable. The features that would have to be safeguarded are: it was understood to be done by the rod of God, it was unexpected and not a mere coincidence, and the magnitude of the contamination, color, stench, and death, was unparalleled. God does use natural features in miracles, but to be miraculous signs they cannot simply coincide with natural phenomena.<br>
 <a name="fn464" href="exo.htm#fnB464"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:18)  The definite article here has the generic use, indicating the class--"fish" (Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;92).<br>
 <a name="fn465" href="exo.htm#fnB465"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:18)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hal</FONT> (<i>la'a</i>), here in the Niphal perfect with a <i>vav</i> consecutive, means "be weary, impatient." The Niphal meaning is "make oneself weary" in doing something, or "weary (strenuously exert) oneself." It seems always to indicate exhausted patience (see BDB, p. 521). The term seems to imply that the Egyptians were not able to drink the red, contaminated water, and so would expend all their energy looking for water to drink--in frustration of course. <br>
 <a name="fn466" href="exo.htm#fnB466"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:19)  Or "irrigation rivers" of the Nile.<br>
 <a name="fn467" href="exo.htm#fnB467"><sup>42</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:19)  The Hebrew term means "gathering," i.e., wherever they gathered or collected waters, notably cisterns and reservoirs.

 <a name="fn468" href="exo.htm#fnB468"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:19)  The imperfect tense with the sequential <i>vav</i> indicates the purpose of result after the imperative: "in order that they be[come] blood." <br>

 <a name="fn470" href="exo.htm#fnB470"><sup>45</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:20)  Both Moses and Aaron had tasks to perform. Moses, being the "god" to Pharaoh, dealt directly with him and the Nile. He would strike the Nile. But Aaron, "his prophet," would stretch out the rod over the rest of the waters of Egypt. There is no reason to see two different accounts being woven together by a redactor. <br>

 <a name="fn473" href="exo.htm#fnB473"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:20)  The test could be rendered "in the presence of," or simply "before," but the literal idea of "before the eyes of" may stress that he did this in their plain sight.<br>
 <a name="fn474" href="exo.htm#fnB474"><sup>49</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:20)  Cassuto notes that the striking of the water was not a magical act. It signified two things: (1) the beginning of the sign, which was in accordance with God's will, which Moses had previously announced, and (2) to symbolize actual "striking," wherewith the Lord strikes Egypt and its gods (see v. 25) (<i>Exodus</i>, p. 98).<br>
 <a name="fn475" href="exo.htm#fnB475"><sup>50</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:20)  There have been various attempts to explain the details of this plague or blow. One possible suggestion is that the plague turned the Nile into "blood," but that it did not remain, but gradually and fairly quickly turned back to its normal color and substance. However, the effects of the "blood" polluted the water so that dead fish and other contamination left it undrinkable. This would explain how the magicians could also do it--they would not have tried if all water was already turned to blood. It also explains why Pharaoh did not ask for the water to be turned back. This view was put forward by B. Schor in 1856; it is summarized by B. Jacob (who prefers the view of Rashi that the blow only affected water in use), p. 258.<br>
 <a name="fn476" href="exo.htm#fnB476"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:21)  The clauses in this verse need to be interpreted in their relationships by means of the conjunction. The first clause begins with a <i>vav</i> disjunctive, here providing a circumstantial clause to the statement that the water smelled. The <i>vav</i> consecutive on the next verb shows that the smell was the result of the dead fish in the contaminated water. The result is then expressed with the <i>vav</i> beginning the next clause that states that they could not drink it.<br>
 <a name="fn477" href="exo.htm#fnB477"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:21)  The preterite could be given a simple definite past translation, but an ingressive past would be more likely, as the smell would get worse and worse with the dead fish.<br>

 <a name="fn482" href="exo.htm#fnB482"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:23)  The text has <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">taz)l*-&lt;G^ oBl! Tv*-aOw+</FONT> (<i>w<sup>e</sup>lo'-sat libbo gam-lazo't</i>), which literally says, "and he did not set his heart also to this." To "put something on the heart" would mean "to consider it." This Hebrew idiom means that he did not pay attention to it, or take it to heart (cf. 2 Sam 13:20; Jer 31:20; Ps 48:14, 62:11; Prov 22:17, 24:32). Since Pharaoh had not been affected by this, he did not consider it further. <br>
 <a name="fn483" href="exo.htm#fnB483"><sup>58</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:24)  The text stresses that the water of the Nile, and the Nile water that had been diverted or collected for use, was polluted and undrinkable. Water underground also was from the Nile, but it had not been contaminated, certainly not with dead fish, and so would be drinkable. <br>
 <a name="fn484" href="exo.htm#fnB484"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:25)  The attempt to connect this plague with the natural phenomena of Egypt would say that because of the polluted water due to the high Nile, the frogs abandoned all their normal watery homes (seven days after the first plague) and sought cover from the sun in the homes wherever there was moisture. Since they had already been exposed to the poisonous water they died very suddenly. The miracle was in the announcement and the timing, i.e., that Moses would predict this blow, and in the magnitude of it all which was not natural (Hort, "Plagues," p. 95-98). It is also important to note that in parts of Egypt there was a fear of these creatures as embodying spirits capable of great evil. People developed the mentality of bowing to incredibly horrible idols to drive away the bad spirits. Evil spirits are represented in the Book of Revelation in the forms of frogs (Rev 16:13). The frogs that the magicians produced could very well have been in the realm of evil spirits. Knowing how the Egyptians thought about this is hard to determine; but there is enough evidence to say that the plague would have made them spiritually as well as physically uncomfortable, and that the death of the frogs would have been a "sign" from God about their superstitions and related beliefs. The frog is associated with the god Hapi. And there was a frog-headed goddess Heqet who was supposed to assist women at childbirth. This all would have been evidence that Yahweh was controlling their environment and their religion, for his own purpose.<br>
 <a name="fn485" href="exo.htm#fnB485"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:25)  The text literally has "and seven days were fulfilled." Seven days gave Pharaoh enough time to repent and release Israel. When the week passed, God's second blow came.<br>
 <a name="fn486" href="exo.htm#fnB486"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:25)  This is a temporal clause made up of the preposition, the Hiphil<i> </i>infinitive construct of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hkn</FONT> (<i>naka</i>), <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toKh^</FONT> (<i>hakkot</i>), followed by the subjective genitive <i>YHWH.</i> Here the verb is applied to the true meaning of the plague: Moses struck the water, but the plague was a blow struck by God.<br>
 <a name="fn487" href="exo.htm#fnB487"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:26)  Beginning with <b>8:1</b>, the verse numbers through <b>8:32</b> in the English Bible differ from the verse numbers in the Hebrew text (<i>BHS</i>), with <b>8:1 </b>ET = <b>7:26</b> HT, <b>8:2 </b>ET = <b>7:27</b> HT, <b>8:3</b> ET = <b>7:28</b> HT, <b>8:4</b> ET = <b>7:29</b> HT, <b>8:5</b> ET = <b>8:1</b> HT, etc., through <b>8:32</b> ET = <b>8:28</b> HT. Thus in the English Bible ch. 8 has 32 verses, while in the Hebrew Bible it has 28 verses, with the four extra verses attached to ch. 7.<br>
 <a name="fn488" href="exo.htm#fnB488"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:2)  The construction here also uses the deictic particle and the participle to convey the imminent future: "I am going to plague/about to plague." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[gn</FONT> [<i>nagap</i>] means "to strike, to smite," and its related noun means "a blow, a plague, pestilence" or the like. For Yahweh to say "I am about to plague you" could just as easily mean "I am about to strike you." That is why these "plagues" can be described as "blows" received from God. <br>
 <a name="fn489" href="exo.htm#fnB489"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:2)  This word for frogs is mentioned only in the OT in conjunction with this plague (here, Ps 78:45, and Ps 105:30). Cole suggests that the word "frogs," <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yu!D=r+p^X= </FONT>(<i>s<sup>e</sup>pard<sup>e</sup>'im), </i>may be an onomatopoeic word, something like "croakers"; it is of Egyptian setting, and could be a Hebrew attempt to write the Arabic <i>dofda</i> (<i>Exodus</i>, p. 91). <br>
 <a name="fn490" href="exo.htm#fnB490"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:2)  <i>Heb</i> "plague all your borders with frogs." The expression "all your borders" is figurative for all the territory of Egypt and the people and the things that are in those territories (also used in Exod 10:4, 24, 29; 13:7).<br>
 <a name="fn491" href="exo.htm#fnB491"><sup>8</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:3)  The particular choice of this verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Jrv</FONT> (<i>saras</i>) recalls its use in the creation account (Gen 1:20).

The first three are for Pharaoh personally--they are going to touch his private life. Then the text mentions the servants and the people.

 <a name="fn494" href="exo.htm#fnB494"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:4)  The article again is the generic use of the article, designating the class--frogs.<br>
 <a name="fn495" href="exo.htm#fnB495"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:4)  The word order of the Hebrew text is important because it shows how the plague was primarily directed at Pharaoh: "and against [on] you, and against [on] your people, and against [on] all your servants frogs will go up."<br>

 <a name="fn497" href="exo.htm#fnB497"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:6)  The noun is singular, a collective. Jacob notes that this would be the more natural way to refer to the frogs (p. 260). <br>

The verb would be simply translated "honor yourself" or "deck yourself with honor." It can be used in the bad sense of self-exaltation. But here it seems to mean "have the honor or advantage over me" in choosing when to remove the frogs. The LXX has "appoint for me." Moses is doing more than extending a courtesy to Pharaoh; he is giving him the upper hand in choosing the time. But it is also a test, for if Pharaoh picked the time it would appear less likely that Moses was manipulating things. As Cassuto puts it, Moses is saying my trust in God is so strong you may have the honor of choosing the time (p. 103).<br>

 <a name="fn523" href="exo.htm#fnB523"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:16)  The verb is the perfect tense with the <i>vav</i> consecutive, meaning "and it will be." When <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hyh</FONT> (<i>haya</i>) is followed by the <i>lamed</i> proposition, it means "become." <br>

The older versions used "lice," which was the reading in the Peshitta and Targum (and so Josephus, <i>Antiq.</i> 2.14.3). The Greek and the Latin had "gnats." By "gnats" many commentators mean "mosquitoes," which in and around the water of Egypt were abundant (and the translators of the Greek text were familiar with Egypt). Whatever they were they came from the dust and were capable of flying. "Lice" is rejected because they are not that common in Egypt. B. Jacob argues against these views and prefers "sand fleas," because gnats do not derive from the dust nor do they afflict man or beast. There is no way to know for sure what they were. Most scholars would accept gnats to be the intention, or something like them, like mosquitoes.<br>

 <a name="fn527" href="exo.htm#fnB527"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:18)  The verb is the simple preterite with the <i>vav</i> consecutive, which would normally be translated "and they did." But the point of the pericope is that they were not able to do this.

 <a name="fn528" href="exo.htm#fnB528"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:18)  The infinitive construct <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ayX!ohl=</FONT> (<i>l<sup>e</sup>hosi'</i>), "to bring forth," functions as the direct object the verb, and therefore in apposition to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/K@</FONT> (<i>ken</i>), "thus, so" or "the same thing." It answers the question of what they tried to do.<br>
 <a name="fn529" href="exo.htm#fnB529"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:19)  <i>Heb</i> "and the magicians said."<br>
 <a name="fn530" href="exo.htm#fnB530"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:19)  The word "finger" is a bold anthropomorphism for God. Later, at the Sea, the reference will be to the "hand" of God. The point of the magicians' words is clear enough: had it been magic they could have duplicated it, but this was the power of God. The reason for their choice of the word "finger" has occasioned many theories, none of which are entirely satisfying. At the least it would mean it was done by God, with majestic ease and seemingly effortlessness.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (8:19)  The probable reason that they could not do this was that it was actually producing life--from the dust of the ground. The creative power of God confounded the magic of the Egyptians, and brought on them a loathsome plague. <br>
 <a name="fn531" href="exo.htm#fnB531"><sup>48</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:20)  The announcement of the fourth plague parallels the first plague. Now there will be flies. Egypt has always suffered from flies, more so in the summer than in the winter. But the flies the plague describes portrays something greater than any normal season for flies. The main point that can be stressed in this plague comes by tracing the development of the plagues in their sequence. Now, with the flies, we learn that God can inflict suffering on some people and preserve others--a preview of the coming judgment that will punish Egypt but set Israel free. God is fully able to keep the dog-fly in the land of the Egyptians, and save his people from these judgments. <br>
 <a name="fn532" href="exo.htm#fnB532"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:20)  <i>Heb</i> "And Yahweh said."<br>
 <a name="fn533" href="exo.htm#fnB533"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:21)  The construction uses the predicator of non existence--<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ya@</FONT> (<i>`en</i>), "there is not"--with a pronominal suffix prior to the Piel<i> </i>participle. The suffix becomes the subject of the clause. <i>Heb</i> it would say, "but if there is not you releasing." It emphasizes the verbal activity.<br>
 <a name="fn534" href="exo.htm#fnB534"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:21)  Here again is the <i>futur instans</i> use of the participle, now Qal with the simple meaning "send": <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">j~yl!v=m^ yn]n+h!</FONT> (<i>hin<sup>e</sup>ni masliah</i>), "here I am sending."<br>
 <a name="fn535" href="exo.htm#fnB535"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:21)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">br)u</FONT> (<i>`arob</i>) means "a mix" or "swarm." But clearly some insect is intended here. Whatever it means it must refer to some irritating kind of flying insect. Ps 78:45 says that the Egyptians were eaten or devoured by them. Some suggestions have been made over the years: 1) it could refer to beasts or reptiles, 2) the Greek took it as the dog-fly, a vicious blood-sucking gadfly, more common in the spring than in the fall, 3) the ordinary house fly, which is a symbol of Egypt in Isa 7:18 [Hebrew <i>z<sup>e</sup>bub</i>], and 4) the beetle, which gnaws and bites plants and animals and materials. The fly probably fits the details of this passage best; the plague would have greatly intensified a problem with flies that already existed.<br>
 <a name="fn536" href="exo.htm#fnB536"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:21)  Or perhaps "the land where they are."<br>

In Ps 139 it is used to describe how the body is uniquely made--distinct. The verb in the Hiphil means "to set apart, make separate." God was going to keep the flies away from Goshen--he was setting that apart. The Greek text assumed that the word was from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">alP</FONT> (<i>pale'</i>), and translated it something like "I will marvelously glorify."<br>
 <a name="fn538" href="exo.htm#fnB538"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:22)  The relative clause modifies the land of Goshen as the place "in which my people are dwelling." But the normal word for "dwelling" is not used here. Instead, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dm@u)</FONT> (<i>`omed</i>), "standing" (literally). The land on which Israel stood was spared the flies and the hail.<br>
 <a name="fn539" href="exo.htm#fnB539"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:23)  The word in the text is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">td%p=</FONT> (<i>p<sup>e</sup>dut</i>), "redemption." This would give the sense of making a distinction by redeeming Israel. The editors wish to read <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tl%p=</FONT> (<i>p<sup>e</sup>lut</i>) instead--"a separation, distinction" to match the verb above. G. I. Davies suggests that a letter was omitted, that the root was <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">drP</FONT> (<i>parad</i>), which would have left a noun formation of <i>prdt</i>, "separation." See G. I. Davies, "The Hebrew Text of Exodus VIII 19 [English 23]: An Emendation," <i>VT</i> 24 (1974): 489-92.<br>

 <a name="fn542" href="exo.htm#fnB542"><sup>59</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:24)  The word is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">db@K*</FONT> (<i>kabed</i>), which means "heavy, severe." Driver suggests using "heavy," since it combines both numerous (12:38) and severe (9:3, 18, 24). "Dense" or "thick" would also capture the idea.<br>
 <a name="fn543" href="exo.htm#fnB543"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:24)  Here, and in the next phrase, the word "house" has to be taken as an adverbial accusative of termination. <br>

 <a name="fn546" href="exo.htm#fnB546"><sup>63</sup></a><b>tc</b> (8:24)  The MT simply has "and in all the land of Egypt." Driver suggests reading with the LXX, SP, and Peshitta; this would call for adding a conjunction before the last clause to make it read, "into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants houses, and into all the land of Egypt; <b><i>and</i></b> the land was..." (p. 68). <br>
 <a name="fn547" href="exo.htm#fnB547"><sup>64</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:24)  <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tj@V*T!</FONT> (<i>tissahet</i>) is a strong word; it is the Niphal imperfect of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tjv</FONT> (<i>sahat</i>), and is translated "ruined." If the classification as imperfect stands, then it would have to be something like a customary imperfect (the land was being ruined); otherwise, it may simply be a preterite without the <i>vav</i> consecutive. Cassuto wonders if some of this material is not from an ancient poem in which such forms would be natural. Be that as it may, the verb describes utter devastation. This is the verb that is used in Gen 13 to describe how Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. Swarms of flies would disrupt life, contaminate life, and bring disease.<br>
 <a name="fn548" href="exo.htm#fnB548"><sup>65</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:25)  After the plague is inflicted on the land, then Pharaoh makes an appeal. So there is the familiar confrontation (vv. 25-29). Pharaoh's words to Moses are an advancement on his previous words. Now he uses imperatives: "Go, sacrifice to your God." But he restricts it to "in the [this] land." This is a subtle attempt to keep them as a subjugated people and prevent their absolute allegiance to their God. This offered compromise would destroy the point of the exodus--to leave Egypt and find a new allegiance under the LORD.<br>
 <a name="fn549" href="exo.htm#fnB549"><sup>66</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:26)  The clause is a little unusual in its formation. The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/okn*</FONT> (<i>nakon</i>) is the Niphal participle from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/WK</FONT> (<i>kun</i>), which usually means "firm, fixed, steadfast," but here it has a rare meaning of "right, fitting, appropriate." It functions in the sentence as the predicate adjective, because the infinitive <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">toCu&amp;l^</FONT> (<i>la'asot</i>) is the subject--"to do thus [that] is not right." <br>
 <a name="fn550" href="exo.htm#fnB550"><sup>67</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:26)  This translation has been smoothed out to capture the sense. The text literally says, "we sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians to Yahweh our God." In other words, the animals that Israel would sacrifice were sacred to Egypt, and their sacrificing them would have been an abomination to the Egyptians. <br>
 <a name="fn551" href="exo.htm#fnB551"><sup>68</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:26)  An "abomination" is something that is off-limits, something that is tabu. It could be translated "detestable" or "loathsome."<br>
 <a name="fn552" href="exo.htm#fnB552"><sup>69</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:26)  U. Cassuto says there are two ways to understand "the abominations of the Egyptians." One is that the sacrifice of the sacred animals would appear an abominable thing in the eyes of the Egyptians; and the other is that the word "abomination" could be a derogatory term for idols--we sacrifice the Egyptian idols (especially if they worship the bull). So that is why he says if they did this the Egyptians would stone them (p. 109). <br>
 <a name="fn553" href="exo.htm#fnB553"><sup>70</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:26)  <i>Heb</i> "if we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before them."<br>
 <a name="fn554" href="exo.htm#fnB554"><sup>71</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:26)  The interrogative clause has no particle to indicate it is a question, but it is connected with the conjunction to the preceding clause, and the meaning of these clauses indicate it is a question (GKC &#167;150.<i>a</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn555" href="exo.htm#fnB555"><sup>72</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:27)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">El@n@</FONT> (<i>nelek</i>) is a Qal imperfect of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Elh</FONT> (<i>halak</i>). Here it should be given the modal nuance of obligation: "we must go."<br>
 <a name="fn556" href="exo.htm#fnB556"><sup>73</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:27)  This clause is placed first in the sentence to stress the distance required. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Er#D#</FONT> (<i>derek</i>) is an adverbial accusative specifying how far they must go. It is in construct, so "three days" modifies it. It is a "journey of three days," or, "a three day journey."<br>
 <a name="fn557" href="exo.htm#fnB557"><sup>74</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:27)  The form is the perfect tense with a <i>vav</i> consecutive; it follows in the sequence: we must go...and then [must] sacrifice."<br>
 <a name="fn558" href="exo.htm#fnB558"><sup>75</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:27)  The form is the imperfect tense. It could be future: "as he will say to us"; but it also could be the progressive imperfect if this is now what God is telling them to do: "as he is saying to us."<br>
 <a name="fn559" href="exo.htm#fnB559"><sup>76</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:28)  By changing from "the people" to "you" the speech of the Pharaoh was becoming more personal.<br>
 <a name="fn560" href="exo.htm#fnB560"><sup>77</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:28)  This form, a perfect tense with the <i>vav</i> consecutive, is equivalent to the imperfect tense that precedes it. However, it must be subordinate to the preceding verb to express the purpose.

 <a name="fn561" href="exo.htm#fnB561"><sup>78</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:28)  The construction is very emphatic. First, it uses a verbal hendiadys with a Hiphil imperfect and the Qal infinitive construct: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tk#l#l* Wqyj!r+t^-aO</FONT> (<i>lo' tarhiqu laleket</i>)<i>, </i>"you will not make far to go" meaning, "you will not go far." But this prohibition is then emphasized with the additional infinitive absolute <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qj@r+h^</FONT> (<i>harheq</i>)--"you will in no wise go too far." The point is very strong to safeguard the concession.<i> </i><br>
 <a name="fn562" href="exo.htm#fnB562"><sup>79</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:28)  "Only" has been supplied here.<br>
 <a name="fn563" href="exo.htm#fnB563"><sup>80</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:29)  The deictic particle with the particle usually indicates the <i>futur instans </i>nuance: "I am about to...," or "I am going to...." The clause could also be subordinated as a temporal clause.<br>
 <a name="fn564" href="exo.htm#fnB564"><sup>81</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:29)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">llT</FONT> (<i>talal</i>) means "to mock, deceive, trifle with." The construction in this verse forms a verbal hendiadys again: the Hiphil jussive <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[s@y)-la^^</FONT> (<i>`al-yosep</i>), "let not [Pharaoh] add," is joined with the Hiphil infinitive of the main verb, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lt@h*</FONT> (<i>hatel</i>), "to deceive." It means: "Let not Pharaoh deceive again." Changing to the third person in this warning to Pharaoh is more decisive, more powerful. <br>
 <a name="fn565" href="exo.htm#fnB565"><sup>82</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:29)  The Piel infinitive construct after <i>lamed</i> (and the negative) functions epexegetically, explaining how Pharaoh would deal falsely--"by not releasing." <br>
 <a name="fn566" href="exo.htm#fnB566"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:1)  This plague demonstrates that Yahweh has power over the livestock of Egypt. He is able to strike the animals with disease and death, thus delivering a blow to the economical as well as religious life of the land. By the former plagues many of the Egyptian religious ceremonies would have been interrupted and objects of veneration defiled or destroyed. Now some of the important deities will be attacked. In Goshen, where the cattle are merely cattle, no disease hits; but in Egypt it is a different matter. Osiris, the savior, cannot even save the brute in which his own soul is supposed to reside. Apis and Mnevis, the ram of Ammon, the sheep of Sais, and the goat of Mendes, perish together. Hence, Moses reminds Israel afterwards, "On their gods also Yahweh executed judgments" (Num 33:4). And Jethro, when he heard of all these events, said, "Now I know that Yahweh is greater than all gods; for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly, he was above them" (Exod 18:11). <br>
 <a name="fn567" href="exo.htm#fnB567"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:2)  The object "them" is implied in the context.<br>
 <a name="fn568" href="exo.htm#fnB568"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:2)  <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dou</FONT> (<i>`od</i>), a simple adverb meaning "yet, still," can be inflected with suffixes and used as a predicator of existence, with the nuance "to still be, yet be" (T. Lambdin, <i>Introduction to Biblical Hebrew</i>, &#167;137). Then, it is joined here with the Hiphil participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qyz!j&amp;m^</FONT> (<i>mahaziq</i>), to form the sentence "you are still holding them." <br>

This is the only place in the OT that this form occurs. Ogden shows that this form is appropriate with the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hN@h!</FONT> to stress impending divine action, and that it conforms to the pattern in these narratives where five times the participle is used in the impending threat to Pharaoh (7:17; 8:2; 9:3, 14; 10:4).

 <a name="fn573" href="exo.htm#fnB573"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:4)  U. Cassuto observes that there is a word play in this section. A pestilence--<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rb#D#</FONT> (<i>deber</i>)--will fall on Egypt's cattle, but no thing--<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rb*D*</FONT> (<i>dabar</i>)--belonging to Israel would die.

 <a name="fn584" href="exo.htm#fnB584"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:8)  This sixth plague is unannounced. God simply instructs his servants to take handfuls of ashes from the Egyptians' furnaces and sprinkle them heavenward in the sight of Pharaoh. These ashes would become little particles of dust that would cause boils breaking out and festering on the Egyptians--man and beast. Hort ("Plagues," 101-103; and Lehrer in <i>Herzog's Cyclopedia</i>, suggest it is skin anthrax, because it is mostly affecting the lower extremities of the body, and because anthrax (anthracite coal) is especially suited for the black coal dust and soot (see Kaiser, p. 359). The lesson of this plague is that Yahweh has absolute control over the physical health of the people. Physical suffering consequent on sin comes to all regardless of their position and status. All people are helpless in the face of this. Now God was beginning to touch human life; greater judgments on human wickedness lay ahead. <br>

It may be connected to an Arabic cognate that means "to be hot." The illness was associated with Job (Job 2:7-8) and Hezekiah (Isa 38:21); it has also been connected with other skin diseases described especially in the Law. The word connected with it is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tu)B%u=b^a&amp;</FONT> (<i>`aba'bu'ot</i>); this means "blisters, pustules" and is sometimes translated as "festering." The etymology is debated, whether from a word meaning "to swell up" or "to overflow" (Kaiser, p. 359).<br>

 <a name="fn590" href="exo.htm#fnB590"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:13)  With the seventh plague there is more explanation of what God is doing to Pharaoh. God has demonstrated his power to this king, but now declares the truth of the matter so that Pharaoh would not miss the point. This plague begins with an extended lesson (vv. 13-21). Rain was almost unknown in Egypt, and hail and lightning were harmless. The Egyptians were fascinated by all these, though, and looked on them as portentious. Herodotus describes how they studied such things and wrote them down (1.2.c.38). If ordinary rainstorms were ominous, what must fire and hail have been? The Egyptians had denominated fire <i>Hephaistos</i>, considering it to be a mighty deity (cf. Diodorus, 1.1.c.1). Porphry says that at the opening of the temple of Serapis the Egyptians worship with water and fire. If these connections were clearly understood, then these elements in the plague were thought to be deities that came down on their own people with death and destruction. <br>
 <a name="fn591" href="exo.htm#fnB591"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:13)  <i>Heb</i> "and Yahweh said."<br>
 <a name="fn592" href="exo.htm#fnB592"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:13)  Or "take your stand."<br>
 <a name="fn593" href="exo.htm#fnB593"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:14)  The expression "all my plagues" points to the rest of the plagues and anticipates the proper outcome. Another view is to take the expression to mean the full brunt of the attack on the Egyptian people.<br>
 <a name="fn594" href="exo.htm#fnB594"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:14)  <i>Heb</i> "to your heart." The expression is unusual; but it may be an allusion to the hard heartedness of Pharaoh--his stubbornness and blindness (Jacob, <i>Exodus,</i> p. 274). <br>
 <a name="fn595" href="exo.htm#fnB595"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:15)  The verb is the Qal perfect <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yT!j=l^v</FONT> (<i>salahti</i>); but a past tense, or completed action translation does not fit the context at all. Gesenius lists this reference as an example of the use of the perfect to express actions and facts, whose accomplishment is to be represented not as actual but only as possible. He offers this for Exod 9:15: "I had almost put forth" (GKC &#167;106.<i>p</i>). Cassuto suggests, "I should have stretched out my hand." Others read the potential nuance instead, and render it as "I could have...."<br>
 <a name="fn596" href="exo.htm#fnB596"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:15)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">djK</FONT> (<i>kahad</i>) means "to hide, efface"; and in the Niphal it has the idea of "be effaced, ruined, destroyed." Here it will carry the nuance of the result of the preceding verbs: "I could have stretched out my hand...and struck you...and (as a result) you would have been destroyed." <br>
 <a name="fn597" href="exo.htm#fnB597"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:16)  The first word is a very strong adversative, which, in general, can be translated "but, howbeit"; BDB suggest for this passage "but in very deed."<br>

It would normally mean "I caused you to stand." But that seems to have one or two different connotations. Driver says that it means "maintain you alive." The causative of this verb means "continue," according to him (Driver, p. 73). The LXX has the same basic sense--"you were preserved." But Paul bypasses the Greek and writes "he raised you up" to show God's absolute sovereignty over Pharaoh. Both renderings show God's sovereign control over Pharaoh.<br>
 <a name="fn599" href="exo.htm#fnB599"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:16)  The Hiphil infinitive construct <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;t=a)r+h^ </FONT>(<i>har'oteka</i>) is the purpose of God's making Pharaoh come to power in the first place. The idea of making someone see is to cause someone to understand, to experience God's power. <br>
 <a name="fn600" href="exo.htm#fnB600"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:16)  The clause simply reads, "in order to declare my name." Since there is no expressed subject, this may be given a passive translation.<br>
 <a name="fn601" href="exo.htm#fnB601"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:17)  <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ll@oTs=m! </FONT>(<i>mistolel</i>) is a Hitpael<i> </i>participle, from the root which means "raise up, obstruct." So in the Hitpael it means to "raise oneself up," "elevate oneself," or "be an obstructionist." See Kaiser, p. 363; Cassuto, p. 116.<br>
 <a name="fn602" href="exo.htm#fnB602"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:17)  The infinitive construct with the <i>lamed</i> here expresses the epexegetical use; it explains how Pharaoh has exalted himself--"by not releasing the people."<br>

 <a name="fn618" href="exo.htm#fnB618"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:22)  The noun refers primarily to cultivated grains that grow in the fields. But in this passage it seems to be the general heading for anything that grows from the ground, all vegetation and plant life, as opposed to what grows on the trees.<br>
 <a name="fn619" href="exo.htm#fnB619"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:23)  The preterite with the <i>vav</i> consecutive is here subordinated to the next clause because of the consecutive.<br>

 <a name="fn621" href="exo.htm#fnB621"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:23)  The expression <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tl)q) /t^n* </FONT>(<i>natan qolot</i>) literally means "gives voices" (also "voice."). This is a poetic expression for sender the thundering. Ps 29 talks about the "voice of Yahweh"--the God of glory thunders! <br>
 <a name="fn622" href="exo.htm#fnB622"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:23)  This clause has been variously interpreted. It probably means that fire went along the ground from the pounding hail. Here fire and water were brought together in the judgment.<br>
 <a name="fn623" href="exo.htm#fnB623"><sup>58</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:24)  The verb is the common preterite <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yh!y+w~</FONT> (<i>wayhi</i>), which is normally translated "and there was" if it is translated at all. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hyh</FONT> (<i>haya</i>), however, can mean "be, become, befall, fall, fall out, happen." Here it could be simply translated "there was hail...," but the active "hail fell" fits the point of the sequence better.<br>
 <a name="fn624" href="exo.htm#fnB624"><sup>59</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:24)  The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tj^Q^l^t=m!</FONT> (<i>mitlaqqahat</i>) is the Hitpael participle; the clause would read "fire taking hold of itself in the midst of the hail." This probably refers to lightning flashing back and forth, or as kaiser says, zig-zagging. See also Ezek 1:4. God created a great storm with the flashing fire connected to it.<br>
 <a name="fn625" href="exo.htm#fnB625"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:24)  The phrase "the storm" is implied.<br>
 <a name="fn626" href="exo.htm#fnB626"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:24)  The literal reading of the clause would be: "which there was nothing like it in all the land of Egypt...." The relative pronoun must be joined to the resumptive pronoun to produce the translation: "which like it (like which) there had not been." For clarity and stylistic reasons this has been rendered as "more severe than any seen."<br>
 <a name="fn627" href="exo.htm#fnB627"><sup>62</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:25)  The exact expression is "from man even to beast." Williams lists this as an example of the inclusive use of the preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m!</FONT> (<i>min</i>) to be rendered "both...and" (see <i>Hebrew Syntax, </i>&#167;327). <br>
 <a name="fn628" href="exo.htm#fnB628"><sup>63</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:25)  <i>Heb</i> "all the cultivated grain of."<br>
 <a name="fn629" href="exo.htm#fnB629"><sup>64</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:27)  The Pharaoh now is struck by the judgment and acknowledges that he is at fault. But the context shows that this penitence was not long-lived. What exactly he meant by this confession is uncertain. On the surface his words seem to represent a recognition that he was in the wrong and Yahweh right.<br>
 <a name="fn630" href="exo.htm#fnB630"><sup>65</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:27)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">uv*r*</FONT> (<i>rasa'</i>) can mean "ungodly, wicked, guilty, criminal." Pharaoh here is saying that Yahweh is right, and they are not--so they are at fault, guilty. Driver says the words are used in their forensic sense and not in their ethical sense: in the right and in the wrong (p. 75).<br>
 <a name="fn631" href="exo.htm#fnB631"><sup>66</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:28)  The text has <i>Heb</i> "the voices of God." The divine epithet, like the divine name, can be used to express the superlative. <br>

This indicates that the storm was too much, or, as one would say, "it is enough." <br>
 <a name="fn633" href="exo.htm#fnB633"><sup>68</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:28)  The last clause uses a verbal hendiadys: "you will not add to stand," meaning "you will no longer stay."<br>
 <a name="fn634" href="exo.htm#fnB634"><sup>69</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:29)  <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yt!aX@K=</FONT> (<i>k<sup>e</sup>se'ti</i>) is the Qal infinitive construct of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aXy</FONT> (<i>yasa'</i>); it functions here as the temporal clause before the statement about prayer.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (9:29)  There has been a good deal of speculation as to why Moses had to leave the city before praying. Rashi said he did not want to pray where there were so many idols. It may also be as the midrash in <i>Exod. Rab.</i> 12:5 says: that most of the devastation of this plague had been outside in the fields, and that was where Moses wished to go and hold up the rod as he prayed--although the text says spread his palms.<br>
 <a name="fn635" href="exo.htm#fnB635"><sup>70</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:29)  This clause provides the purpose/result of Moses' intention: he will pray to Yahweh and the storms will cease "that you might know...." It was not enough to pray and have the plague stop. Pharaoh must "know" that Yahweh is the sovereign Lord over the earth. Here was that purpose of knowing through experience. This clause provides the key for the exposition of this plague: God demonstrated his power over the forces of nature to show his sovereignty--the earth is the Yahweh's. He can destroy it. He can preserve it. If people sin by ignoring his word and not fearing him, he can bring judgment on them. If any fear Yahweh and obey his instructions, they will be spared. A positive way to express the expositional point of the chapter is: those who fear Yahweh and obey his word will escape the powerful destruction he has prepared for those who sinfully disregard his word.<br>
 <a name="fn636" href="exo.htm#fnB636"><sup>71</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:30)  The verse begins with the disjunctive <i>vav</i> to mark a strong contrastive clause to what was said before this.<br>
 <a name="fn637" href="exo.htm#fnB637"><sup>72</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:30)  The adverb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;r#f#</FONT> (<i>terem</i>), "before," occurs with the imperfect tense to give the sense of the English present tense to the verb negated by it (GKC &#167;107.<i>c</i>). Moses is saying that he knew that Pharaoh did not really stand in aw of God, so as to grant Israel's release, i.e., fear not in the religious sense but "be afraid of" God--fear "before" him (Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, p. 76). <br>
 <a name="fn638" href="exo.htm#fnB638"><sup>73</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:31)  The disjunctive <i>vav</i> introduces the two verses that provide parenthetical information to the reader. Gesenius notes that the boldness of such clauses is often indicated by the repetition of nouns at the beginning (see GKC &#167;141.<i>d</i>). Some have concluded that because they have been put here rather than back after v. 25 or 26, they form part of Moses' speech to Pharaoh, explaining that the crops that were necessary for humans were spared, but those for other things were destroyed. This would also mean that Moses was saying there is more that God can destroy (see Jacob, p. 279).<br>
 <a name="fn639" href="exo.htm#fnB639"><sup>74</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:31)  The forms <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ht*K*n%</FONT> (<i>nukkata</i>) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WKn%</FONT> (<i>nukku</i>) are probably to be taken as old Qal passives rather than Pual forms, as the passive of Piel is not attested. The form was used as the passive of the Hiphil of this verb, but was not considered as a Hophal. There would be no appreciable difference in the meaning, unless it was given the translation "was ruined" rather than struck (the normal Hiphil meaning of this verb).<br>
 <a name="fn640" href="exo.htm#fnB640"><sup>75</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:31)  The words "by the hail" are not in the Hebrew text, but are supplied from context.<br>
 <a name="fn641" href="exo.htm#fnB641"><sup>76</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:31)  Flax was used for making linen; the area around Tanis was ideal for producing flax. Barley was used for bread for the poor people, as well as beer and animal feed. These crops would be coming up early in spring, after the severe or heavy winter rains. Rains in the spring of the strength described here would be very unlikely. <br>
 <a name="fn642" href="exo.htm#fnB642"><sup>77</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:32)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tm#S#K%</FONT> (<i>kussemet</i>) is translated "spelt"; the word occurs only here and in Isa 28:25 and Ezek 4:9. Spelt is a cereal closely allied to wheat. Other suggestions have been brought forward from the study of Egyptian crops (see a brief summary in Kaiser, pp 363,4).<br>
 <a name="fn643" href="exo.htm#fnB643"><sup>78</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:32)  <i>Heb</i> "for they are late."<br>
 <a name="fn644" href="exo.htm#fnB644"><sup>79</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:34)  The clause beginning with the preterite and <i>vav</i> consecutive is here subordinated to the next, and main clause--that he hardened his heart again.<br>
 <a name="fn645" href="exo.htm#fnB645"><sup>80</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:34)  The verbal construction is another verbal hendiadys: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aF)j&amp;l^ [s#Y)w~</FONT> (<i>wayyosep lahato'</i>), literally rendered "and he added to sin." The infinitive construct becomes the main verb, and the Hiphil preterite becomes adverbial. The text is clearly interpreting the hardening of Pharaoh's heart and his refusal to release Israel as sin. At the least this means that the plagues are his fault; but the expression probably means more than this--he was disobeying Yahweh God.<br>
 <a name="fn646" href="exo.htm#fnB646"><sup>81</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:35)  The verb used here is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qz^j$Y\w~</FONT> (<i>wayyehezaq</i>), the Qal preterite: "and it was hardened" or strengthened to resist. This forms the summary statement of this stage in the drama. But the verb that was used in the last clause to report Pharaoh's response was <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dB@k=Y~w~</FONT> (<i>wayyakbed</i>), the Hiphil preterite: "and he hardened [his heart]" or made it stubborn. <br>
 <a name="fn647" href="exo.htm#fnB647"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:1)  The Egyptians dreaded locusts like every other ancient civilization.

The locust-scaring deities of Greece and Asia were probably looked to in Egypt as well (especially in view of the origins in Egypt of so many of those religious ideas). But Yahweh, who gathers the winds in his fists, gathers the locusts together to plague Egypt severely. The announcement of the plague falls into the now-familiar pattern. God tells Moses to go and speak to Pharaoh, but reminds him that he has hardened his heart. Yahweh explains that he has done this so that he might show his power, that they might declare his name from generation to generation. This point is stressed so often that it must not be minimized. God was laying the foundation of the faith for Israel--the sovereignty of Yahweh.<br>

The clause explains an additional reason for God's hardening the heart of Pharaoh, namely, that they can tell (final imperfect showing purpose) their children of God's great wonders. The expression though is highly poetic, and intense--like Ps 44:1, which says, "we have heard with our ears." The emphasis would be on the clear teaching, orally, from one generation to another.<br>
 <a name="fn653" href="exo.htm#fnB653"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:2)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yT!l=L^u^t=h!</FONT> (<i>hit'allalti</i>) is a bold anthropomorphism. The word means to occupy oneself at another's expense, to toy with someone, which may be paraphrased with "mock." The whole point is that God is shaming and disgracing Egypt, making them look foolish in their arrogance and stubbornness (Kaiser, 366,7). Some prefer to translate it as "I have dealt ruthlessly" with Egypt (see Cassuto, p. 123).<br>

This provides another purpose for God's dealings with Egypt in the way that he was doing. The form is equal to the imperfect tense with the <i>vav </i>prefixed<i>; </i>it thus parallels the final imperfect that began v. 2--"that you might tell."<i> </i><br>
 <a name="fn658" href="exo.htm#fnB658"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:3)  The verb in this case is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">T*n+a^m@</FONT> (<i>me'anta</i>), a Piel<i> </i>perfect<i> </i>form. After "how long," the form should be classified as present perfect, for it describes actions and conditions begun or acquired previously (long ago) but have the effects continuing. It means here, "How long have you already been refusing (and refuse still)"--which really amounts to "how long will you refuse?" (See GKC &#167;106.<i>h</i>). <br>
 <a name="fn659" href="exo.htm#fnB659"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:3)  The entire clause is built on the use of the infinitive construct to express the direct object of the verb--it answers the question of what Pharaoh was refusing to do. The infinitive construct of the Niphal (note the elision of the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">h</FONT> after the preposition [see GKC &#167;51.<i>l</i>]) is from the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnu</FONT> (<i>`ana</i>). The verb in this stem would mean "humble oneself." The question is somewhat rhetorical, because since God was not yet through humbling Pharaoh, he would not then humble himself. Shortly, Pharaoh would surrender his stubborn will and release Israel.<br>

 <a name="fn663" href="exo.htm#fnB663"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:5)  The verbs throughout here describing the locusts are in the singular because it is a swarm or plague of locusts. This verb, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hS*k!w+</FONT> (<i>w<sup>e</sup>kissa</i>) is a Piel perfect with a <i>vav</i> consecutive; it carries the same future nuance then as the participle before it.

 <a name="fn664" href="exo.htm#fnB664"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:5)  <i>Heb</i> "eye," an unusual expression (see v. 15; Num 22:5, 11).<br>

The translation must be such as to indicate that there is no expressed subject of the verb. It could, therefore, be given a passive translation: "so that it could not be seen." And the whole clause is meant to be the result of the previous statement.<br>
 <a name="fn666" href="exo.htm#fnB666"><sup>20</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:5)  More precisely this would say "the remainder of what escaped" the previous plague. The locusts will devour everything, because there will not be much left from the other plagues for them to eat. <br>

The statement essentially says that no one could ever remember seeing a plague of locusts like this. In addition, see B. Childs, "A Study of the Formula, `Until this Day'," <i>JBL</i> 82 (1963).<br>
 <a name="fn671" href="exo.htm#fnB671"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:6)  <i>Heb</i> "he"; the referent (Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn672" href="exo.htm#fnB672"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:7)  The question of Pharaoh's servants reflects the question of Moses--"How long?" Now the servants of Pharaoh are demanding what Moses demanded--"Release the people." They know that the land is destroyed, and that it is Moses' doing. <br>
 <a name="fn673" href="exo.htm#fnB673"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:7)  The word "snare" is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vq@om</FONT> (<i>moqes</i>), a word used for catching birds. Here it is a figure for the cause of destroying Egypt. <br>

 <a name="fn675" href="exo.htm#fnB675"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:8)  The question is literally "who and who are the ones going?" ( <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yk!l=h)h^ ym!w&#180; ym!</FONT> [<i>mi wami hahol<sup>e</sup>kim</i>]). Pharaoh's answer to Moses includes this rude question, a question which was intended to say that he would control who went. It carries the force of saying, "Just who are the ones going?" The participle in this clause, then, refers to the future journey.<br>
 <a name="fn676" href="exo.htm#fnB676"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:9)  <i>Heb</i> "we have a pilgrim feast (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gj^ </FONT>[<i>hag</i>]) to Yahweh."<br>
 <a name="fn677" href="exo.htm#fnB677"><sup>31</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:10)  Pharaoh is by no means offering a blessing on them in the name of Yahweh. The meaning of his "wish" is connected to the next clause--as he is releasing them, may God help them. Driver says that the irony of these lines means that Yahweh is going to protect them as assuredly as he is going to let them go--not at all (p. 80). He is planning to keep the women and children as hostages to force the men to return. Cassuto paraphrases it this way: "May the help of your God be as far from you as I am from giving you permission to go forth with your little ones. The real irony, Cassuto observes, is that in the final analysis he will let them go, and Yahweh will be with them (p. 125). <br>
 <a name="fn678" href="exo.htm#fnB678"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:10)  The context requires that "the little ones" refer to women and children.<br>
 <a name="fn679" href="exo.htm#fnB679"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:10)  <i>Heb</i> "see."<br>
 <a name="fn680" href="exo.htm#fnB680"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:10)  Usually translated "before"; <i>Heb</i> "before your face."<br>
 <a name="fn681" href="exo.htm#fnB681"><sup>35</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:10)  The "evil" that is before them could refer to the evil that they are devising--the attempt to escape from Egypt. But that does not make much sense in the sentence--why would he tell them to take heed or look out about that. Cassuto's suggestion is better. He argues that Pharaoh is saying, "Don't push me too far." The evil, then, would be what Pharaoh was going to do if these men kept making demands on him. This fits the fact that he had them driven out of his court immediately. There could also be here an allusion to Pharaoh's god <i>Re'</i>, the sun-deity and head of the pantheon; he would be saying that the power of his god would confront them (see Cassuto, p. 126). <br>
 <a name="fn682" href="exo.htm#fnB682"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:11)  <i>Heb</i> "not thus."<br>
 <a name="fn683" href="exo.htm#fnB683"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:11)  The word now is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yr!b*G=h^</FONT> (<i>hagg<sup>e</sup>barim</i>), "the strong men." This word is distinctly "men," unlike the earlier word. Pharaoh appears to be conceding, but he is holding hostages. The word "only" has been supplied in the translation to indicate this. Jacob observes that Pharaoh here is furious, because Moses has pre-empted his move (p. 283).<br>
 <a name="fn684" href="exo.htm#fnB684"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:11)  The suffix on the sign of the accusative refers in a general sense to the idea contained in the preceding clause (see GKC &#167;135.<i>p</i>).<br>

 <a name="fn687" href="exo.htm#fnB687"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:11)  The verb is the Piel preterite, 3msg, meaning "and he drove them out." But "Pharaoh" cannot be the subject of the sentence, for that is the object of the preposition. The subject is not specified, and so the verb can be made passive.<br>
 <a name="fn688" href="exo.htm#fnB688"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:12)  The preposition <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B=</FONT> is unexpected here. BDB say that in this case it can only be read as "with the locusts," meaning that the locusts were thought to be implicit in Moses' lifting up of his hand. However, they prefer to change the preposition to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l=</FONT> (See p. 91, note).<br>
 <a name="fn689" href="exo.htm#fnB689"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:12)  As mentioned before, the noun is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bC#u@</FONT> (<i>`eseb</i>), which normally would indicate cultivated grains, but in this context seems to indicate every plant of the ground..<br>

In contrast to a normal sequence, this beginning focuses attention on Yahweh as the subject of the verb.<br>
 <a name="fn691" href="exo.htm#fnB691"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:13)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ghn</FONT> (<i>nahag</i>) means "drive, conduct." It is used for driving sheep, leading armies, or leading in processions. In the Piel stem it means "lead" or "guide"; but here and in Ps 78:26 (the wind that brought the quail) it has the idea of leading or guiding on a wind, or as Jacob says, "make a wind (Ps 104.4) and provide a way" (p. 283). <br>
 <a name="fn692" href="exo.htm#fnB692"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:13)  <i>Heb</i> "and the night."<br>
 <a name="fn693" href="exo.htm#fnB693"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:13)  The text chose not to use ordinary circumstantial clause constructions; rather, it says <i>Heb</i> "the morning was, and the east wind brought the locusts." It clearly means "when it was morning"; but the style has chosen a more abrupt beginning to the plague, as if the reader is in the experience--and at morning, the locusts are there!<br>
 <a name="fn694" href="exo.htm#fnB694"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:13)  The verb here is a past perfect use of the tense, indicting that the locusts had arrived before the day came.<br>
 <a name="fn695" href="exo.htm#fnB695"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:14)  <i>Heb</i> "border."<br>
 <a name="fn696" href="exo.htm#fnB696"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:14)  This is an interpretive translation. The clause simply has <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">da)m= db@K*</FONT> (<i>kabed m<sup>e</sup>'od</i>), the stative verb with the adverb--"it was very heavy." If the plague of locusts was severe, it must mean there were vast numbers of locusts, for the plague is in the numbers.<br>
 <a name="fn697" href="exo.htm#fnB697"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:14)  <i>Heb</i> "after them."<br>

 <a name="fn699" href="exo.htm#fnB699"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:15)  The verb is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ev^j=T#w~</FONT> (<i>wattehsak</i>), "and it became dark." The idea is that the ground was hidden because of the swarms of locusts that covered it. <br>
 <a name="fn700" href="exo.htm#fnB700"><sup>54</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:16)  The third part of the passage now begins, the confrontation that resulted from the onslaught of the plague. Pharaoh goes a step further here--he confesses he has sinned and adds a request for forgiveness. But his acknowledgment does not go far enough, for this is not genuine confession. Since his heart was not yet submissive, his confession was vain.<br>
 <a name="fn701" href="exo.htm#fnB701"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:16)  The Piel preterite <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rh@m^y+w~</FONT> (<i>waymaher</i>) could be translated "and he hastened"; but here it is joined with the following infinitive construct to form the hendiadys. "He hurried to summon" means "He summoned quickly." <br>
 <a name="fn702" href="exo.htm#fnB702"><sup>56</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:16)  The severity of the plague prompted Pharaoh to confess his sin against Yahweh and them, now in much stronger terms than before. He also wants forgiveness--but in all probability what he wants is relief from the consequences of his sin. He pretended to convey to Moses that this was it, that he was through sinning, so he asked for forgiveness "only this time." <br>
 <a name="fn703" href="exo.htm#fnB703"><sup>57</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:17)  "Death" is a metonymy of effect. He means the locusts--but if the locusts are left in the land it will be death to everything that grows. <br>
 <a name="fn704" href="exo.htm#fnB704"><sup>58</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:17)  Pharaohs' double emphasis on "only" is meant to deceive. He was trying to give Moses the impression that he had finally come to his senses, and that he would let the people go. But he had no intention of letting them out.<br>
 <a name="fn705" href="exo.htm#fnB705"><sup>59</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:18)  <i>Heb</i> "and he"; the referent (Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>

 <a name="fn707" href="exo.htm#fnB707"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:19)  Or "west wind." <br>
 <a name="fn708" href="exo.htm#fnB708"><sup>62</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:19)  Traditionally "the Red Sea." "Reed" is a better translation of the Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[Ws</FONT>, usually rendered "red." The name <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[Ws &lt;y~</FONT><i> </i>(<i>Yam Suph</i>), here with the directive <i>he'</i>, refers to the waterway between Egypt and the Sinai, which some scholars identify with the southern part of Lake Menzaleh.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (10:19)  The <i>Sea of Reeds</i> was deep enough to drown the entire Egyptian army later (and thus no shallow swamp land). So God drove all the locusts to their death in the water. He will have the same power with Egypt, for he raised up this powerful empire for a purpose, but soon will drown them in the sea. The message for the Israelites is that God will humble all those who refuse to submit.<br>
 <a name="fn709" href="exo.htm#fnB709"><sup>63</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:21)  The ninth plague is that darkness fell on all the land--except on Israel. This plague is comparable to the silence in heaven, just prior to the last and terrible plague. Here Yahweh is destroying Egypt's main religious belief as well as portraying what lay before them. Throughout the Bible darkness is the symbol of evil, chaos, and judgment. Blindness is one of its manifestations (see Deut 28:27-29). But the plague here is not blindness, or even spiritual blindness, but an awesome darkness from outside (see Joel 2:2; Zeph 1:15). Here the plague is particularly significant in that Egypt's high god was the Sun God. Lord Sun was now being shut down by Lord Yahweh. If Egypt would not let Israel go to worship their God, then Egypt's god would be darkness. The structure should be familiar by now for the plagues: the plague, now unannounced (21-23) and then the confrontation with Pharaoh (24-27).<br>
 <a name="fn710" href="exo.htm#fnB710"><sup>64</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:21)  Or "the sky" (also in the following verse). The same Hebrew term, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;y]m^v*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">v*m^y]&lt;</FONT>), may be translated "heavens" or "sky" depending on the context.<br>
 <a name="fn711" href="exo.htm#fnB711"><sup>65</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:21)  The verb form is the jussive with the sequential <i>vav</i>--<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ev#j) yh!yw]</FONT> (<i>wihi hosek</i>). Jacob points out that only here we have "let there be darkness" (although it is subordinated as a purpose clause). Isa 45:7 referred to this by saying, "who created light and darkness" (Jacob, p. 286).<br>
 <a name="fn712" href="exo.htm#fnB712"><sup>66</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:21)  The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vWm</FONT> (<i>mus</i>) means "to feel." The literal rendering would be "so that one may feel darkness." The image portrays an oppressive darkness; it was sufficiently thick to possess the appearance of substance, although it was just air (Jacob, p. 286). <br>
 <a name="fn713" href="exo.htm#fnB713"><sup>67</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:22)  The construction is a variation of the superlative genitive: one substantive in the construct state is connected to a noun of the same meaning (see GKC &#167;133.<i>i</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn714" href="exo.htm#fnB714"><sup>68</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:22)  Driver says, "The darkness was no doubt occasioned really by a <i>sand-storm</i>, produced by the hot electrical wind...which blows in intermittently... ( 82, 83). This is another application of the antisupernatural approach to these texts. Kaiser apparently agrees with this interpretation to say that "no doubt" God used this seasonal wind that darkens the sky (p. 367). The text, however, is probably describing something that was not a seasonal wind, or Pharaoh would not have been intimidated. If it coincided with that season, then what is described here is so different and so powerful that the Egyptians would have known the difference rather easily. Pharaoh here would have had to have been impressed that this was something very different, and that his god was powerless. Besides, there was light in all the dwellings of the Israelites. <br>
 <a name="fn715" href="exo.htm#fnB715"><sup>69</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:23)  <i>Heb</i> "a man...his brother."<br>
 <a name="fn716" href="exo.htm#fnB716"><sup>70</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:23)  The perfect tense in this context requires the somewhat rare classification of a potential perfect.<br>
 <a name="fn717" href="exo.htm#fnB717"><sup>71</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:24)  The text has "your little ones," but as mentioned before, this expression in these passages means women and children, not just toddlers. Pharaoh will now let them all go, but he will detain the cattle for security against their return. <br>
 <a name="fn718" href="exo.htm#fnB718"><sup>72</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:25)  Jacob shows that the intent of Moses in using <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;G^</FONT> (<i>gam</i>) is to make an emphatic rhetorical question. He cites other samples of the usage in Num 22:33; 1 Sam 17:36; 2 Sam 12:14, and others. The point is that if Pharaoh told them to go and serve Yahweh, they had to have animals to sacrifice. If Pharaoh was holding the animals back, he would have to make some provision (Jacob, p. 287).<br>
 <a name="fn719" href="exo.htm#fnB719"><sup>73</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:25)  <i>Heb</i> "give into our hand."<br>
 <a name="fn720" href="exo.htm#fnB720"><sup>74</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:25)  The form here is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WnyC!uw+</FONT> (<i>w<sup>e</sup>'asinu</i>), the Qal perfect with a <i>vav</i> consecutive--"and we will do." But the verb means "do" in the sacrificial sense--prepare them, offer them. The verb form is to be subordinated here to form a purpose or result clause.<br>

 <a name="fn731" href="exo.htm#fnB731"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (11:1)  The last plague is the most severe; it is that for which all the others were preliminary warnings. Up to this point Yahweh had been showing his power to destroy Pharaoh, and now he would begin to do so by bringing death to the Egyptians, a death that would fulfill the warning of talionic judgment--"let my son go, or I will kill your son." The passage records the announcement of the judgment first to Moses and then through Moses to Pharaoh. The first two verses record the word of God to Moses. This is followed by a parenthetical note how God had elevated Moses and Israel in the eye of Egypt (v. 3). Then there is the announcement to Pharaoh (vv. 4-8). This is followed by a parenthetical note on how God had hardened Pharaoh so that Yahweh would be elevated over him. It is somewhat problematic here that Moses does appear before Pharaoh again. On the one hand, given the nature of Pharaoh to blow hot and cold, to change his mind, it is not impossible for another meeting to have occurred. But Moses said he would not do it. So there are some solutions. One solution some take is to say that the warning in 10:28 originally stood after this chapter. A change like that is unwarranted, and without support. If a smooth translation is required that would not have a subsequent meeting, then vv. 1-3 could be parenthetical, and put into the past perfect translation--Yahweh had said to Moses--so that v. 4 follows immediately on 10:29 in the chronology. <br>

It seems to say, "as/when he releases [you] altogether." The LXX has "and when he sends you forth with everything." <i>Targum Onqelos</i> and modern translators made <i>kala</i> adverbial, "completely" or "altogether." Childs follows an emendation to read, "as one sends away a bride" (p. 130). Kaiser prefers the view of Yaron that would render it "in the manner of one's sending away a <i>kallah</i> [a slave purchased to be one's daughter-in-law]" (p. 370). The last two readings call for revising the vocalization and introducing a rare word into the narrative meaning. The simplest approach at the moment is to follow a meaning "when he releases [you] altogether," i.e., with all your little ones and your livestock.<br>

 <a name="fn742" href="exo.htm#fnB742"><sup>12</sup></a><b>sn</b> (11:5)  The firstborn in these cultures is rather significant; but <i>the firstborn of Pharaoh</i> is most important. Pharaoh was considered a god, the son of Re, the sun god, for the specific purpose of ruling over Re's chief concern, the land of Egypt. For the purpose of re-creation, the supreme god assumed the form of the living king and gave seed which was to become the next king and the next "son of Re." Moreover, the Pharaoh was the incarnation of the god Horus, a falcon god whose provenance was the heavens. Horus represented the living king who succeeded the dead king Osiris. Every living king was Horus; every dead king Osiris (see J. A. Wilson, "Egypt," in <i>Before Philosophy</i>, ed. Henri Frankfort, et al, 83ff.). To strike the firstborn son of Pharaoh was to destroy this cardinal doctrine of the divine kingship of Egypt. And to strike any firstborn was to destroy the heir, the hopes and aspirations, of the Egyptians. Such a blow would be enough for Pharaoh, for then he would drive them out.<br>

It is possible this is to be related to the watchdog (see F. C. Fensham, "Remarks on Keret 114<sup>b</sup>--136<sup>a</sup>," <i>JNSL</i> 11 [1983]: 75).<br>

Moreover, the celebration of this festival of passover was to become a central part of the holy calendar of Israel. The contents of this chapter will obviously have significance for NT studies as well since the passover was a type of the death of Jesus. The structure of this whole section before the crossing of the sea is as follows: the institution of the passover (12:1-28), the night of farewell and departure (12:29-42), slaves and strangers (12:43-51), and the laws of the firstborn (13:1-16). In this immediate section there is the institution of the Passover itself (12:1-13), then the Unleavened Bread (12:14-20), and then the report of the response of the people (12:21-28). <br>

 <a name="fn755" href="exo.htm#fnB755"><sup>5</sup></a><b>sn</b> (12:2)  B. Jacob shows that the intent of the passage was not to make this month in the springtime the New Year--that was in the autumn. Rather, when counting the months of the years this was supposed to be remembered first, for it was the great festival of freedom from Egypt. He observes how some scholars have unnecessarily tried to date one New Year earlier than the other (pp. 294-95).<br>
 <a name="fn756" href="exo.htm#fnB756"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:3)  The text says, "and they will take for themselves a man a lamb." This is clearly the distributive sense of "man."<br>

 <a name="fn761" href="exo.htm#fnB761"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:4)  The clause uses the comparative <i>min</i> construction: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hC#m! ty)h=m! ty]B^h^ fu^m=y]</FONT> (<i>yim'at habbayit mihyot misseh</i>, "the house is small from being for a lamb," or "too small for a lamb"). It clearly means that if there are not enough people in the household to have a lamb by themselves, they should join with another family.

 <a name="fn764" href="exo.htm#fnB764"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:4)  The construction uses a perfect tense with a <i>vav</i> consecutive after a conditional clause: "if the household is too small...then he and his neighbor will take...."<br>

 <b>sn</b> (12:4)  The reference is normally taken to mean whatever each person could eat. B. Jacob suggests, however, that the reference may not be to each individual person's appetite, but to each family. Each man who is the head of a household was to determine how much his family could eat, and this in turn would determine how many families shared the lamb (see Jacob, p. 299).<br>
 <a name="fn766" href="exo.htm#fnB766"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:5)  The construction has: "[The] animal...will be to you." This may be interpreted as a possessive use of the <i>lamed</i>, meaning, "[the] animal...you have" (your animal) for the passover. In the context instructing the people to take an animal for this festival, the idea here is the one they take or choose, their animal, must meet these qualifications. Jacob simply renders it, "A perfect male lamb one year old shall it be"; but this leaves out "to you." Cassuto has, "your lamb shall be without blemish...."<br>
 <a name="fn767" href="exo.htm#fnB767"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:5)  The Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ym!T*</FONT> (<i>tamim</i>) means "perfect" or "whole" or "complete" in the sense of not having blemishes and diseases--no physical defects.

 <a name="fn768" href="exo.htm#fnB768"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:5)  The idiom says "a son of a year" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hn*v*-/B#</FONT> [<i>ben sana</i>]), meaning, a "yearling" or "one year old" (see GKC &#167;128.<i>v</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn769" href="exo.htm#fnB769"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:5)  Because a choice is being given here in this last clause, the imperfect tense nuance of permission should be used. They must have a perfect animal, but it may be a sheep or a goat. The verb's object "it" is supplied from the context.<br>
 <a name="fn770" href="exo.htm#fnB770"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:6)  The text has <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tr#m#v=m!l= &lt;k#l hy&#180;h*w+</FONT> (<i>w<sup>e</sup>haya lakem mismeret</i>), "and it will be for you for a keeping." This noun stresses the activity of watching over or caring for something, probably to keep it in its proper condition for its designated use (see 16:23, 32-34).<br>

 <a name="fn772" href="exo.htm#fnB772"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:6)  The expression "all the congregation of the assembly" is a pleonasm. The verse means that the whole congregation will kill the lamb, i.e., each family unit within the congregation will kill its animal.<br>

 <a name="fn774" href="exo.htm#fnB774"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:6)  The expression "between the evenings" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;y]Br+u^h /yB@</FONT> [<i>ben ha'arbayim</i>]) has had a good deal of discussion. There are several predominant views. (1) <i>Targum Onqelos</i> says "between the two suns," which the Talmud explains as the time between the sunset and the time the stars become visible. More technically, the first "evening" would be the time between sunset and the appearance of the crescent moon, and the second "evening" the next hour, or from the appearance of the crescent moon to full darkness (see Deut 16:6--"at the going down of the sun"). (2) Saadia, Rashi, and Kimchi say the first evening is when the sun begins to decline in the west and cast its shadows, and the second evening is the beginning of night. (3) The traditional view, adopted by the Pharisees and the Talmudists (<i>b. Pesahim 61a</i>), was that the first evening was when the heat of the sun began to decrease, and the second evening began at sunset, or, roughly, from 3-5 P.M. The Mishnah (<i>m. Pesahim </i>5:1) indicates it was killed about 2:30 P.M.--anything before noon was not valid. Driver concludes from this survey that the first view is probably the best, although the last view was the traditionally accepted view (pp. 89-90).<br>
 <a name="fn775" href="exo.htm#fnB775"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:8)  <i>Heb</i> "this night."<br>
 <a name="fn776" href="exo.htm#fnB776"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (12:8)  The word translated <i>cakes </i>is plural, and so it must refer to the round pan cakes of the unleavened bread. These are the kinds of breads that could be baked quickly, not allowing time for the use of leaven. In Deut 16:3 the unleavened cakes are called "the bread of affliction," which meant the alarm and the haste of the Israelites. In later Judaism and in the writings of Paul, leaven came to be a type of evil or corruption, and so "unleavened bread" was interpreted to be a picture of purity or freedom from corruption or defilement (Driver, pp. 90-91).<br>
 <a name="fn777" href="exo.htm#fnB777"><sup>27</sup></a><b>sn</b> (12:9)  This ruling was to prevent their eating it just softened by the fire or partially roasted as differing customs might prescribe or allow.<br>

 <a name="fn780" href="exo.htm#fnB780"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:11)  Driver argues that "haste" is not fully accurate. He suggests "trepidation," that mixture of hurry and alarm. In Deut 20:3 it is connected to "tremble."<br>
 <a name="fn781" href="exo.htm#fnB781"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:11)  The meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">js^P#</FONT> (<i>pesah</i>) is debated. (1) Some have tried to connect it to the Hebrew verb of the same radicals that means "to halt, leap, limp, stumble." See 1 Kgs 18:21 where the word describes the priests of Baal cavorting around the altar; also the crippled child in 2 Sam 4:4. (2) Others connect it to the Akkadian <i>passahu</i>, which means "to appease, make soft, placate"; or (3) an Egyptian word to commemorate the harvest (see Segal, <i>The Passover</i>, 95-100). The verb occurs in Isa 31:5 with the connotation of "to protect"; Childs suggests that this was already influenced by the Exodus tradition (<i>Exodus, </i>p. 183, n. 11). Whatever links there may or may not have been in the word that show an etymology, in this passage it is describing Yahweh's passing over or through.<br>
 <a name="fn782" href="exo.htm#fnB782"><sup>32</sup></a><b>sn</b> (12:11)  The entire section of these instructions for the Passover is useful to the Christian expositor, for Paul simply announced that Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us, and therefore we must keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread--a life of holiness.. Christian expositors down through the years have been able to see the clear connections between Exod 12 and the Gospel--deliverance from bondage by the blood of the lamb, the lamb without blemish, salvation from judgment by the angel of death, and the details of the time of the sacrifice of Christ as the Passover Lamb on Good Friday at 3 P.M. Here, the large picture as well as the details fit the typology of the death of Christ. And, the fact that the last Supper was a passover meal in which Jesus explained the full meaning of it all adds to the completion. A related area of correspondence between the testaments is the image of "son." Christ is the "only begotten Son" but also the Passover Lamb. So in the fulfillment of the Lamb that brings redemption we also have the Son, the Seed of Abraham. When OT images overlap like this, the expositor is confronted with the richness of the eternal plan of God revealed in Scripture. In Exodus the firstborn die as part of the judgment of God on the world; in the NT the "son" dies in our place, so that we might live. For additional material on these themes, see P. R. Davies, "The Sacrifice of Isaac and Passover," <i>StudBib<b> </b></i>(1979): 127-32; and "Passover and the Dating of the Aqedah," <i>JJS</i> 30 (1979): 59-67.<br>

The statement clearly includes what had begun in Exod 6:1. But the statement that God would judge the gods of Egypt is appropriately introduced here (see also Num 33:4) because with the judgment on Pharaoh and the deliverance from bondage, Yahweh would truly show to be the one true God. Thus, "I am Yahweh" is fitting here (see Jacob, p. 312).<br>

 <a name="fn790" href="exo.htm#fnB790"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:13)  The meaning of the verb is supplied in part from the obvious meaning of the context as well as the previous verb "pass through, by, over." Isa 31:5 says, "As birds flying, so will Yahweh protect Jerusalem: he will protect and deliver, he will <i>pass over</i> and rescue." The word does not occur enough times to enable one to develop a clear meaning. It is probably not the same word as "to limp" found in 1 Kgs 18:21, 26, unless there is a highly developed category of meaning there.<br>

It usually describes a calamity or affliction given to those who have aroused God's anger, such as Exod 30:12; Num 8:19; 16:46, 47; Josh 22:17 (Driver, pp. 92-93).<br>

It can be paraphrased "to destroy [you]" but would be more properly rendered "(for) a destroyer" or "for destruction." The word itself is a harsh term; it was used to describe Yahweh's destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen 13:10).<br>

 <b>sn</b> (12:14)  The instruction for the Unleavened Bread (vv. 14-20) begins with the introduction of the <i>memorial</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/orK*z!</FONT> [<i>zikkaron</i>], from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rkz</FONT> [<i>zakar</i>]). The reference is to the fifteenth day of the month, the beginning of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Jacob notes that it refers to the death blow on Egypt, but as a remembrance had to be held on the next day, not during the night. He also notes that this was the origin of "the Day of the LORD" ("the Day of Yahweh") which the prophets predicted as the day of the divine battle. On it the enemy would be wiped out (Jacob, p. 315). For further information, see B. Childs, <i>Memory and Tradition</i>. The point of the word "remember" in Hebrew is not simply a recollection of an event, but a reliving of it, a reactivating of its significance. In covenant rituals "remembrance" or "memorial" is designed to prompt God and worshiper alike to act in accordance with the covenant. Jesus brought the motif forward to the new covenant with "this do in remembrance of me."<br>

Suggested connections to known verbs include "to squeeze, press," "to depart, go out," "to ransom," or to an Egyptian word "food, cake, evening meal." For a more detailed study of "unleavened bread" and related matters such as "yeast" or "leaven," see A. P. Ross, "Bread, Cake," in <i>NIDOTTE</i> 4:448-53.<br>
 <a name="fn802" href="exo.htm#fnB802"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:15)  The particle serves to emphasize, not restrict here (Childs, p. 183, n. 15).<br>

 <a name="fn804" href="exo.htm#fnB804"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:15)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ht*r+k=n]w+</FONT> (<i>w<sup>e</sup>nikr<sup>e</sup>ta</i>) is the Niphal perfect with the <i>vav</i> consecutive; it is a common formula in the Law for divine punishment. Here, in sequence to the idea that someone might eat leavened bread, the result would be that "that soul [the verb is feminine] will be cut off." The verb is the equivalent of the imperfect tense due to the consecutive; a translation with a nuance of the imperfect of possibility fits better than a specific future. There is the real danger of being cut off, for while the punishment might include excommunication from the community, the real danger was in the possibility of divine intervention to root out the evildoer (Driver, p. 94). Gesenius lists this as the use of a perfect with a <i>vav</i> consecutive after a participle (a <i>casus pendens) </i>to introduce the apodosis (GKC &#167;112.<i>mm</i>).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (12:15)  Concerning the use of leaven, Jacob writes, "This prohibition against leaven, with its slight intoxicating effect, and the command to eat bitter herbs, displayed an extraordinary sensitivity to any stimulation (compare with Exod 20:25f.). The ancient Israelite experience considered all luxury and opulence as vulgar and barbaric; enjoyment led to vulgarity, while restraint to nobility and priestly holiness" (p. 319).<br>
 <a name="fn805" href="exo.htm#fnB805"><sup>55</sup></a><b>sn</b> (12:16)  This refers to an assembly of the people at the sanctuary for religious purposes. The word "convocation" implies that the people were called together; and Num 10:2 indicates they were called together by trumpets.<br>
 <a name="fn806" href="exo.htm#fnB806"><sup>56</sup></a><b><i>tn</i></b> <i>Heb</i> "all/every work will not be done." The word refers primarily to the work of one's occupation. Jacob explains that since this comes prior to the fuller description of laws for sabbaths and festivals, the passage simply restricts all work except for the preparation of food. Once the laws are added, this qualification is no longer needed (p. 322). Gesenius translates this as "no manner of work shall be done" (GKC &#167;152.<i>b</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn807" href="exo.htm#fnB807"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:17)  The word means "bone"; the expression then means "the substance of the day," the day itself, the very day (Driver, p. 95).<br>

 <a name="fn814" href="exo.htm#fnB814"><sup>64</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:19)  The term refers to the one who is native born in the land. Jacob argues that since the "stranger" also was born in the land, the distinction has to be greater. The natural citizen is the one who has ancestors who came out of Egypt by the exodus (p. 324).<br>
 <a name="fn815" href="exo.htm#fnB815"><sup>65</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:21)  The verb means "to draw a lamb out of the fold."<br>
 <a name="fn816" href="exo.htm#fnB816"><sup>66</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:21)  The noun is singular, a lamb or a goat; but the context is addressing the people who each would be taking a small animal.<br>

 <a name="fn823" href="exo.htm#fnB823"><sup>73</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:25)  The verb used here and at the beginning of v. 24 is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rmv</FONT> (<i>samar</i>); this can be translated "watch, keep, protect" but in this context "observe" the religious customs and practices set forth in these instructions. Judaism, of course, has complied with this injunction by including these details in the Passover Haggadah (the "telling").<br>
 <a name="fn824" href="exo.htm#fnB824"><sup>74</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:26)  <i>Heb</i> "what is this service to you?"<br>
 <a name="fn825" href="exo.htm#fnB825"><sup>75</sup></a><b>sn</b> (12:27)  This expression "the sacrifice of Yahweh's passover" occurs only here. The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jb^z#</FONT> (<i>zebah</i>) means "slaughtering" and so a blood sacrifice. The fact that this word is used in Lev 3 for the peace offering has linked the Passover as a kind of peace offering, both of which were eaten as communal meals.<br>
 <a name="fn826" href="exo.htm#fnB826"><sup>76</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:27)  The verb means "to strike, smite, plague"; it is the same verb that has been used throughout this section (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[gn</FONT> [<i>nagap</i>]). Here the construction is the infinitive construct in a temporal clause.<br>
 <a name="fn827" href="exo.htm#fnB827"><sup>77</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:27)  The two verbs form a verbal hendiadys: "and the people bowed down and they worshiped." Both words are synonyms, and so one is taken as the adverb for the other.<br>
 <a name="fn828" href="exo.htm#fnB828"><sup>78</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:28)  <i>Heb</i> "went away and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did." The final phrase "so they did," which is somewhat redundant in English, has been represented in the translation by the adverb "exactly."<br>
 <a name="fn829" href="exo.htm#fnB829"><sup>79</sup></a><b>sn</b> (12:29)  The next section records the deliverance of Israel from Egypt, and so becomes the turning point of the book. Verses 28 and 29 could be included in the exposition of the previous section as the culmination of that part: the message developed God's requirement for deliverance from bondage through the application of the blood of the sacrifice, God's instruction for the memorial of deliverance through the purging of corruption, and the compliance of those who believed the message. But these verses also form the beginning of this section (and so could be used transitionally). This unit includes the judgment on Egypt (29,20), the exodus from Egypt (31-39) and the historical summation and report (40-42).<br>
 <a name="fn830" href="exo.htm#fnB830"><sup>80</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:29)  The verse begins with the temporal indicator <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yh!y+w~</FONT> (<i>wayhi</i>), so often translated, "and it came to pass." Here it could be left untranslated: "In the middle of the night Yahweh struck." The word order of the next and main clause provides the emphasis: "and/that Yahweh struck"--the <i>vav</i> disjunctive on the divine name preceding the verb. The sentence clearly states that Yahweh struck the firstborn in the middle of the night; but the emphasis on Yahweh, and on the suddenness of the attack at mid-night, can be reflected in the translation.<br>
 <a name="fn831" href="exo.htm#fnB831"><sup>81</sup></a><b>sn</b> (12:29)  The plague struck in total darkness, when they were at their deepest rest, contributing to the terror of it. Unlike previous verses that talk of a plague or a destroyer, here only the stark "attack (kill)" is used with no explanation. Sudden death, with no apparent cause or warning was a frightening divine secret (Jacob, p. 334). He adds that the Torah is not concerned with the explanations, only with the defeat of a tyrant and the deliverance of the covenant people. Contemporary scholars who propose natural phenomena for explanations of such things have suggested a couple of causes for this. Some who wish to see the Passover as a Hebrew development of an earlier harvest festival are troubled by the death of the humans, for only firstborn animals were offered in those rites. Others like Driver suggest a commonly occurring epidemic struck in the middle of the night. He even suggests that people report these breaking out in the spring time (p. 98). This is surely carrying the natural explanation too far. At least Driver quotes Dillmann as saying, "the plague here, by its momentary suddenness, as also by its carrying off as its victims exclusively the first-born of the Egyptians, bears a wholly supernatural character..." (p. 99)--but then the quote goes on to say how this tradition might have grown up. Jacob rightly says that all this is theoretical and without basis, and reverses matters completely (p. 335).<br>
 <a name="fn832" href="exo.htm#fnB832"><sup>82</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:30)  <i>Heb</i> "arose," the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;Wq</FONT> (<i>qum</i>) in this context certainly must describe a less ceremonial act. The entire country woke up in terror because of the deaths.<br>
 <a name="fn833" href="exo.htm#fnB833"><sup>83</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:30)  The noun is an adverbial accusative of time--"<i>in the </i>night" or "<i>at </i>night."<br>
 <a name="fn834" href="exo.htm#fnB834"><sup>84</sup></a><b>sn</b> (12:30)  Or so it seemed. One should not push this description to complete literalness. The reference would be limited to houses that actually had firstborn people or animals.<br>
 <a name="fn835" href="exo.htm#fnB835"><sup>85</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:31)  The urgency in Pharaoh's words is caught by the abrupt use of the imperatives--"get up, go" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WaX= WmWq</FONT> [<i>qumu ss<sup>e</sup>'u</i>]), and "go, and serve" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wdb=u!

 <a name="fn836" href="exo.htm#fnB836"><sup>86</sup></a><b>sn</b> (12:31)  It appears from this clause that Pharaoh was expecting the Israelites to go for three days to sacrifice--except that with the severe judgment on him for his refusal he would have known that this people were no longer his subjects, and he was no longer sovereign.<br>
 <a name="fn837" href="exo.htm#fnB837"><sup>87</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:32)  The form is the Piel perfect with a <i>vav</i> consecutive (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;T#k=r^b@W</FONT> [<i>u-beraktem</i>]); coming in the sequence of imperatives this perfect tense would be volitional--probably a request rather than a command.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (12:32)  Pharaoh probably meant that they should bless him also when they were sacrificing to Yahweh in their religious festival--after all, he might reason, he did let them go (after divine judgment). To bless him would mean to invoke divine blessing or good gifts on him.<br>
 <a name="fn838" href="exo.htm#fnB838"><sup>88</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:33)  The verb used here (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qzj</FONT> [<i>hazaq</i>]) is the same verb used for Pharaoh's heart being hardened. It then conveys the idea of their being resolved or insistent in this--they were not going to change.<br>
 <a name="fn839" href="exo.htm#fnB839"><sup>89</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:33)  The construction uses two infinitives construct here in a hendiadys, the first infinitive becoming the modifier.<br>

 <a name="fn845" href="exo.htm#fnB845"><sup>95</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:36)  Here the verb is the Hiphil form of the earlier Qal--<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;Wla!v=Y^w~</FONT> (<i>wayyas'ilum</i>). It is frequently translated "and they lent them"; but lending does not really fit the point here. What they gave the Israelites were farewell gifts sought by demanding or asking for them.

Kaiser records the identification of these two places as follows: The name <i>Rameses</i> probably refers to Qantir rather than Tanis, which is more remote, because Qantir was by the water. And <i>Sukkoth</i> is identified as Tell el Maskhuta in the Wadi Tumilat near modern Ismailia--or the region around the city (Kaiser, p. 379). Of the extensive bibliography, see G. W.

 <b>sn</b> (29:37)  There have been many attempts to calculate the population of the exodus group, but nothing in the text gives the exact number other than the 600,000 people on foot who were men. Estimates of two million people are very large, especially since the Bible says there were seven nations in the land of Canaan mightier than Israel. It is probably not two million people (note, the Bible never said it was--this is calculated by scholars). But attempts to reduce the number by re-defining the word "thousand" to mean clan or tribe or family unit have not been convincing, primarily because of all the tabulations of the tribes in the different books of the Bible that have to be likewise reduced. B. Jacobs rejects the many arguments and calculations as the work of eighteenth century deists and rationalists, arguing that the numbers were taken seriously in the text (p. 347). Some writers interpret the numbers as inflated due to a rhetorical use of numbers, arriving at a number of 60,000 or so for the men here listed (reducing it by a factor of ten), and insisting this is a literal interpretation of the text as opposed to a spiritual or allegorical approach (see R. Allen, "Numbers," in <i>EBC</i>, 686-96; see also G. Mendenhall, "The Census Lists of Numbers 1 and 26," <i>JBL</i> 77 <sup>60</sup>: 52-66). This proposal removes the "embarrassingly" large number for the exodus, but like other suggestions, lacks the completely compelling evidence. It is probable that the number was much lower, but lacking object and consistency we just do not know.<br>

 <a name="fn856" href="exo.htm#fnB856"><sup>106</sup></a><b>sn</b> (12:40)  Here as well biblical scholars work with the number 430 to try to reduce the stay in Egypt for the bondage. The general solutions try to argue that if the number did include the time in Canaan, that would reduce the bondage by half. Driver notes that P thought Moses was the fourth generation from Jacob (6:27), if those genealogies are strict and not selective genealogies (p. 102). But there are some other bits of information on that. The genealogy has Levi--Kohath--Amram--Moses. This would require a genealogy of 100 years, and that is unusual. But there is evidence the list is selective. In 1 Chr 2:1 the text has Bezalel (see Exod 31:2-5) a contemporary of Moses and yet the seventh from Levi. And Elishama, the leader of the Ephraim, was the ninth generation from Jacob (1 Chr 7:22-26). And Joshua, Moses' assistant, was the 11<sup>th</sup> from Jacob. So the "four generations" leading up to Moses is not necessarily complete. With regard to Exod 6, Kitchen has suggested a whole new scheme: He argues that the four names do not indicate successive generations, but tribe (Levi), clan (Kohath), family (Amram) and individual (Moses) (see K. A. Kitchen, <i>Ancient Orient and Old Testament, </i>54-55). For a detailed discussion of the length of the sojourn, see E. H. Merrill, <i>A Kingdom of Priests</i>, 74-579.<br>

The section begins at v. 43, but vv. 40-42 forms a good setting for it. In this unit vv. 43-45 belong together because they stress that a stranger and foreigner cannot eat. Verse 46 stands by itself, ruling that the meal must be eaten at home. Verses 47-49 instruct that the whole nation was to eat it. And vv. 50, 51 record the obedience of Israel. The passage does not have a great deal of difficult material in it that is new that needs to be commented on, grammatically or theologically.<br>

 <a name="fn863" href="exo.htm#fnB863"><sup>113</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:48)  Both the participle "the stranger" and the verb "will live" are from the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rWG</FONT> (<i>gur</i>), which means "to sojourn, to dwell as an alien." This reference then is to a foreigner who settles temporarily in the land. He is the protected foreigner; when he comes to another area where he does not have his clan to protect, he must come under the protection of the Law, or the people. If the "resident alien" is circumcised, he may have the passover (Driver, p. 104).<br>

 <a name="fn868" href="exo.htm#fnB868"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (13:1)  This section seems a little confusing at first glance: vv. 1 and 2 call for the dedication of the first born, and then vv. 3-10 instruct the ritual of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and then vv. 11-16 returns to the firstborn. Jacob explains that this chapter is a sermon; Moses summarizes the point, and then explains the rulings that go along with it (p. 360). So the first two verses form the basis of the chapter, calling for the redeemed (firstborn) to be sanctified to him. The second portion stresses that God requires the redeemed to remember their redemption by purifying themselves (3-10). The third section (11-16) introduces the theme of dedication to Yahweh. The point the chapter seems to be making is that in view of God's mighty redemption, the redeemed (represented by the firstborn) must be set apart to Yahweh's service.<br>

The use of this form in place of the imperative (also found in the Decalogue with the Sabbath Day instruction) stresses the basic meaning of the root word, everything involved with remembering (emphatic imperative, according to GKC &#167;113.<i>bb</i>). The verb usually implies that there will be proper action based on what was remembered.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (13:3)  There is a pattern in the arrangement of this section. There is first the command to keep the feast based on the mighty deliverance, and then the reminder of the deliverance and the command to keep the feast (9,10). "With a mighty hand" occurs in vv. 3, 9, 14, 16. Also, the explanation to the son is found in vv. 8 and 14. The emphasis "between your eyes" ends both halves, vv. 9, 10 and 16.<br>

 <a name="fn883" href="exo.htm#fnB883"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:5)  The object is the cognate accusative for emphasis on the meaning of the service--"you will serve this service."

 <a name="fn894" href="exo.htm#fnB894"><sup>27</sup></a><b>sn</b> (13:9)  This passage has, of course, been taken literally by many devout Jews, and portions of the text have been encased in <i>t<sup>e</sup>philin<sup> </sup></i>(phylacteries) and bound on the arm and forehead. Jacob, weighing the pros and cons of the literal or the figurative meaning, makes an interesting turn in the application. He says that those who took it literally should not be looked down on for their symbolic work. In many cases, he continues, it is that the spirit kills and the letter makes alive--because people who argue against a literal usage do so to excuse lack of action. This is a rather interesting twist in the discussion (p. 368). The point of the teaching was obviously meant to keep the Law of Yahweh in the mind of the people, to remind them of their duties.<br>
 <a name="fn895" href="exo.htm#fnB895"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:9)  I.e., this ceremony.<br>

 <a name="fn898" href="exo.htm#fnB898"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:9)  That these festivals and consecrations were to be signs and memorials is akin to the expressions used in the Book of Proverbs (Prov 3:3, "bind them around your neck...write them on your heart").

 <a name="fn899" href="exo.htm#fnB899"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:9)  The purpose of using this ceremony as a sign and a memorial is that the Law might be in their mouth. The imperfect tense, then, receives the classification of final imperfect in the purpose clause.<br>

The main clause is the instruction in the next verse.<br>
 <a name="fn907" href="exo.htm#fnB907"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:12)  The unusual choice of words in this passage reflects the connection with the deliverance of the first born in the exodus when the angel passed over the Israelites. Here the Law said, "you will cause to pass over (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">T*r+b^u&amp;h^w+</FONT> [<i>w<sup>e</sup>ha'abarta</i>]) to Yahweh...." The Hiphil perfect with the <i>vav</i> provides the main clause after the temporal clauses. Yahweh here claimed the firstborn as his own. The remarkable thing about this is that Yahweh did not keep the firstborn that was dedicated to him, but allowed the child to be redeemed by his father. It was an acknowledgment that the life of the child belonged to God as the one redeemed from death, and that the child represented the family. Thus, it all referred to the dedication of the redeemed to him.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (13:12)  It was once assumed by some scholars that child sacrifice lay behind this text in the earlier days, but that the priests and prophets removed those themes. Apart from the fact that there is absolutely no evidence for anything like that, the Law forbade child sacrifice, and always used child sacrifice as the sample of what not to do in conformity with the pagans (e.g., Deut 12:31). Besides, how absurd would it be for Yahweh to redeem the first born from death and then ask Israel to kill them. See further Jacobs, p. 371.<br>

The owner might not redeem the ass, but if he did not, he could not keep it, he had to kill it (so either a lamb for it, or the ass itself). But the ass could not be killed by shedding blood because that would make it a sacrifice, and that was not possible with this kind of animal. See G.

The verb is the simple Hiphil perfect <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hv*q=h!</FONT> (<i>hiqsa</i>), "he made hard"; the infinitive construct "to release us" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wnj@L=v^l=</FONT> [<i> l<sup>e</sup>sall<sup>e</sup>henu</i>]) could be taken epexegetically, meaning "he made releasing us hard." But the infinitive more likely gives the purpose or the result after the verb "hardened himself." The verb is figurative for "be stubborn" or "stubbornly refuse."<br>
 <a name="fn924" href="exo.htm#fnB924"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:15)  The text uses "man" and "beast."<br>

The etymology is uncertain, but the word denotes a sign or a mark placed on the forehead, like the frontlets which women wear (see <i>m. Shabbat</i> 6:1). The Gemara interprets it as a band that goes from ear to ear. In the Targum to 2 Sam 1:10 it is an armlet worn by Saul (see Driver, p. 110). These bands about the head may have resembled the Egyptian practice of wearing as amulets "forms of words written on folds of papyrus tightly rolled up and sewn in linen" (Kaiser, p.384).<br>
 <a name="fn927" href="exo.htm#fnB927"><sup>60</sup></a><b>sn</b> (13:16)  The pattern of the passage now emerges more clearly; it concerns the grateful debt of the redeemed. In the first part eating the unleavened bread recalls the night of deliverance in Egypt, and calls for purity. In the second part the dedication of the firstborn was an acknowledgment of the deliverance of the firstborn from bondage. They were to remember the deliverance and choose purity; they were to remember the deliverance and choose dedication. The NT will also say, "You are not your own, for you were bought with a price, therefore, glorify God...."

The emphasis here is on the leading of Yahweh--but this leading is manifested in a unique, supernatural way--unlikely to be repeated with this phenomena. Although a primary application of such a passage would be difficult, the general principle is clear: God, by his clear revelation, leads his people to the fulfillment of the promise. This section has three short parts: the leading to the sea (17, 18), the bones of Joseph (19), and the leading by the cloud and pillar (20-22).<br>

This passage illustrates what others affirm, that God leads his people in a way that is for their own good. There were shorter routes to take, but the people were not ready for them.<br>
 <a name="fn931" href="exo.htm#fnB931"><sup>64</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:17)  The word "way" is an adverbial accusative of place, "on the way"; it is in construct so that "land of the Philistines" is a genitive of either indirect object ("to the land") or location ("in" or "through" the land).<br>
 <a name="fn932" href="exo.htm#fnB932"><sup>65</sup></a><b>sn</b> (13:17)  The term <i>Philistines</i> is viewed by modern scholarship as an anachronism since the Philistines were not believed to have settled in the region until the reign of Ramses III (in which case the note would not fit either view of the exodus). But the OT clearly refers to Philistines in the days of the patriarchs. The people there in the earlier period may have been Semites, judging from their names; or they may have been migrants from Crete in the early time. The Philistines after the exodus were of Greek origin. The danger of warfare at this time was clearly with Canaanitish tribes. For further details, see K. A. Kitchen, "The Philistines," in <i>Peoples of Old Testament Times</i>, ed. D. J. Wiseman (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1973), 53-54; J. M.

 <b>sn</b> (13:18)  The translation of this title as <i>Red Sea</i> comes from the LXX. The Red Sea proper as we know it is much farther south, below the Sinai Peninsula. But the title Red Sea may very well have been extended to cover both the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba (see Deut 1:1; 1 Kgs 9:26). The name Red Sea has been replaced in many sources with "Sea of Reeds," perhaps referring to Lake Menzaleh or Lake Ballah, north of the ancient extension of the Red Sea on the western side of Sinai. The word "reeds" may be an Egyptian word for "papyrus." Whatever exact body of water is meant, it was not merely a low marshy swamp that they waded through, but a body of water large enough to make passage impossible without divine intervention, and deep enough to drown the Egyptian army. Lake Menzaleh has always been deep enough to preclude passage on foot (E. H. Merrill, <i>Kingdom of Priests</i>, p. 66). Among the many sources dealing with the geography, see B. F. Batto, "The Reed Sea: Requiscat In Pace," <i>JBL</i> 102 (1983): 27-35); M. Waxman, "I Miss the Red Sea," <i>Conservative Judaism</i> 18 (1963): 35-44; and G.

 <a name="fn942" href="exo.htm#fnB942"><sup>75</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:19)  The form is the Hiphil perfect with the <i>vav</i> consecutive; it follows in the sequence of the imperfect tense before it, and so here is equal to an imperfect of injunction (because of the solemn oath). Israel took his bones with them as a sign of piety toward the past and as a symbol of their previous bond with Canaan (Jacob, p. 380).<br>

God chose to guide the people with a pillar of cloud in the day and one of fire at night, or, as a pillar of cloud and fire since they represent his presence God has already appeared to Moses in the fire of the bush, and so here again is revelation with fire. There is some question about whether everyone could see these phenomena; but the point of the text is clear that this was a supernatural provision to lead the people. Whatever the exact nature of these things, they formed direct, visible revelations from God. God was guiding the people in a clear and unambiguous way. And both clouds and fire would again and again come to represent the presence of God in his power and majesty, guiding and protecting his people, by judging their enemies.<br>

In the argument of the book it marks the division between the bondage in Egypt and the establishment of the people as a nation. Here is the deliverance from Egypt. The chapter divides simply in two, vv. 1-14 giving the instructions, and vv. 15-31 reporting the victory. See among others, G.

 <a name="fn950" href="exo.htm#fnB950"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (14:1)  The places have been tentatively identified.

 <a name="fn952" href="exo.htm#fnB952"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (14:3)  The word translated <i>wandering around confused </i>means "perplexed, confused"; Pharaoh thought that the Israelites would not know which way to turn in order to escape--and they would never dream of crossing the sea (Driver, p. 115).<br>

So judgment will not only destroy the wicked--it will reveal the glory and majesty of the sovereignty of God. See also Exod 28:22, 29:13.<br>
 <a name="fn956" href="exo.htm#fnB956"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:4)  This is the perfect tense with the <i>vav</i> consecutive. But it announces the fulfillment of an long standing purpose--that they might know....<br>

 <a name="fn961" href="exo.htm#fnB961"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:5)  The question literally has "what is this we have done?" This is the use of the demonstrative pronoun as an enclitic, an undeclined particle stressing emphasis (Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;118).<br>
 <a name="fn962" href="exo.htm#fnB962"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:5)  <i>Heb</i> "released Israel." By metonymy the name of the nation is used collectively for the people who constitute it.<br>

 <a name="fn968" href="exo.htm#fnB968"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:7)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v!l!v*</FONT> (<i>salisim</i>) means "officers" or some special kind of military officer. At one time it was taken to mean a "three man chariot," but the pictures of Egyptian chariots only show two in a chariot. It may mean officers near the king, "men of the third rank" (Jacob, p. 394). So the chariots and the crew represented the elite. See the old view by A. E. Cowley that linked it to a Hittite word ("A Hittite Word in Hebrew," <i>JTS</i> 21 [1920]: 326), and the more recent work by P. C. Craigie connecting it to Egyptian "commander" ("An Egyptian Expression in the Song of the Sea: Exodus XV.4," <i>VT</i> 20 [1970]: 85).<br>
 <a name="fn969" href="exo.htm#fnB969"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:8)  <i>Heb</i> "with a high hand"; the expression means "defiantly; boldly" or "with confidence." The phrase is usually used for arrogant sin and pride, the defiant fist, as it were. The image of the high hand can also mean the hand raised to deliver the blow (Job 38:15). So the narrative here builds tension between these two resolute forces.<br>
 <a name="fn970" href="exo.htm#fnB970"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:10)  The disjunctive <i>vav</i> introduces a circumstantial clause here.<br>

The deictic particle calls attention to what was being seen in a dramatic way. It captures the surprise and the sudden realization of the people.<br>
 <a name="fn974" href="exo.htm#fnB974"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:10)  The verb is intensified by the adverb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">da)m=</FONT> (<i>m<sup>e</sup>'od</i>), "they feared greatly" or "were terrified." In one look their defiant boldness seems to have evaporated.<br>
 <a name="fn975" href="exo.htm#fnB975"><sup>29</sup></a><b>sn</b> (14:10)  Their cry to the LORD was proper and necessary. But their words against Moses were a rebuke and disloyal, showing a lack of faith and understanding. Their arrogance failed them in the crisis because it was built on the arm of flesh. Moses would have to get used to this murmuring, but here he takes it in stride and gives them the proper instructions. They had cried to the LORD, and now the LORD would deliver.<br>
 <a name="fn976" href="exo.htm#fnB976"><sup>30</sup></a><b>sn</b> (14:11)  Jacob notes how the speech is overly dramatic and came from a people given to using such exaggerations (Num 16:14), even using a double negative. The challenge to Moses brings a double irony. To die in the desert would be without proper burial; but in Egypt there were graves--it was a land of tombs and graves! ( 396-97). Gesenius notes that two negatives in the sentence do not nullify each other, but make the sentence all the more emphatic: "Is it because there were no graves...?" (GKC &#167;152.<i>y</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn977" href="exo.htm#fnB977"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:11)  The demonstrative pronoun has the enclitic use again, given a special emphasis to the question (Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;118).<br>

 <a name="fn980" href="exo.htm#fnB980"><sup>34</sup></a><b>sn</b> (14:12)  U. Cassuto explains this statement by the people as follows: "The question appears surprising at first, for we have not read previously that such words were spoken to Moses. Nor is the purport of the protest of the Israelite foremen (v 21) identical with that of the words uttered now. However, from a psychological standpoint the matter can be easily explained. In the hour of peril the children of Israel remember that remonstrance, and now it seems to them that it was of a sharper character and flowed from their foresight, and that the present situation justifies it, for death awaits them at this moment in the desert" (p. 164).<br>
 <a name="fn981" href="exo.htm#fnB981"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:12)  <i>Heb</i> "it is better for us to serve."<br>
 <a name="fn982" href="exo.htm#fnB982"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:13)  The use of<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> la^</FONT> (<i>`al</i>) with the jussive has the force of "stop fearing."

 <a name="fn983" href="exo.htm#fnB983"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:13)  The force of this verb in the Hitpael is "to station oneself" or "stand firm" without fleeing.<br>
 <a name="fn984" href="exo.htm#fnB984"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:13)  The form is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">War+W</FONT> (<i>u-r<sup>e</sup>'u</i>), a Qal imperative with the sequential <i>vav</i>. It could also be rendered "stand firm <i>and you will see</i>" meaning the result, or "stand firm <i>that you may see</i>" meaning the purpose.<br>
 <a name="fn985" href="exo.htm#fnB985"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:13)  Or "victory" or "deliverance."<br>

 <a name="fn987" href="exo.htm#fnB987"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:13)  The construction uses the verbal hendiadys, a Hiphil imperfect ("you will not add") and the Qal infinitive construct with a suffix ("to see them")--"you will no longer see them." Then the clause adds "again, for ever."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (14:13)  Cassuto notes that the antithetical parallelism between seeing salvation and seeing the Egyptians in this form, as well as the threefold repetition of the word "see" cannot be accidental; so too the alliteration of the last three words beginning with <i>`ayin</i> (p. 164).<br>
 <a name="fn988" href="exo.htm#fnB988"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:14)  The word order places emphasis on "the LORD" (<i>Heb</i> "Yahweh").<br>
 <a name="fn989" href="exo.htm#fnB989"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:14)  The imperfect tense needs to be interpreted in contrast to all that Yahweh will be doing. It may be given a potential imperfect nuance (as here), or it may be obligatory to follow the command to be still: "you must be still."<br>
 <a name="fn990" href="exo.htm#fnB990"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:15)  The text literally says, "speak to the Israelites that they may journey." The intent of the line, using the imperative with the subordinate jussive or imperfect expressing purpose is that the speaking is the command to move.<br>
 <a name="fn991" href="exo.htm#fnB991"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:16)  The "but you" is emphatic before the imperative "lift up." In contrast, v. 17 will begin with "but as for me, I...."<br>
 <a name="fn992" href="exo.htm#fnB992"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:16)  The imperfect (or jussive) with the <i>vav</i> is sequential coming after the series of imperatives instructing Moses to divide the sea; the form then gives the purpose (or result) of the activity--"that they may go."<br>
 <a name="fn993" href="exo.htm#fnB993"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:17)  <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn]n+h!</FONT> (<i>hin<sup>e</sup>ni</i>) before the participle carries the force of the <i>futur instans</i> participle, "Here I am hardening" meaning "I am about to harden" or "I am going to harden" their heart.<br>
 <a name="fn994" href="exo.htm#fnB994"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:17)  The form again is the imperfect tense with the <i>vav</i> to express the purpose or the result of the hardening. The repetition of the verb is interesting: Moses is to divide the sea in order that the people may cross, but God will harden the Egyptians' hearts in order that they may follow.<br>
 <a name="fn995" href="exo.htm#fnB995"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:17)  For the comments on this verb see the discussion in v. 4. God would get glory for by defeating Egypt.<br>

 <a name="fn997" href="exo.htm#fnB997"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:18)  The construction is unusual in that here only do we have "and Egypt will know." The verb is plural, and so "Egypt" must mean "the Egyptians." The verb is the perfect tense with the <i>vav</i> consecutive, showing that this recognition or acknowledgment by Egypt will be the result or purpose of the defeat of them by God.<br>
 <a name="fn998" href="exo.htm#fnB998"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:18)  The form is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yd!b=K*h!B=</FONT> (<i>b<sup>e</sup>hikkab<sup>e</sup>di</i>), the Niphal infinitive construct with a preposition and a suffix. For the suffix on a Niphal, see GKC &#167;61.<i>c</i>. The word forms a temporal clause in the line.<br>
 <a name="fn999" href="exo.htm#fnB999"><sup>53</sup></a><b>sn</b> (14:19)  Jacob makes a good case that there may have been only one pillar, one cloud; it would have been a dark cloud behind it, but in front of it, shining the way, a pillar of fire.

Childs summarizes the three possible proposals for the difficulty in the verse: (1) One takes the MT as it stands and explains it along the lines of the Targum and Jewish exegesis, that there was one cloud that was dark to one group and light to the other; (2) Another tries to reconstruct a verb form from the noun "darkness" or make some use of the Greek verb; and (3) A third seeks a different meaning for the verb "lit, gave light" (<i>y'r</i>) by comparative philology, but no consensus has been reached (p. 218). Given that there is no easy solution apart from reconstructing the text, and given that the MT can be interpreted as it is, there is not much reason to abandon it.<br>
 <a name="fn1005" href="exo.htm#fnB1005"><sup>59</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:21)  The verb is simply the Hiphil of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Elh</FONT> (<i>halak</i>), "to walk, go." The context requires that it be interpreted along the lines of "go back, go apart."<br>
 <a name="fn1006" href="exo.htm#fnB1006"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:22)  The clause literally reads, "and the waters [were] for them a wall." This is a disjunctive clause with the <i>vav</i> on the noun introducing a circumstantial clause.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (14:22)  Driver, still trying to explain things with natural explanations, suggests that a NE wind is to be thought of (an east wind would be directly in their face he says), such as a shallow ford might cooperate with an ebb tide in keeping a passage clear (p. 119). He then quotes Dillmann about the "wall" of water: "A very summary poetical and hyperbolical (xv. 8) description of the occurrence, which at most can be pictured as the drying up of a shallow ford, on both sides of which the basin of the sea was much deeper, and remained filled with water." There is no way to "water down" the text to fit natural explanations; the report clearly shows a miraculous work of God making a path through the sea--a path that had to be as wide as a half a mile in order for the many people and their animals to cross between about 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. (Kaiser, p. 389). The text does not say that they actually only started across in the morning watch, however.<br>

But its usage is always with some demonstration of mercy of wrath. Driver suggests that the look might be with fiery flashes to startle the Egyptians, throwing them into a panic. Ps 77:17-19 pictures torrents of rain with lightning and thunder (p. 120).<br>

The reading in the LXX, SP, and Syriac suggests a root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rsa</FONT> (<i>`asar</i>), "to bind." The sense here might be "clogged--presumably by their sinking in the wet sand" (Driver, p. 120).<br>

The verb means "to drive a chariot"; here in the Piel it means "cause to drive." The suffix is collective, and so the verbal form can be translated "and caused them to drive." The idea of the next word is, of course, "heavy"; it reflects the previous uses of the word for Pharaoh's heart. Here it indicates that the driving of the crippled chariots was with difficulty--a sign that the wheels had not actually come off.<br>
 <a name="fn1014" href="exo.htm#fnB1014"><sup>68</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:25)  The cohortative has the hortatory use here, "Let's flee." Although the form is singular, the sense of it is plural and so hortatory can be used. The form is singular to agree with the singular subject, "Egypt," which obviously means the Egyptian armies.<br>
 <a name="fn1015" href="exo.htm#fnB1015"><sup>69</sup></a><b>tn</b> (14:25)  The form is the Niphal participle; it is used as the predicate here, that is, the verbal use: "the LORD is fighting." This corresponds to the announcement of Moses in v. 14.<br>

Driver summarizes the research done in the Arabic cognate which was used of a stream or a river to be perennial or ever flowing. The point is that the sea here had a normal level, and now when the Egyptians were in the sea on the dry ground the water would return to that level.<br>

Others would take the Hiphil sense to be declarative, and that would indicate a considering of the object of faith trustworthy or dependable, and so therefore to be acted on. In this passage it does not mean that here they came to faith, but that they became convinced and were sure that he would save them in the future.<br>
 <a name="fn1031" href="exo.htm#fnB1031"><sup>85</sup></a><b>sn</b> (14:31)  Here the title of "servant" is given to Moses. This is the highest title a mortal can have in the OT--the "servant of Yahweh." It signifies more than a believer; it describes the individual as acting on behalf of God. For example, when Moses stretched out his hand, God used it as his own (Isa 63:12). Moses was God's personal representative. The chapter records both a message of salvation and of judgment. Like the earlier deliverance from their dwelling by the passover, this chapter can be used as a lesson on deliverance from present troubles--if God could do this for Israel, there is no trouble too great for him to overcome. The passage can also be used as a picture (at least) of the deliverance at the final judgment on the world. But the Israelites used this account for a paradigm on the power of God: namely, God is able to deliver his people from danger because he is the sovereign Lord of creation. his people must learn to trust him, even in desperate situations; they must fear him and not the situation. God can bring any threat to an end by bringing his power to bear in judgment on the wicked.<br>
 <a name="fn1032" href="exo.htm#fnB1032"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:1)  This chapter is a song of praise sung by Moses and the people right after the deliverance from the Sea. The song itself is vv. 1b-18; it falls into three sections--praise to God (1b-3), the cause for the praise (4-13), and the conclusion (14-18). The point of the first section is that God's saving acts inspire praise from his people; the second is that God's powerful acts deliver his people from the forces of evil; and the third section is that God's demonstrations of his sovereignty inspire confidence in him by his people. So the Victory Song is very much like the other declarative praise psalms--the resolve to praise, the power of God, the victory over the enemies, the incomparability of God in his redemption, and the fear of the people.

 <a name="fn1035" href="exo.htm#fnB1035"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:1)  The form is the singular cohortative, expressing the resolution of Moses to sing the song of praise ("I will" being stronger than "I shall").<br>
 <a name="fn1036" href="exo.htm#fnB1036"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:1)  This causal clause gives the reason for and summary of the praise. The Hebrew expression has <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ha*G* ha)G&#180;-yK!</FONT> (<i>ki ga'oh ga'a</i>). The basic idea of the verb is "rise up loftily" or "proudly." But derivatives of the root carry the nuance of majesty or pride (Driver, p. 132). So the idea of the perfect tense with its infinitive absolute may mean "he is highly exalted" or "he has done majestically" or "he is gloriously glorious."<br>
 <a name="fn1037" href="exo.htm#fnB1037"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:1)  The common understanding is that Egypt did not have people riding horses at this time, and so the phrase <i>the horse and its rider</i> is either viewed as an anachronism or is interpreted to mean charioteers. The word "to ride" can mean on a horse or in a chariot. Some have suggested changing "rider" to "chariot" (re-vocalization) to read "the horse and its chariot."<br>
 <a name="fn1038" href="exo.htm#fnB1038"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:2)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tr*m=z!w+</FONT> (<i>w<sup>e</sup>zimrat</i>) is problematic. It probably had a suffix <i>yod</i> that was accidentally dropped because of the <i>yod</i> on the divine name following. Most scholars posit another meaning for the word. A meaning of "power" fits the line fairly well, forming a hendiadys with strength--"strength and power" becoming "strong power." Similar lines are in Isa 12:2 and Ps 118:14. Others suggest "protection" (Freedman) or "glory" (E. M. Good). Kaiser opts for "protection" and forms a hendiadys out of that. However, there is nothing substantially wrong with "my song" in the line--only that it would be a nicer match if it had something to do with strength.<br>

 <a name="fn1086" href="exo.htm#fnB1086"><sup>55</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:21)  This song of the sea is, then, a great song of praise for Yahweh's deliverance of Israel at the Sea, and his preparation to lead them to the promised land, much to the (anticipated) dread of the nations. The principle here, and elsewhere in Scripture, is that the people of God naturally respond to God in praise for his great acts of deliverance. Few will match the powerful acts that were exhibited in Egypt, but these nonetheless set the tone. The song is certainly typological of the song of the saints in heaven who praise God for delivering them from the bondage of this world by judging the world. The focus of the praise, though, still is on the person (attributes) and works of God.<br>
 <a name="fn1087" href="exo.htm#fnB1087"><sup>56</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:22)  The first event of the Israelites' desert experience is a failure, for they murmur against Yahweh and are given a stern warning--and the provision of sweet water. The event teaches that God is able to turn bitter water into sweet water for his people, and promises to do such things if they obey. He can provide for them in the desert--he did not bring them into the desert to let them die. But there is a deeper level to this story--the healing of the water is incidental to the healing of the people, their lack of trust. The passage is arranged in a neat chiasm, starting with a journey (A), ending with the culmination of the journey (A'), developing to bitter water (B), resolving to sweet water (B'), leading to complaints by the people (C), which corresponds to the instructions for the people (C'), and the central turning point is the wonder miracle (D).<br>
 <a name="fn1088" href="exo.htm#fnB1088"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:22)  The verb form is unusual; the normal expression is with the Qal which expresses that they journeyed. But here the Hiphil is used to underscore that Moses caused them to journey--and he is following God. So the point is that God was leading Israel to the bitter water.<br>
 <a name="fn1089" href="exo.htm#fnB1089"><sup>58</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:22)  The point of the note <i>They went three days into the desert</i> is not to state how long they had been traveling, but how far they went into the desert (adverbial accusative). The statement is deliberately intended to recall Moses' demand that they go three days into the wilderness to worship. Here, three days in, they find bitter water and murmur--not worship.<br>
 <a name="fn1090" href="exo.htm#fnB1090"><sup>59</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:23)  The Hebrew word <i>Marah</i> means "bitter." This motif will be repeated four times in this passage to mark the central problem. Earlier in the book the word had been used for the "bitter herbs" in the passover, recalling the bitter labor in bondage. So there may be a double reference here--to the bitter waters and to Egypt itself--God can deliver from either.<br>
 <a name="fn1091" href="exo.htm#fnB1091"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:23)  The infinitive construct here provides the direct object for the verb "to be able," answering the question of what they were not able to do.<br>
 <a name="fn1092" href="exo.htm#fnB1092"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:23)  The causal clause here provides the reason for their being unable to drink the water, as well as a clear motivation for the name.<br>
 <a name="fn1093" href="exo.htm#fnB1093"><sup>62</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:23)  Many scholars, like Kaiser, have attempted to explain these things with natural phenomena. Here <i>Marah</i> is identified with Ain Hawarah. It is said that the waters of this well are notoriously salty and brackish; Robinson said it was six to eight feet in diameter and the water about two feet deep; the water is unpleasant, salty, and somewhat bitter. As a result the Arabs say it is the worst tasting water in the area (Kaiser, p. 398). But that would not be a sufficient amount of water for the number of Israelites in the first place; and in the second, they could not drink it at all. But third, how did Moses change it?<br>
 <a name="fn1094" href="exo.htm#fnB1094"><sup>63</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:23)  The <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/K@-lu^</FONT> (<i>`al-ken</i>) formula in the Pentateuch serves to explain to the reader the reason for the way things were. It does not necessarily mean here that Israel named the place--but they certainly could have.<br>
 <a name="fn1095" href="exo.htm#fnB1095"><sup>64</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:23)  <i>Heb</i> "one called its name," the expression can be translated as a passive verb if the subject is not expressed.<br>

It is used only in these wilderness wandering stories for the "rebellion" of the Israelites against God. They were not merely complaining--they were questioning God's abilities and motives. The action is something like a parliamentary vote of no confidence.<br>
 <a name="fn1097" href="exo.htm#fnB1097"><sup>66</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:24)  The imperfect tense here should be given a potential nuance: "What can we drink? Since the previous verse reports that they were not able to drink the water.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (15:24)  It is likely that Moses used words very much like this when he prayed. The difference seems to lie in the prepositions--he cried "to" Yahweh, but the people murmured "against" Moses.<br>

It is the Hiphil preterite from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hry</FONT> (<i>yara</i>), which has a basic meaning of "to point, show, direct." It then came to mean "to teach"; it is the verb behind the noun "Law" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hr*oT</FONT> [<i>tora</i>]).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (15:25)  Cassuto notes that here is the clue to the direction of the narrative: Israel needed God's instruction, the Law, if they were going to enjoy his provisions (p. 184).<br>
 <a name="fn1101" href="exo.htm#fnB1101"><sup>70</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:25)  Driver, of course, follows some local legends in identifying this tree as one that is supposed to have--even to this day--the properties necessary for making bitter water sweet (p. 143). Jacob reports that no such tree has ever been found; but then he adds that this does not mean there was not such a bush in the earlier days. He believes that here God used a natural means ("showed, instructed") to sweeten the water. He quotes Ben Sira as saying God had created these things with healing properties in them (p. 436).<br>

 <a name="fn1104" href="exo.htm#fnB1104"><sup>73</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:25)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WhS*n]</FONT> (<i>nissahu</i>), "and he tested him [them]" is from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hsn</FONT> (<i>nasa</i>). The use of this word in the Bible shows that there is question, doubt, or uncertainty about the object being tested.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (15:25)  The passage means that the whole episode was a test from God. He led them there through Moses, and let them go hungry and thirsty. He wanted to see how great their faith was.<br>
 <a name="fn1105" href="exo.htm#fnB1105"><sup>74</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:26)  The construction uses the infinitive absolute and the imperfect tense of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">umv</FONT> (<i>sama'</i>). The meaning of the verb is idiomatic here because it is followed by "to the voice of Yahweh your God." When this is present, the verb is translated "obey." The construction is in a causal clause. It reads, "If you will diligently obey." Gesenius points out that the infinitive absolute in a conditional clause also emphasizes the importance of the condition on which the consequence depends (GKC &#167;113.<i>o</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn1106" href="exo.htm#fnB1106"><sup>75</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:26)  The word order is reversed in the text: "and the right you do" or, "[if] you do what is right in his eyes." The conditional idea in the first clause is continued here in this clause.<br>

The word is the predicate after the pronoun: "<i>I [am] your healer</i>." The suffix will be the objective genitive--the LORD heals them.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (15:26)  The name <i>I Yahweh am your healer </i>comes as a bit of a surprise to the reader. One would expect, "I am Yahweh who heals your water"; but it was the people he came to heal, because their faith was weak. God will let Israel know here that he can control the elements of nature to bring about a spiritual response in Israel (see Deut 8).<br>
 <a name="fn1111" href="exo.htm#fnB1111"><sup>80</sup></a><b>sn</b> (15:27)  Judging from the way the story is told they were not far from the oasis. But God had other plans for them, to see if they would trust him wholeheartedly and obey. They did not do so well this first time, but this is the introduction to the wilderness, and they will have to learn how to obey. The lesson is clear: God uses adversity to test his people's loyalty. The response to adversity must be prayer to God, for he can turn the bitter into the sweet, the bad into the good, and the prospect of death into life.<br>
 <a name="fn1112" href="exo.htm#fnB1112"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (16:1)  Exod 16 plays a very important part in the development of the theme of the book. It is part of the wider section that is the prologue leading up to the covenant at Sinai, a part of which was the obligation of obedience and loyalty (P. W. Ferris, Jr., "The Manna Narrative of Exodus 16:1-10," <i>JETS</i> 18 (1975): 191-99). The record of the wanderings in the wilderness is selective and not exhaustive. It may have been arranged for propaedeutic reasons. Cassuto describes this section of the book as a didactic anthology arranged according to association of both context and language (p. 187). Its themes are: lack of vital necessities, murmuring, proving, and providing. All the wilderness stories reiterate the same motifs. So, later, when Israel arrived in Canaan, they would look back and be reminded that it was Yahweh who brought them all the way, in spite of their rebellions. Because he is their Savior and their Provider, he will demand loyalty from them. So in the Manna Narrative we have: murmuring over the lack of bread (1-3), the disputation with Moses (4-8), the appearance of the glory and the promise of bread (9-12), the provision (13-22), the instructions for the sabbath (23-30), and the memorial manna (31-36).<br>
 <a name="fn1113" href="exo.htm#fnB1113"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:1)  The sentence begins with a preterite and the <i>vav</i> consecutive, which can be subordinated to the next clause with the preterite and the <i>vav</i> consecutive. Here it has been made a temporal clause.<br>
 <a name="fn1114" href="exo.htm#fnB1114"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:1)  The word is normally rendered "congregation," but the modern perception of congregation is not exactly what is in mind in the desert.<br>

 <a name="fn1117" href="exo.htm#fnB1117"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:3)  The text reads: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wnt@Wm /T@y]-ym! </FONT>(<i>mi-yitten mutenu</i>), "who will give our death," meaning, "If only we had died." <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Wnt@Wm</FONT> is the Qal infinitive construct with the suffix. This is one way that Hebrew expresses the optative with an infinitive construct. See Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;546.<br>
 <a name="fn1118" href="exo.htm#fnB1118"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:3)  The form is the Qal infinitive construct being used in a temporal clause; and, the verb "when we ate" is the exact same structure. <br>
 <a name="fn1119" href="exo.htm#fnB1119"><sup>8</sup></a><b>sn</b> (16:3)  That the complaint leading up to the manna is unjustified can be seen from the record itself. They left Egypt with flocks and herds and very much cattle, and about 45 days later they are complaining that they are without food. Moses reminded them later that they lacked nothing (Deut 3:7; for the whole sermon on this passage, see 8:1-3). Moreover, the complaint is absurd because the food of work gangs was far more meager than they recall. The complaint was really against Moses. It is interesting that they crave the eating of meat and of bread. And so, God will meet that need; he will send bread from heaven and quail as well.<br>
 <a name="fn1120" href="exo.htm#fnB1120"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:3)  <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tym!hl=</FONT> (<i>l<sup>e</sup>hamit</i>) is the Hiphil infinitive construct showing purpose.

 <a name="fn1121" href="exo.htm#fnB1121"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:4)  The particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn]n+h!</FONT> (<i>hin<sup>e</sup>ni</i>) before the active participle indicates the imminent future action: "I am about to rain."<br>
 <a name="fn1122" href="exo.htm#fnB1122"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:4)  This verb and the next are the Qal perfect tenses with <i>vav</i> consecutives; they follow the sequence of the <i>future instans</i> participle, and so are equivalent to the imperfect tense nuances.

 <a name="fn1123" href="exo.htm#fnB1123"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:4)  The verb in the purpose/result clause is the Piel imperfect of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hsn</FONT> (<i>nasa</i>), <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">WnS#n~a&amp;</FONT> (<i>`anassenu</i>)--"in order that I may prove them [him]." The giving of the manna will be a test of their obedience to the detailed instructions of God as well as a test of their faith in him (if they believe him they will not gather too much). In chap. 17 the people will test God, showing that they do not trust him.<br>
 <a name="fn1124" href="exo.htm#fnB1124"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:4)  This is a use of an interrogative clause serving as an indirect question--to prove them "if they will walk..." (<i>Heb</i> "will they walk..."). See Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;542. <br>
 <a name="fn1125" href="exo.htm#fnB1125"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (16:4)  The word "law" here properly means "direction" at this point (Driver, p. 146); but their obedience here would indicate also whether or not they would be willing to obey when the Law was given at Sinai. <br>
 <a name="fn1126" href="exo.htm#fnB1126"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:5)  <i>Heb</i> "and it will be on the sixth day."<br>
 <a name="fn1127" href="exo.htm#fnB1127"><sup>16</sup></a><b>sn</b> (16:5)  There is a question here concerning the legislation--the people were not told why to gather twice as much on the sixth day. In other words, this instruction seems to presume that they knew about the sabbath law. That law will be included in this chapter in a number of ways, suggesting to some scholars that this chapter is out of place, placed here for a purpose. Cassuto thinks the manna episode comes after the revelation at Sinai. But it is not necessary to take such a view. God had established the sabbath in the creation; and if Moses has been expounding the Genesis traditions in his teachings then they would have known about that. <br>
 <a name="fn1128" href="exo.htm#fnB1128"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:6)  The text simply has "evening, and you will know." Gesenius notes that the perfect tense with the <i>vav</i> consecutive occurs as the apodosis to temporal clauses or their equivalents. Here the first word implies the idea "[when it becomes] evening" or simply "[in the] evening" (GKC &#167;112.<i>oo</i>).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (16:6)  Moses is very careful to make sure that they know it is Yahweh who has brought them out, and it will be Yahweh who will feed them. They are going to be convinced of this now. This is the force of his statements here.<br>
 <a name="fn1129" href="exo.htm#fnB1129"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:7)  <i>Heb</i> "morning, and you will see."<br>
 <a name="fn1130" href="exo.htm#fnB1130"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (16:7)  Kaiser says that this refers to "the sheer weight, gravity of his divine presence." He adds that the presence of Yahweh is also termed "the face of Yahweh," "the angel of Yahweh," and "the name of Yahweh" (Kaiser, p. 404). It may rather be that the power and importance and greatness of God will be revealed to Israel by the miraculous provision of manna (Driver, p. 147). <br>
 <a name="fn1131" href="exo.htm#fnB1131"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:7)  The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">oum=v*B=</FONT> (<i>b<sup>e</sup>som'o</i>) is the Qal infinitive construct with the preposition and the suffix.

 <a name="fn1132" href="exo.htm#fnB1132"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:7)  The word order places special emphasis on the pronoun: "and we--what?" The implied answer to the question is that Moses and Aaron are nothing, merely the messengers.<br>
 <a name="fn1133" href="exo.htm#fnB1133"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:8)  "You will know this" has been added to make the line smooth. Because of the abruptness of the lines in the verse, and the repetition with v. 7, Childs thinks that v. 8 is merely a repetition by scribal error--even though the versions render it as the MT has it (p.273). But Jacob suggests that the contrast with vv. 6 and 7 is important for another reason--there Moses and Aaron speak, and it is smooth and effective, but here only Moses speaks, and it is labored and clumsy. "We should realize that Moses had properly claimed to be no public speaker" (p. 447). <br>
 <a name="fn1134" href="exo.htm#fnB1134"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:8)  Here again is an infinitive construct with the preposition forming a temporal clause.<br>

 <a name="fn1137" href="exo.htm#fnB1137"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:9)  The verb means "approach, draw near." It is used in the Torah for drawing near for religious purposes to where Yahweh manifests . When the people of God draw near for service, they sense the presence of God more powerfully. It is possible that some sacrifice might have been involved here, but no mention is made of that. <br>
 <a name="fn1138" href="exo.htm#fnB1138"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:10)  <i>Heb</i> "and it was as Aaron spoke," the construction uses the temporal indicator and then the Piel<i> </i>infinitive construct followed by the subjective genitive "Aaron."<br>

 <a name="fn1141" href="exo.htm#fnB1141"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:10)  The verb is the Niphal perfect of the verb "to see"--"it was seen." But the standard way of translating this form is from the perspective of Yahweh as subject-- "he appeared."<br>

 <a name="fn1143" href="exo.htm#fnB1143"><sup>32</sup></a><b>sn</b> (16:12)  One of the major interpretive difficulties is the comparison between Exod 16 and Num 11. In Numbers we find that the giving of the manna was about 24 months after the Exod 16 time (assuming there was a distinct time for this chapter), that it was after the erection of the tabernacle, that <i>Taberah</i> (the Burning) preceded it (not in Exod 16), that the people were tired of the manna (not that there was no bread to eat) and so God would send the quail, and that the provision of the manna is not presented as being short-termed or seasonal. The account in the Book of Numbers also indicates that the quail came later, and that there was a severe tragedy over it. In Exod 16 both the manna and the quail are given on the 15th day of the second month. Contemporary scholarship generally assigns them to two different sources, because complete reconciliation seems impossible. Even if we argue that Exodus has a thematic arrangement and "telescopes" some things to make a point, there will still be difficulties in harmonization. Two considerations must be kept in mind: 1) First, they could be separate events entirely. If this is true, then they should be treated separately as valid accounts of things that appeared or occurred throughout the period of the wanderings. Similar things need not be the same thing. 2) Secondly, strict chronological order is not always maintained in the Bible narratives, especially if it is a didactic section. Perhaps Exod 16 describes the initiation of the giving of manna as God's provision of bread, and therefore placed in the prologue of the covenant, and Num 11 is an account of a mood which developed over a period of time in response to the manna. Num 11 would then be looking back from a different perspective. <br>
 <a name="fn1144" href="exo.htm#fnB1144"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (16:12)  The verb means "to be sated, satisfied"; in this context it indicates that they would have sufficient bread to eat--they would be full.<br>

 <a name="fn1150" href="exo.htm#fnB1150"><sup>39</sup></a><b>sn</b> (16:14)  The translations usually refer to the manna as "bread." In actual fact it appears to be more like grains, because it could be ground in the hand-mills and made into cakes. The word involved says it is thin, flake-like (if we accept an Arabic etymological connection). There does not seem to be much warrant for saying it was round. What we know about it from the Bible in Exodus is that it was a very small flake-like substance, it would melt when the sun got hot, if left over it bred worms and became foul, it could be ground, baked and boiled, it was abundant enough for them to gather an omer a day per person, and the gathered it day by day throughout the wilderness sojourn. Num 11 says it was like coriander seed with the appearance of bdellium, it tasted like fresh oil, and it fell with the dew. Deut 8:3 says it was unknown to Israel or her ancestors; Psalm 78:24 parallels it with grain. Biblical scholars compare it to other ancient references of honeydew that came from the heavens (see T. H. Gaster, <i>Myth, Legend, and Custom in the Old Testament</i> [NY:Harper and Row, 1969], p. 243); Hesiod, <i>Theogany</i>, 581; and Aristotle, <i>Historia animalium</i> 22,4). Others try to find some natural cause for the "miracle": F. S. Bodenheimer says that it was a sudden surprise for the nomadic Israelites because it provided what they desired--sweetness. He says that it was a product that came from two insects, making the manna a honeydew excretion from plant lice and scale insects. The excretion hardens and drops to the ground as a sticky solid. He notes that some cicadas are called <i>man</i> in Arabic ("The Manna of Sinai," <i>BA</i> 10 [1947]:2). This view accounts for some of the things in these passages: the right place, the right time, the right description, and a similar taste. But there are major difficulties: Exodus requires a far greater amount, it could breed worms, it could melt away, it could be baked into bread, it could decay and stink. The suggestion is in no way convincing. Bodenheimer argues that "worms" could mean "ants" that carried them away, but that is contrived--the text could have said ants. The fact that the Bible calls it "bread" creates no problem. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;j#l#</FONT> (<i>lehem</i>) is used in a wide range of meanings from bread to all kinds of food including goats (Judg 13:15,16) and honey (1 Sam 14:24-28). Scripture does not say that manna was the only thing that they ate for the duration. But they did eat it throughout the forty years. It simply must refer to some supernatural provision for them in their diet. Modern suggestions may invite comparison and analysis, but they do not satisfy or explain the text. <br>

From this statement the name "manna" was given to the substance. <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/m*</FONT> (<i>man</i>) for "what" is not found in Hebrew as far as we know, but appears in later Syriac as a contraction of <i>ma den</i>, "what then?" In Aramaic and Arabic <i>man</i> is "what?" The word is used here apparently for the sake of etymology. Childs follows the approach that any connections to words that actually meant "what?" are unnecessary, for it is a play on the name (whatever it may have been) and therefore related only by sound to the term being explained (p. 274). This, however, presumes that a substance was known prior to this account--a point that Deuteronomy does not seem to allow. Driver says that we do not know how early the Aramaic contraction came into use, but that this verse seems to reflect it (p. 149). Probably we must simply accept, as Cassuto says, that in the early Israelite period <i>man</i> meant "what?" There seems to be sufficient evidence to support this: see the reference in the KBL lexicon for Amarna (EA 286,5), Cyrus Gordon's <i>Ugaritic Textbook</i> (p. 435) for the use in Ugaritic, and the Jean-Hoftijzer dictionary of western Semitic languages for early Aramaic (p. 157).<br>

 <a name="fn1197" href="exo.htm#fnB1197"><sup>86</sup></a><b>sn</b> (16:36)  The point of this chapter, with all its instructions and reports included, is God's miraculous provision of food for his people. This is a display of sovereign power that differs from the display of military power. But once again the story calls for faith, but here it is faith in Yahweh to provide for his people. The provision is also a test to see if they will obey the instructions of God. Deut 8 explains this. The point, then, is that God provides for the needs of his people that they might demonstrate their dependence on him by obeying his word. The exposition of this passage must also correlate to John 6. God's providing Manna from heaven to meet the needs of his people takes on new significance in the application that Jesus makes of the subject to himself. There the requirement is the same--will they believe and obey? But at the end of the event John tells us they murmured about Jesus. <br>
 <a name="fn1198" href="exo.htm#fnB1198"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (17:1)  This is the famous story telling how the people rebelled against Yahweh when they thirsted, saying that Moses had brought them out into the wilderness to kill them by thirst, and how Moses with the rod brought water from the rock. As a result of this the name was called Massa and Meribah because of the testing and the striving. It was a challenge to Moses' leadership as well as a test of Yahweh's presence. The narrative in its present form serves an important point in the argument of the book. The story turns on the gracious provision of God who can give his people water when there is none available. The narrative is structured to show how the people strove. Thus, the story intertwines God's free flowing grace with the sad memory of Israel's sins. The passage can be divided into three parts: the situation and the complaint (1-3), the cry and the miracle (4-6), and the commemoration by naming (7).<br>
 <a name="fn1199" href="exo.htm#fnB1199"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:1)  "congregation."<br>
 <a name="fn1200" href="exo.htm#fnB1200"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:1)  The text says that they journeyed "according to their journeyings." Since the verb form (and therefore the derived noun) essentially means to pull up the tent pegs and move along, this verse would be saying that they traveled by stages, or, from place to place. <br>
 <a name="fn1201" href="exo.htm#fnB1201"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (17:1)  The location is a bit of a problem. Exod 19:1-2 suggests that it is near Sinai, whereas it is normally located near Kadesh in the north. Martin Noth simply concludes that two versions came together without any details provided (<i>Exodus,</i> p. 138). Driver simply says that the writer wrote not knowing that they were 24 miles apart (p. 157). This passage is located near Horeb, or Sinai. Critics have long been bothered by this passage because of the two names given at the same place. Childs notes, however, that if two sources had been brought together, it is not possible now to identify them. But Noth insisted that if there were two names there were two different locations. The names Massa and Meribah occur alone in Scripture (Deut 9:22, and Num 20:1 for examples), but together in Ps 95 and in Deut 33:8. But none of these passages is a clarification of the difficulty. Most critics would argue that Massa was a secondary element that was introduced into this account, because Exod 17 focuses on Meribah. From that starting point they can diverge greatly on the interpretation, usually having something to do with a water test. But although Num 20 is parallel in several ways, there are major differences: 1) it takes place 40 years later than this, 2) the name Kadesh is joined to the name Meribah there; and 3) Moses is punished there. One must conclude that if an event could occur twice in similar ways (complaint about water would be a good candidate for such), then there is no reason a similar name could not be given. <br>
 <a name="fn1202" href="exo.htm#fnB1202"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:1)  The disjunctive <i>vav </i>introduces a parenthetical clause that is essential for this passage--there was no water.<br>
 <a name="fn1203" href="exo.htm#fnB1203"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:1)  Here the construction uses a genitive after the infinitive construct for the subject: "there was no water for the drinking of the people--for the people to drink" (GKC &#167;115.<i>c</i>). <br>
 <a name="fn1204" href="exo.htm#fnB1204"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:2)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">br#Y*w~</FONT> (<i>wayyareb</i>) is from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">byr!</FONT> (<i>rib</i>); it forms the basis of the name "Meribah." The word means "strive, quarrel, be in contention" and even "litigation." A translation "quarrel" does not appear to capture the magnitude of what is being done here. The people have a legal dispute--they are contending with Moses as if bringing a lawsuit. <br>
 <a name="fn1205" href="exo.htm#fnB1205"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:2)  The imperfect tense with the <i>vav</i> follows the imperative, and so it carries the nuance of the logical sequence, showing purpose or result. This may be expressed in English as "give us water so that we may drink," but more simply with the English infinitive, "give us water to drink."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (17:2)  One wonders if the people thought that Moses and Aaron had water and were withholding it from the people, or whether Moses was able to get it on demand. The people should have come to Moses to ask him to pray to God for water. But their action led Moses to say that they had challenged God (Jacob, p. 476). <br>
 <a name="fn1206" href="exo.htm#fnB1206"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:2)  In this case and in the next clause the imperfect tenses are to be taken as progressive imperfects--the action is in progress. <br>
 <a name="fn1207" href="exo.htm#fnB1207"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:2)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hsn</FONT> (<i>nasa</i>) means "to test, tempt, try, prove." It can be used of people simply trying to do something that they are not sure of (such as David trying on Saul's armor), or of God testing people to see if they will obey (as in testing Abraham, Gen 22:1), or of people challenging others (as in the Queen of Sheba coming to test, i.e., "stump," Solomon), and of the people in the desert in rebellion putting God to the test. By doubting that God was truly in their midst, and demanding that he demonstrate his presence, they tested him to see if he would act. There are times when "proving" God is correct and required, but that is done by faith (as with Gideon); but when it is done out of unbelief, then it is an act of disloyalty. <br>
 <a name="fn1208" href="exo.htm#fnB1208"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:3)  The verbs and the pronouns in this verse are in the singular because "the people" is singular in form.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (17:6)  The reader has many questions when studying this passage--why water from a rock, why Horeb, why strike the rock when later only speak to it, why recall the Nile miracles, etc. Jacob says that all these are answered when we realize that they were putting God to the test. So water from the rock, the most impossible thing, cleared up the question of his power. Doing it at Horeb was significant because there Moses was called and told he would bring them to this place. Since they had doubted God was in their midst, he would not do this miracle in the camp, but have Moses lead the elders out to Horeb. If people doubt God is in their midst, then he will choose not to be in their midst. And striking the rock recalled striking the Nile; there it brought death to Egypt, but here it brought life to Israel. There could be little further doubting that God was with them and able to provide for them. See Jacob, 479-480. <br>
 <a name="fn1216" href="exo.htm#fnB1216"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:6)  Or "by."<br>
 <a name="fn1217" href="exo.htm#fnB1217"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:6)  The form is the Hiphil<i> </i>perfect with the <i>vav</i> consecutive; it follows the future nuance of the participle, and so is equivalent to an imperfect tense nuance of instruction.<br>
 <a name="fn1218" href="exo.htm#fnB1218"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:6)  These two verbs are also perfect tenses with <i>vav</i> consecutive: "and [water] will go out...and [the people] will drink." But the second verb is clearly the intent or the result of the water gushing from the rock, and so it may be subordinated.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (17:6)  The presence of Yahweh at this rock enabled Paul to develop a midrashic lesson, an analogical application: Christ was present with Israel to provide water for them in the wilderness. So this was a Christophany. But Paul takes it a step further to equate the rock with Christ, for just as it was struck to produce water, so Christ would be struck to produce rivers of living water. The provision of bread to eat and water to drink provided for Paul a ready analogy with the provisions of Christ in the gospel (1 Cor 10:4). <br>
 <a name="fn1219" href="exo.htm#fnB1219"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:6)  <i>Heb</i> "in the eyes of."<br>
 <a name="fn1220" href="exo.htm#fnB1220"><sup>23</sup></a><b>sn</b> (17:7)  The name Massa (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hS*m^</FONT> [<i>massa</i>]) means "Proving"; it is derived from the verb "test, prove, try." And the name Meribah (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb*yr!m=</FONT> [<i>m<sup>e</sup>riba</i>]) means "Strife"; it is related to the verb "to strive, quarrel, contend." The choice of these names for the place would serve to remind Israel for all time of this failure with God. God wanted this and all subsequent generations to know how unbelief challenges God. And yet, he gave them water. So in spite of their failure, he remained faithful to his promises. The incident became proverbial, for it is the warning in Ps 95:7-8, which is quoted in Heb 3:15: "Oh<b>,</b> that today you would listen as he speaks!<b><i> </i></b>Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion<b>,</b> in the day of testing in the wilderness<b>. </b>There your fathers tested me and tried me<b>,</b> and they saw my works for forty years<b>." </b>The lesson is clear enough: to persist in this kind of unbelief could only result in the loss of divine blessing. Or, to put it another way, if they refused to believe in the power of God, they would wander powerless in the wilderness. They had every reason to believe, but they did not. (Note that this does not mean they are unbelievers, only that they would not take God at his word.)<br>
 <a name="fn1221" href="exo.htm#fnB1221"><sup>24</sup></a><b>sn</b> (17:8)  In this short passage we have the first account of Israel's holy wars. The war effort and Moses' holding up his hands go side by side until the victory is won and commemorated. Many have used this as an example of intercessory prayer--but the passage makes no such mention. In Exodus so far the rod of God is the token of the power of God; when Moses used it, God demonstrated his power. To use the rod of God was to say that God did it; to fight without the rod was to face defeat. Using the rod of God was a way of submitting to and depending on the power of God in all areas of life. The first part of the story reports the attack and the preparation for the battle (8,9). The second part describes the battle and its outcome (10-13). The final section is the preservation of this event in the memory of Israel (14-16). <br>
 <a name="fn1222" href="exo.htm#fnB1222"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:8)  <i>Heb</i> "and Amalek came." <br>
 <a name="fn1223" href="exo.htm#fnB1223"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:8)  Or "fought with."<br>
 <a name="fn1224" href="exo.htm#fnB1224"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:9)  This could be rendered literally "choose men for us." But the <i>lamed</i> preposition probably indicates possession, "our men," and the fact that Joshua was to choose from Israel, as well as the fact that there is no article on "men," indicates he was to select some to fight.<br>
 <a name="fn1225" href="exo.htm#fnB1225"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:10)  The line in Hebrew reads literally: And Joshua did as Moses had said to him, to fight with Amalek. The infinitive construct is epexegetical, explaining what Joshua did that was in compliance with Moses' words.<br>
 <a name="fn1226" href="exo.htm#fnB1226"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:11)  The two verbs in the temporal clauses are governed by <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rv#a&amp;K^ hy&#180;h*w+</FONT> (<i>w<sup>e</sup>haya ka'aser</i>)<i>-- "</i>as long as<i>" </i>or, "and it was that whenever." This indicates that the two imperfect tenses should be given a frequentative translation, probably a customary imperfect.<i> </i><br>
 <a name="fn1227" href="exo.htm#fnB1227"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:11)  Or "lower"<br>
 <a name="fn1228" href="exo.htm#fnB1228"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:12)  Literally "now the hands of Moses," the disjunctive <i>vav</i> introduces a circumstantial clause here--of time.<br>
 <a name="fn1229" href="exo.htm#fnB1229"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:12)  The term used here is the adjective <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yd!b@K= </FONT>(<i>k<sup>e</sup>bedim</i>). It means "heavy," but in this context the idea is more that of being tired. This is the important word that was used in the plague stories: when the heart of Pharaoh was hard, then the Israelites did not gain their freedom or victory. Likewise here, when the rod was lowered because Moses' hands were "heavy," Israel started to lose.<br>
 <a name="fn1230" href="exo.htm#fnB1230"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:12)  <i>Heb</i> "from this, one, and from this, one."<br>
 <a name="fn1231" href="exo.htm#fnB1231"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:12)  The word "steady" is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hn*Wma$</FONT> (<i>`emuna</i>), from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/ma</FONT> (<i>`aman</i>). The word usually means "faithfulness." Here we have a good illustration of the basic idea of the word--firm, steady, reliable, dependable. There may be a <i>double entendre</i> here; on the one hand it simply says that his hands were stayed so that Israel might win, but on the other hand it is portraying Moses as steady, firm, reliable, faithful. The point is that whatever God commissioned as the means of agency of power--to Moses a rod, to the Christians the Spirit--the people of God had know that the victory came from God alone. <br>
 <a name="fn1232" href="exo.htm#fnB1232"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:13)  The verb means "disabled, weakened, prostrated." The verb is used a couple of times in the Bible to describe how man dies and is powerless (see Josh. 14:10; Isaiah 14:12).<br>
 <a name="fn1233" href="exo.htm#fnB1233"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:13)  Or "people."<br>
 <a name="fn1234" href="exo.htm#fnB1234"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:13)  <i>Heb</i> "mouth of the sword." It means as the sword devours--without quarter (Driver, p. 159).<br>
 <a name="fn1235" href="exo.htm#fnB1235"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:14)  The presence of the article does not mean that he was to write this in a book that was existing now, but in one dedicated to this purpose (book, meaning scroll). See GKC &#167;126.<i>s</i>.<br>
 <a name="fn1236" href="exo.htm#fnB1236"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:14)  The Hebrew word is "place," meaning that the events were to be impressed on the heart of Joshua. The word "rehearse" means to go over and over something, and that may not be the intent of this verb, although the point of writing the events in the book would add that goal.<br>
 <a name="fn1237" href="exo.htm#fnB1237"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:14)  <i>Heb</i> "in the ears of Joshua."<br>
 <a name="fn1238" href="exo.htm#fnB1238"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:14)  The construction uses the infinitive absolute and the imperfect tense to stress the resolution of Yahweh to destroy Amalek. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hjm</FONT> (<i>maha</i>) is often translated "blot out"--but that is not a very satisfactory image, since it would not remove completely what is the object. "Efface, erase, scrape off" (as in a palimpsest, a manuscript which is scraped clean so it can be reused) is a more accurate image.<br>
 <a name="fn1239" href="exo.htm#fnB1239"><sup>42</sup></a><b>sn</b> (17:14)  This would seem to be defeated by the preceding statement that the events would be written in a book for a memorial. If this war is recorded, then the Amalekites would be remembered. But here God was going to wipe out the memory of them. But the idea of removing the memory of a people is an idiom for destroying them--they will have no posterity and no lasting heritage. <br>
 <a name="fn1240" href="exo.htm#fnB1240"><sup>43</sup></a><b>sn</b> (17:15)  <i>Heb</i> "Yahweh-nissi," which means "Yahweh is my banner." Note that when Israel murmured and failed God, the name commemorated the incident or the outcome of their failure. When they were blessed with success, the naming praised God. Here the holding up of the rod of God was preserved in the name for the altar--God gave them the victory. <br>
 <a name="fn1241" href="exo.htm#fnB1241"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (17:16)  The line here is very difficult. The Hebrew text has <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Hy&#180; sK@-lu^ dy&#180;-yK!</FONT> (<i>ki yad `al kes Yah</i>), "for a hand to the throne of Yah." If the word is "throne" (and it is not usually spelled like this), then it would mean Moses' hand was extended to the throne of God, showing either intercession or source of power. It could not be turned to mean that the hand of Yah was taking an oath to destroy the Amalekites. The LXX took the same letters, but apparently saw the last four as a verbal form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hysk</FONT>; it reads "with a secret hand." Most scholars have simply assumed that the text is wrong, and the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">sK@</FONT> should be emended to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">sn@</FONT> to fit the name, for this is the pattern of naming in the OT with popular etymologies--some motif of the name must be found in the sentiment. This would then read, "My hand on the banner of Yah." It would be an expression signifying that the banner, the rod of God, should ever be ready at hand as the Israelites fight the Amalekites again and again.<br>
 <a name="fn1242" href="exo.htm#fnB1242"><sup>45</sup></a><b>sn</b> (17:16)  The message of this short narrative, then, concerns the power of God to protect his people. We have the difficulty, the victory, and the commemoration. The victory must be retained in memory by the commemoration. So the idea could focus on that: The people of God must recognize (both for engaging in warfare and for praise afterwards) that victory comes only with the power of God. In the NT the issue is even more urgent, because the warfare is spiritual--we do not wrestle against flesh and blood. So only God's power will bring victory.<br>
 <a name="fn1243" href="exo.htm#fnB1243"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:1)  This chapter forms the transition to the Law. There has been the deliverance, the testing passages, the provision in the wilderness, and the warfare. Any God who can do all this for his people deserves their allegiance. In chap. 18 the Lawgiver is giving advice, using laws and rulings; but then he is given advice to organize the elders to assist. Thus, when the Law is fully revealed, a system will be in place to administer it. The point of the passage is that a great leader humbly accepts advice from other godly believers to delegate responsibility. He does not try to do it all himself; God does not want one individual to do it all. The chapter has three parts: vv. 1-12 tell how Jethro heard and came and worshipped and blessed; then vv. 13-23 have the advice of Jethro, and then vv. 24-27 tell how Moses implemented the plan and Jethro went home (rather than stay and try to run it!). See further E. J. Runions, "Exodus Motifs in 1 Samuel 7 and 8," <i>EvQ</i> 52 (1980): 130-31; and also see for another idea T. C. Butler, "An Anti-Moses Tradition," <i>JSOT</i> 12 (1979): 9-15.<br>
 <a name="fn1244" href="exo.htm#fnB1244"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:1)  <i>Heb</i> "and he heard."<br>
 <a name="fn1245" href="exo.htm#fnB1245"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:1)  This clause beginning with <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK </FONT>(<i>ki</i>) answers the question of what Jethro had heard; it provides a second, explanatory noun clause that is the object of the verb-- "he heard (1) all that God had done... (2) that he had brought...." See Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;490.<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">!</FONT><br>
 <a name="fn1246" href="exo.htm#fnB1246"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:1)  This is an interesting report that Jethro has heard, for the claim of God that he brought Israel out of bondage in Egypt will be the foundation of the covenant stipulations (Exod 20). <br>
 <a name="fn1247" href="exo.htm#fnB1247"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:3)  <i>Heb</i> "he"; the referent (Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity (also in the following verse).<br>
 <a name="fn1248" href="exo.htm#fnB1248"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:4)  Here now we get the etymological explanation of the name of Moses' other son, Eliezer (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rz#u#yl!a$</FONT> [<i>`eli'ezer</i>]), which means "my God is a help." The sentiment that explains this name is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yr!z+u#B= yb!a* yh@la$</FONT> (<i>`elohe `abi b<sup>e</sup>'ezri</i>), "the God of my father is my help." The preposition in the sentiment is the <i>bet essentiae</i> (giving the essence--see GKC &#167;119.<i>i</i>). The word for "help" is a common word in the Bible, first introduced as a description of the woman in the Garden. It means to do for someone what he or she cannot do for himself or herself. Samuel raised the "stone of help" (Ebenezer) when Yahweh "helped them" win the battle (1 Sam 7:12).<br>
 <a name="fn1249" href="exo.htm#fnB1249"><sup>7</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:4)  The verb "delivered" is an important motif in this chapter (see its use in vv. 8, 9, and 10 with reference to Pharaoh). <br>
 <a name="fn1250" href="exo.htm#fnB1250"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:5)  This is an adverbial accusative that defines the place (see GKC &#167;118.<i>g</i>). <br>
 <a name="fn1251" href="exo.htm#fnB1251"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:5)  The mountain of God is Horeb, and so the desert here must be the Sinai desert by it. But chap. 19 suggests that they left Rephidim to go the 24 miles to Sinai. It may be that this chapter fits in chronologically after the move to Sinai, but was placed here thematically. Kaiser defends the present location of the story by responding to other reasons for the change given by Lightfoot, but does not deal with the travel locations (see p. 411). <br>
 <a name="fn1252" href="exo.htm#fnB1252"><sup>10</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:6)  It seems that this verse is out of place, since the report has already been given that they came to the desert.

 <a name="fn1253" href="exo.htm#fnB1253"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:6)  The LXX solves the problem by taking the pronoun "I" as the particle "behold" and reads it this way: "one said to Moses, `Behold, your father-in-law has come...."<br>
 <a name="fn1254" href="exo.htm#fnB1254"><sup>12</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:7)  This is more than polite oriental custom. Jethro was Moses' benefactor, father-in-law, and a priest. He paid much respect to him. Now he could invite Jethro into <i>his</i> home (see Jacob, p. 496). <br>

 <a name="fn1260" href="exo.htm#fnB1260"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:9)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hdj</FONT> (<i>hada</i>) is rare, occurring only in Job 3:6 and Ps 21:6, although it is common in Aramaic. The LXX translated it "he shuddered." U. Cassuto suggests that that rendering was based on the midrashic interpretation in <i>b. Sanhedrin 94b</i>, "he felt cuts in his body"--a word play on the verb (pp. 215-16).<br>
 <a name="fn1261" href="exo.htm#fnB1261"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:10)  This is a common form of praise. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">EwrB*</FONT> (<i>baruk</i>) is the Qal passive participle of the verb. Here must be supplied a jussive, making this participle the predicate: "May Yahweh be blessed." The verb essentially means "to enrich"; in praise it would mean that he would be enriched by the praises of the people.<br>
 <a name="fn1262" href="exo.htm#fnB1262"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:11)  The end of this sentence seems not to have been finished, or it is very elliptical. Here "he has destroyed them" is added. Others take the last prepositional phrase to be the completion and supply only a verb: "[he was] above them." Cassuto takes the word "gods" to be the subject of the verb "act proudly," giving the sense of "precisely (<i>ki</i>) in respect of these things of which the gods of Egypt boasted--He is greater than they (<i>`alehem</i>)." He suggests rendering the clause, "excelling them in the very things to which they laid claim" (p. 216). <br>
 <a name="fn1263" href="exo.htm#fnB1263"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:12)  The verb is actually "and he took." It must have the sense of getting the animals for the sacrifice. The Syriac, Targum and Vulgate have "offered." But Cody argues because of the precise wording in the text Jethro did not offer the sacrifices but received them (A. Cody, "Exodus 18,12: Jethro Accepts a Covenant With the Israelites," <i>Bib</i> 49 (1968): 159-61).<br>
 <a name="fn1264" href="exo.htm#fnB1264"><sup>22</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:12)  Jethro brought offerings as if he were the one who had been delivered. The "burnt offering" is singular, to honor God first. And then the other sacrifices were intended for the invited guests to eat (a forerunner of the peace offering). See Jacob, p. 498.<br>
 <a name="fn1265" href="exo.htm#fnB1265"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:12)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;j#l#</FONT> (<i>lehem</i>) here means the sacrifice and all the foods that were offered with it. The eating before God was part of the covenantal ritual, for it signified that they were in communion with the Deity, and with one another.<br>
 <a name="fn1266" href="exo.htm#fnB1266"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:13)  <i>Heb</i> "and it was/happened on the morrow." <br>
 <a name="fn1267" href="exo.htm#fnB1267"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:13)  This is a simple summary of the function of Moses on this particular day. He did not do this every day, but it was time now to do it. The people would come to solve their difficulties, or to hear instruction from Moses on decisions to be made. The tradition of sitting in Moses seat is drawn from this passage. <br>
 <a name="fn1268" href="exo.htm#fnB1268"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:14)  <i>Heb</i> "what is this thing."<br>
 <a name="fn1269" href="exo.htm#fnB1269"><sup>27</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:14)  This question, "what are you doing for the people," is qualified by the next two questions. By sitting alone all day and the people standing around all day showed that Moses was exhibiting too much care for the people--he could not do this. <br>
 <a name="fn1270" href="exo.htm#fnB1270"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:15)  The form is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vrd+l! </FONT>(<i>lidros</i>), the Qal<i> </i>infinitive construct giving the purpose. To inquire of God would be to seek God's will on a matter, to obtain a legal decision on a matter, or to settle a dispute. As a judge Moses is speaking for God; but as the servant of Yahweh Moses' words will be God's words. The psalms would later describe judges as "gods" because they made the right decisions based on God's Law.<br>
 <a name="fn1271" href="exo.htm#fnB1271"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:16)  Or "dispute."<br>
 <a name="fn1272" href="exo.htm#fnB1272"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:16)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Fpv</FONT> (<i>sapat</i>) means "to judge"; more specifically, it means to make a decision as an arbiter or umpire. When people brought issues to him, he decided between them. In the section of Law in Exodus after the Ten Commandments we have the <i>Mishp<sup>e</sup>tim</i>, the decisions. <br>
 <a name="fn1273" href="exo.htm#fnB1273"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:16)  The "decrees" or "statutes" were definite rules, stereotyped and permanent; the "laws" were directives or pronouncements given when situations arose. Driver suggests this is another reason why this event might have taken place after Yahweh had given laws on the mountain (p. 165).<br>
 <a name="fn1274" href="exo.htm#fnB1274"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:18)  The verb means "to fall and fade" as a leaf (Ps 1:3). In Ps 18:45 it is used figuratively of foes fading away, failing in strength and courage (Driver, p. 166). Here the infinitive absolute construction heightens the meaning.<br>
 <a name="fn1275" href="exo.htm#fnB1275"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:18)  Gesenius lists the specialized use of the comparative <i>min</i> where with an adjective the thought expressed is that the quality is too difficult for the attainment of a particular aim (GKC &#167;133.<i>c</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn1276" href="exo.htm#fnB1276"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:19)  <i>Heb</i> "hear my voice."<br>
 <a name="fn1277" href="exo.htm#fnB1277"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:19)  The line reads "Be you to the people before God." He is to be their representative before God. This is introducing the aspect of the work that only Moses could do, what he has been doing. He is to be before God for the people, to pray for them, to appeal on their behalf. Jethro is essentially saying, I understand that you cannot delegate this to anyone else, so continue doing it (U. Cassuto, pp. 219-20).<br>
 <a name="fn1278" href="exo.htm#fnB1278"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:19)  The form is the perfect tense with the <i>vav </i>consecutive; following the imperative it will be instruction as well. Since the imperative preceding this had the idea of "continue to be" as you are, this too has that force.<br>
 <a name="fn1279" href="exo.htm#fnB1279"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:19)  <i>Heb</i> "words."<br>
 <a name="fn1280" href="exo.htm#fnB1280"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:20)  The perfect tense with the <i>vav</i> continues the sequence of instruction for Moses. He alone was to be the mediator, to guide them in the religious and moral instruction.<br>
 <a name="fn1281" href="exo.htm#fnB1281"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:20)  The verb and its following prepositional phrase form a relative clause, modifying "the way." The imperfect tense should be given the nuance of obligatory imperfect--it is the way they must walk. <br>
 <a name="fn1282" href="exo.htm#fnB1282"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:20)  This last part is parallel to the preceding: "work" is also a direct object of the verb "make known," and the relative clause that qualifies it also uses an obligatory imperfect.<br>
 <a name="fn1283" href="exo.htm#fnB1283"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:21)  The construction uses the independent pronoun for emphasis, and then the imperfect tense "see" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hzj</FONT> [<i>haza</i>])-- "and <i>you</i> will see from all...." Both in Hebrew and Ugaritic expressions of "seeing" are used in the sense of choosing (Gen 41:33). See U. Cassuto, p. 220.<br>

The word "truth" includes the ideas of faithfulness or reliability, as well as truth itself. It could be understood to mean "truthful men," men whose word is reliable and true.<br>

The language of "captains of thousands" etc., is used more for military ranks. There must have been more detailed instruction involved here, for each Israelite would have come under four leaders with this arrangement, and perhaps difficult cases would be sent to the next level. But since the task of these men would also be for instruction and guidance, the breakdown would be very useful. Deut 1:9, 13 suggest that the choice of these people was not simply Moses' alone. <br>

 <a name="fn1307" href="exo.htm#fnB1307"><sup>65</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:27)  This chapter makes an excellent message on spiritual leadership of the people of God. Spiritually responsible people are to be selected to help in the work of the ministry (teaching, deciding cases, meeting needs), so that there will be peace, and so that leaders will not be exhausted. Probably capable people are more ready to do that than leaders are ready to relinquish control. But leaders have to be willing to take the risk, to entrust the task to others. Here Moses is the model of humility, receiving correction and counsel from Jethro. And Jethro is the ideal advisor, for he has no intention of remaining there to run the operation. <br>
 <a name="fn1308" href="exo.htm#fnB1308"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (19:1)  This chapter is essentially about mediation. The people are getting ready to meet with God and receive the Law from him and enter into covenant with him. But all of this required mediation and preparation. But through it all, Israel will become God's unique possession, a kingdom of priests on earth--if they comply with his Law. The chapter can be divided as follows: vv. 1-8 tell how God revealed as the great deliverer of Israel and promised to make them a kingdom of priests; this is followed by God's declaration that Moses would be the mediator (v. 9); then, vv. 19-22 record the instructions for Israel to prepare themselves to worship Yahweh, including an account of the manifestation of Yahweh with all the phenomena (16-22); and finally, closes with the mediation of Moses on behalf of the people (vv. 24, 25). The chapter begins the second section of the book. Having been redeemed from Egypt, the people will now be granted a covenant with God. See also R. E.

It is here subordinated to the next clause as a temporal clause. But since the action of this temporal clause preceded the actions recorded in v. 1, a translation of "after" will keep the sequence in order.<br>
 <a name="fn1312" href="exo.htm#fnB1312"><sup>5</sup></a><b>sn</b> (19:2)  The mountain is Mount Sinai, the mountain of God, the place where God had met and called Moses, and promised that they would be here to worship him. If this mountain is Jebel Musa, the traditional site of Sinai, then the plain in front of it would be the plain Er-Rahah, a plain of about a mile and a half long by half a mile wide, fronting the mountain on the NW side (Driver, p. 169). The plain itself is about 5000 feet above sea level. <br>

Israel was to be God's special possession; but the prophets will later narrow it to the faithful remnant. All the nations belong to God, but Israel was to stand in a place of special privilege and enormous responsibility. See Deut 7:6; 14:2; 26:18; Ps 135:4; and Mal 3:17. See M. Greenburg, "Hebrew <i>s<sup>e</sup>gulla:</i> Akkadian <i>sikiltu," JAOS</i> 71 (1951): 172ff.<br>

 <a name="fn1322" href="exo.htm#fnB1322"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:6)  The construction of "a kingdom of priests" means that the kingdom is made up of priests. Kaiser offers four possible renderings of the expression: 1) apposition, viz., "kings, that is, priests; 2) as a construct with a genitive of specification, "royal priesthood"; 3) as a construct with the genitive being the attribute, "priestly kingdom"; and 4) reading with an unexpressed "and"-- "kings and priests." He takes the latter view that they were to be kings and priests (Kaiser, p. 417; other references are R. B. Y. Scott, "A Kingdom of Priests (Exodus xix. 6)," OTS 8 [1950]: 213-19; William L. Moran, "A Kingdom of Priests," <i>The Bible in Current Catholic Thought,</i> ed. J. McKenzie [NY: Herder &amp; Herder, 1962), 7-20). However, due to the parallelism of the next description which uses an adjective, this is probably a construct relationship. This kingdom of God will be comprised of a priestly people. All the Israelites would be living wholly in God's service, and enjoying the right of access to him. And, as priests, they would have the duty of representing God to the nations, following what they perceived to be the duties of priests--proclaiming God's word, interceding for people, and making provision for people to find God through atonement (see Deut 33:9,10). The emphasis on their being kings does not necessarily derive from this passage that refers to them as a kingdom.<br>
 <a name="fn1323" href="exo.htm#fnB1323"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:6)  They are also to be "a holy nation." They are to be a nation separate and distinct from the rest of the nation. Here is another aspect of their duty. It was one thing to be God's special possession; but to be that they had to be priestly and holy. The duties of the covenant will specify what it would mean to be a holy nation. In short, they had to keep themselves free from everything that characterized pagan people (Driver, p. 171). So it is a bilateral covenant: they received special privileges but they must provide special services by the special discipline. See also H. Kruse, "Exodus 19:5 and the Mission of Israel," <i>North East Asian Journal of Theology</i> 24/25 (1980):239-42.<br>
 <a name="fn1324" href="exo.htm#fnB1324"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:8)  The verb is the imperfect tense.

 <a name="fn1328" href="exo.htm#fnB1328"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:10)  This verb is the Piel perfect with the <i>vav</i> consecutive; it continues the force of the imperative preceding it.

 <a name="fn1332" href="exo.htm#fnB1332"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (19:13)  There is some ambiguity here. The clause either means that no man will touch the mountain, so that if there is someone who is to be put to death he must be stoned or shot since they could not go into the mountain region to get him, or, it may mean no one is to touch the culprit who went in to the region of the mountain. <br>

 <a name="fn1343" href="exo.htm#fnB1343"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:19)  The two verbs here ("spoke" and "answered") are imperfect tenses; they emphasize repeated action but in past time. The customary imperfect usually is translated "would" or "used to" do the action, but here continuous action in past time is meant. Driver translated it "kept speaking" and "kept answering" (p. 172). <br>
 <a name="fn1344" href="exo.htm#fnB1344"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:19)  The text simply has <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">loqB=</FONT> (<i>b<sup>e</sup>qol</i>); it could mean "with a voice" or it could mean "in thunder" since "voice" was used earlier for thunder. In this context it would be natural to say that the repeated thunderings were the voice of God--but how is that an answer? Deut 4:12 says that the people heard the sound of words. Cassuto rightly comments, "He was answering him with a loud voice so that it was possible for Moses to hear His words clearly in the midst of the storm." He then draws a parallel from Ugaritic where it tells that one of the gods was speaking in a loud voice (pp. 232-33).<br>

 <a name="fn1348" href="exo.htm#fnB1348"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:23)  The construction is emphatic: "because you--you solemnly warned us." Moses' response to God is to ask how they would break through when God had already charged them not to. God knew them better than Moses did.<br>
 <a name="fn1349" href="exo.htm#fnB1349"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (19:23)  <i>Heb</i> "sanctify it."<br>
 <a name="fn1350" href="exo.htm#fnB1350"><sup>43</sup></a><b>sn</b> (19:25)  The passage has many themes and emphases that could be developed in exposition. It could serve for meditation: the theology drawn from the three parts could be subordinated to the theme of holiness: God is holy, therefore adhere to his word for service, approach him through a mediator, and adore him in purity and fearful reverence. A developed outline for the exposition could be: I. If the people of God will obey him, they will be privileged to serve in a unique way (1-8); II. If the people of God are to obey, they must be convinced of the divine source of their commands (9); and finally, III. If the people of God are convinced of the divine approval of their mediator, and the divine source of their instructions, they must sanctify themselves before him (vv. 10-25). In sum, the manifestation of the holiness of Yahweh is the reason for sanctification and worship. The correlation is to be made through 1 Peter 2 to the church. The Church is a kingdom of priests; it is to obey the Word of God. What is the motivation for this? Our mediator is Jesus Christ; he has the approval of the Father and manifests the glory of God to us. And he declares the purpose of our calling is to declare his praises. We are to abstain from sin so that pagans can see our good works and glorify God.<br>
 <a name="fn1351" href="exo.htm#fnB1351"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:1)  This chapter is the heart of the Law of Israel, and as such is well known throughout the world. There is so much literature on it that it is almost impossible to say anything briefly and do justice to the subject. But the exposition of the book must point out that this is the charter of the new nation of Israel. These ten commands (words) form the preamble; they will be followed by the decisions (judgments). And then in chap. 24 the covenant will be inaugurated. So when Israel entered into covenant with God, they entered into a theocracy by expressing their willingness to submit to his authority. The Law was the binding constitution for the nation of Israel under Yahweh their God. It was specifically given to them at a certain time and in a certain place. The Law legislated how Israel was to live in order to be blessed by God and used by him as a kingdom of priests. In the process of legislating their conduct and their ritual for worship, the Law revealed God. It revealed the holiness of Yahweh as the standard for all worship and service, and in revealing that it revealed or uncovered sin. But what the Law condemned, the cultic Law (Leviticus) made provision for in the laws of the sacrifice and the feasts intended for atonement. The NT teaches that the Law was good, and perfect, and holy. But it also teaches that Christ was the end (goal) of the Law, that it ultimately led to him. It was a pedagogue, Paul said, to bring us to Christ. And when the fulfillment of the promise came in him, believers were not to go back under the Law. What this means for Christians is that what the Law of Israel revealed about God and his will is timeless and still authoritative over faith and conduct; but what the Law regulated for Israel in their existence as the people of God has been done away with in Christ. The Ten Commandments reveals the essence of the Law; its commands for the most part are reiterated in the NT because they reflect the holy and righteous nature of God. And yet the NT often raises them to a higher standard, to guard the spirit of the Law as well as the letter. <br>
 <a name="fn1352" href="exo.htm#fnB1352"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:1)  The Scripture makes it clear that the Law was the revelation of God at Mount Sinai. And yet, modern study has shown that the form of the law code follows the literary form of covenant codes in the Late Bronze Age, notably the Hittite codes. The point of such codes is that all the covenant stipulations are due to the lord or master because of the wonderful things that he has done for the people. But God, in using a well-known literary form, was both drawing on the people's knowledge of such to impress their duties on them, as well as putting new wine into old wineskins. The whole nature of God's code was on a much higher level--for he is God. For this general structure, see M.

 <a name="fn1353" href="exo.htm#fnB1353"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:2)  The revelation of Yahweh here begins with the personal pronoun. "I"--a person, a living personality, not an object or a mere thought. This enabled him to address "you"--Israel, and all his people, making the binding stipulations for them to conform to his will (Jacob, p. 544). <br>
 <a name="fn1354" href="exo.htm#fnB1354"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:2)  Most English translations have it "I am Yahweh your God." But the preceding chapters have again and again demonstrated how he made know to them. Now, the emphasis is on "I am your God"--and what that would mean in their lives.<br>
 <a name="fn1355" href="exo.htm#fnB1355"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:2)  The suffix on the verb is the second masculine singular form. It is this person that will be used throughout the commandments for the whole nation. God is addressing them all as his people; but he is addressing them individually for their obedience. The masculine form is not, thereby, intended to exclude women.<br>
 <a name="fn1356" href="exo.htm#fnB1356"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:2)  <i>Heb</i> "the house of slaves" meaning "the land of slavery."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (20:2)  By this announcement Yahweh declared what he had done for Israel by freeing them from slavery. Now they are free to serve him. He has a claim on them for gratitude and obedience. But this will not be a covenant of cruel slavery and oppression; it is a covenant of love, as God is saying "I am yours, and you are mine." This was the sovereign Lord of creation and of history speaking, declaring that he was their savior.<br>
 <a name="fn1357" href="exo.htm#fnB1357"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:3)  The possession is expressed here by the use of the <i>lamed </i>preposition and the verb "to be": <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">;l= hy#h=y]-aO</FONT> (<i>lo' yihyeh l<sup>e</sup>ka</i>), "there will not be to you." The negative with the imperfect expresses the emphatic prohibition; it is best reflected with "you will not" and has the strongest expectation of obedience (see GKC &#167;107.<i>o</i>). As an additional way of looking at this line, Cassuto suggests that the verb is in the singular in order to say that they could not have even one other god, and the word "gods" is plural to include any gods (p. 241).<br>
 <a name="fn1358" href="exo.htm#fnB1358"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:3)  The expression <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">y~n*P*-lu^</FONT> (<i>`al-panay</i>) has several possible interpretations. Driver suggests "in front of me," meaning obliging me to behold them, and also giving a prominence above me (193-94). Albright rendered it "You shall not prefer other gods to me" (<i>From the Stone Age to Christianity</i>, p. 297, n. 29). Jacob illustrates it with marriage: the wife could belong to only one man while every other man was "another man." They continued to exist but were not available to her (p. 546). The point is clear from the Law, regardless of the specific way the prepositional phrase is rendered. God demands absolute allegiance, to the exclusion of all other deities. And the preposition may imply some antagonism, for false gods would be opposed to Yahweh. Cassuto adds that God was in effect saying that anytime Israel turned to a false God they had to know that he was there--it is always in his presence, or before him (p. 241). <br>
 <a name="fn1359" href="exo.htm#fnB1359"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:4)  A <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ls#P#</FONT> (<i>pesel</i>) is an image that was carved out of wood or stone. The Law was concerned with a statue that would be made for the purpose of worship, an idol to be venerated, and not any ordinary statue. But <i>pesel</i> is the physical object that is created.<br>
 <a name="fn1360" href="exo.htm#fnB1360"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:4)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hn*WmT=</FONT> (<i>t<sup>e</sup>muna</i>) refers to the mental pattern from which the <i>pesel</i> is constructed; it is a real or imagined resemblance. If this is to stand as a second object to the verb, then the verb itself takes a slightly different nuance here. It would convey "you shall not make an image, neither shall you conceive a form" for worship (Jacob, p. 547). Some simply make the second word qualify the first: "you shall not make an idol in the form of..." (NIV).<br>

 <a name="fn1363" href="exo.htm#fnB1363"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:5)  The combination of these two verbs only refers to the worship of pagan deities (Stamm and Andrews, p. 86). The first verb is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hw\j&amp;T^v=t!-a)l</FONT> (<i>lo' tistahaweh</i>), now to be classified as a <i>hishtaphel</i> imperfect from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hvj</FONT> (<i>hawa</i> [s.v. <i>saha</i> in BDB]), "to cause oneself to be low to the ground." It is used of the true worship of God as well. The second verb is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;d@b=u*t* aOw+</FONT> (<i>w<sup>e</sup>lo' to'obdem</i>). The two could be taken as a hendiadys: "you will not prostrate yourself to serve them." In an interesting side comment Cassuto offers an explanation of the spelling of the second verb: he suggests that it was spelled with the <i>qames hatuph</i> vowels to show contempt for pagan worship, as if their conduct does not even warrant a correct spelling of the word "serve" (p. 242). Gesenius says that the forms like this are anomalous; but he wonders if they were pointed as if the verb was a Hophal, with the meaning "you shall not allow yourself to be brought to worship them" (GKC &#167;60.<i>b</i>). But this is unlikely.<br>
 <a name="fn1364" href="exo.htm#fnB1364"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:5)  The word "jealous" is the same word often translated "zeal" or "zealous." The word describes a passionate intensity to protect or defend something that is jeopardized. The word can also have the sense of "envy," but in that case the object is out of bounds. God's zeal or jealousy is to protect his people or his institutions or his honor. Yahweh's honor is bound up with the life of his people. <br>
 <a name="fn1365" href="exo.htm#fnB1365"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:5)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dqP</FONT> (<i>paqad</i>) is difficult to translate. It essentially means that God intervenes in the lives of people for blessing or for cursing. Some would simply translate the participle here as "punishing" the children for the sins of the fathers. That is workable, but may not say enough. The verse may mean that those who hate Yahweh and do not keep his commandments will repeat the sins their fathers committed and suffer for them. Deut 24:16 says that they will die for their own sins and not their father's sins. It may have more to do with the patterns of sin being repeated from generation to generation; if the sin and the guilt were not fully developed in the one generation, then left unchecked they would develop and continue in the next. But it may also indicate that the effects of the sins of the fathers will be experienced in the following generations. God is showing here that his ethical character is displayed in how he deals with sin and righteousness. There is a justice at work in the dealings of God that is not there in the pagan world.<br>
 <a name="fn1366" href="exo.htm#fnB1366"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:5)  This is an important qualification to the principle. The word "hate" carries with it the idea of rejecting God and his word. To hate God means to reject him and to defiantly oppose him. Such people are doomed to carry on the sins of their ancestors, and bear the guilt with them. <br>
 <a name="fn1367" href="exo.htm#fnB1367"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:6)  The wording literally has "doing loyal love" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ds#j# hC#u)</FONT> [<i>`oseh hesed</i>]). The noun refers to God's covenant, loyal love, his faithful love to those who belong to him. These folks are members of the covenant, recipients of grace, the people of God. The antithesis is at work here: God will preserve and protect his people from evil and its effects. <br>
 <a name="fn1368" href="exo.htm#fnB1368"><sup>18</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:6)  This is the antithesis of the preceding line. The "thousands" are those who belong to the ones who love Yahweh and keep his commands. These are descendants from the righteous, and even associates with them, who benefit from the mercy that God extends to his people. Driver says that this passage teaches that God's mercy transcends his wrath: in his providence the beneficent consequences of a life of goodness extend indefinitely further than the retribution which is the penalty for persisting in sin (p. 195). <br>

This would include false-swearing, pagan incantations, or idle talk. The name is to be treated with reverence and respect because it is the name of the holy God. <br>

 <a name="fn1372" href="exo.htm#fnB1372"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:8)  The text uses the infinitive absolute <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rokz*</FONT> (<i>zakor</i>) for the commandment for the sabbath day, which is the sign of the Sinaitic Covenant. The infinitive absolute functions in place of the emphatic imperative here (see GKC &#167;113.<i>bb</i>); the absolute stresses the basic verbal idea of the root--remembering. The verb includes the mental activity of recalling and pondering as well as the consequent actions for such remembering. <br>
 <a name="fn1373" href="exo.htm#fnB1373"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:8)  The word "sabbath" is clearly connected to the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tbv</FONT> (<i>sabat</i>), "to cease, desist, rest." There are all kinds of theories as to the origin of the day, most notably in the Babylonian world; but the differences are striking in so far as the pagan world had these days filled with magic. Nevertheless, the pagan world does bear witness to a tradition of a regular day set aside for special sacrifices. See, for example, H. W. Wolff, "The Day of Rest in the Old Testament," <i>LTQ</i> 7 (1972): 65-76; H. Routtenberg, "The Laws of Sabbath: Biblical Sources," <i>Dor leDor</i> 6 (1977): 41-43, 99-101, 153-55, 204-206; G.

Tsevat, "The Basic Meaning of the Biblical Sabbath," <i>ZAW</i> 84 (1972): 447-59.<br>
 <a name="fn1374" href="exo.htm#fnB1374"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:8)  The Piel infinitive construct provides the purpose of the remembering of the sabbath day--to set it apart, to make it distinct from the other days. Verses 9 and 10 will explain in part how this was to be done. To sanctify this day taught Israel the difference between the holy and the profane, that there was something higher than daily life. If he bent down to the ground laboring all week, the sabbath called his attention to the heavens, to pattern his life after the Creator (Jacob, pp. 569-70). <br>
 <a name="fn1375" href="exo.htm#fnB1375"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:9)  The text has simply "six days," but this is an adverbial accusative of time, answering how long they were to work (GKC &#167;118.<i>k</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn1376" href="exo.htm#fnB1376"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:9)  The imperfect tense has traditionally been rendered as a commandment, "you will labor." But the point of this commandment is the prohibition of work on the seventh day. The permission nuance of the imperfect works well here.<br>
 <a name="fn1377" href="exo.htm#fnB1377"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:9)  This is the occupation, or business of the work week. <br>

 <a name="fn1379" href="exo.htm#fnB1379"><sup>29</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:10)  The wife is omitted in the list, not that she was considered unimportant, nor that she was excluded from the rest, but rather in reflecting her high status. She was not man's servant, not lesser than the man, but included with the man as an equal before God. The "you" of the commandments is addressed to the Israelites individually, male and female, just as God in the Garden of Eden held both the man and the woman responsible for their individual sins (see Jacob, pp. 567-68). <br>
 <a name="fn1380" href="exo.htm#fnB1380"><sup>30</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:10)  The Sabbath Day was the sign of the Sinaitic Covenant. It required Israel to cease from ordinary labors and devote the day to God. It required Israel to enter into the life of God, to share his sabbath. It gave them a chance to recall the work of the Creator. But in the NT the apostolic teaching for the Church does not make one day holier than another, but calls for the entire life to be sanctified to God. This teaching is an application of the meaning of entering into the sabbath of God. The Book of Hebrews declares that those who believe in Christ cease from their works and enter into his sabbath rest. For a Christian keeping Saturday holy is not a requirement from the NT; it may be a good and valuable thing to have a day of rest and refreshment, but it is not a binding law for the Church. The principle of setting aside time to worship and serve the Lord has been carried forward; but the strict regulations have not.<br>
 <a name="fn1381" href="exo.htm#fnB1381"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:12)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dB@K^</FONT> (<i>kabbed</i>) is the Piel imperative; it calls for the people to give to their parents the respect and honor that is appropriate for them. It could be paraphrased to say, give them the proper weight of authority that they deserve. Next to God, parents were to be highly valued, cared for, and respected. <br>
 <a name="fn1382" href="exo.htm#fnB1382"><sup>32</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:12)  The promise here is national rather than individual, although it is certainly true that the blessing of life was promised for anyone who was obedient to God's commands (Deut 4:1, 8:1, etc.). But as Kaiser (p. 424) summarizes, the land that was promised was the land of Canaan; and the duration of Israel in the land was to be based on morality and the fear of God as expressed in the home (Deut 4:26, 33, 40; 32:46-47). The captivity was in part caused by a breakdown in this area (Ezek 22:7,15). And Malachi would announce at the end of his book that Elijah would come at the end of the age to turn the hearts of the children and the parents toward each other again.. <br>
 <a name="fn1383" href="exo.htm#fnB1383"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:13)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jXr</FONT> (<i>rasah</i>) refers to the premeditated or accidental taking of the life of another human being; it includes any unauthorized killing (it is used for the punishment of the murderer, and that would not be included here in the prohibition). This commandment teaches the sanctity of all human life. See J. H. Yoder, "Exodus 20,13: `Thou Shalt Not Kill'," <i>Int</i> 34 (1980): 394-99; and A. Phillips, "Another Look at Murder," <i>JJS</i> 28 (1977): 105-26. <br>
 <a name="fn1384" href="exo.htm#fnB1384"><sup>34</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:14)  This is a sin against the marriage of a fellow citizen--it destroys the home. The Law distinguished between adultery (which was a death penalty) and the sexual contact of a young woman (which carried a monetary fine and usually marriage if the father was willing). So it distinguished fornication and adultery. Both were sins, but the significance of each was different. In the ancient world this sin is often referred to as "the great sin."<br>
 <a name="fn1385" href="exo.htm#fnB1385"><sup>35</sup></a><b>sn</b> (20:15)  This law protected the property of the Israelite citizen. See D. Little, "Exodus 20,15: `Thou Shalt Not Steal'," <i>Int</i> 34 (1980): 399-405. <br>

In this verse the noun is an adverbial accusative, "you will not answer as a lying witness." The prohibition is against perjury. While the precise reference would be to legal proceedings, the law probably had a broader application to lying about other people in general (see Lev 5:1; Hos 4:2). <br>
 <a name="fn1388" href="exo.htm#fnB1388"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:17)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dmj</FONT> (<i>hamad</i>) focuses not on an external act but on an internal mental activity behind the act, the motivation for it. The word can be used in a very good sense (Ps 19:10; 68:16); but it has a bad connotation in contexts where the object desired is off limits. This command is aimed at curtailing the greedy desire for something belonging to a neighbor, a desire that leads to the taking of it or the attempt to take it. It was used in the story of the Garden of Eden for the tree that was desired. <br>

So, the verb "heard" is inserted here to clarify (p. 427).<br>

They, for the most part, are reiterated in the NT, in one way or another, usually with a much higher standard that requires attention to the spirit of the laws. Thus, these laws reveal God's standard of righteousness by revealing sin. No wonder the Israelites were afraid when they saw the manifestation of God and heard his laws. When the whole covenant is considered, preamble and all, then it becomes clear that the motivation for obeying the commands is the person and the work of the covenant God--the one who redeemed his people. Obedience then becomes a response of devotion and adoration to the Redeemer who set them free. It becomes loyal service, not enslavement to laws. The point could be worded this way: God requires that his covenant people, whom he has redeemed, and to whom he has revealed , give their absolute allegiance and obedience to him. This means they will worship and serve him, and safeguard the well-being of each other. <br>

The "peace offering" is legislated in Lev 3 and 7. This was a communal meal offering to celebrate being at peace with God. It was made usually for thanksgiving, for payment of vows, or as a freewill offering. <br>
 <a name="fn1408" href="exo.htm#fnB1408"><sup>58</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:24)  Gesenius lists this as one of the few places where the noun in construct seems to be indefinite in spite of the fact that the genitive has the article. He says <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;oqM*h^-lk*B=</FONT> (<i>b<sup>e</sup>kol-hammaqom</i>) means "in all the place, sc. of the sanctuary, and is a dogmatic correction of "in every place" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;oqm*-lK* </FONT>[<i>kol-maqom</i>]). See GKC &#167;127.<i>e</i>). <br>
 <a name="fn1409" href="exo.htm#fnB1409"><sup>59</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:24)  The verb is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rkz</FONT> (<i>zakar</i>), "to remember"; but in the Hiphil especially it can mean more than remember, or cause to remember (remind)--it has the sense of praise or honor. Childs says it has a denominative meaning, "to proclaim" (p. 447). The point of the verse is that God will give Israel reason for praising and honoring him, and in every place that occurs he will make his presence known by blessing them.<br>
 <a name="fn1410" href="exo.htm#fnB1410"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:25)  <i>Heb</i> "them" referring to the stones.<br>
 <a name="fn1411" href="exo.htm#fnB1411"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:25)  Gesenius classifies this as an adverbial accusative-- "you shall not build them (the stones of the altar) as hewn stones." The remoter accusative is in apposition to the nearer (GKC &#167;117.<i>kk</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn1412" href="exo.htm#fnB1412"><sup>62</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:25)  The verb is a preterite with the <i>vav</i> consecutive. It forms the apodosis in a conditional clause: "if you lift up your tool on it...you will defile it." The nuance of anterior future fits this context very well. <br>
 <a name="fn1413" href="exo.htm#fnB1413"><sup>63</sup></a><b>tn</b> (20:26)  <i>Heb</i> "uncovered." <br>
 <a name="fn1414" href="exo.htm#fnB1414"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:1)  There follows now a series of rulings called "decisions" or "judgments" (in the Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yf!P*v=M!h^</FONT> [<i>hammispatim</i>]). A precept is stated, and then various cases in which the law is applicable are examined. These are all taken in harmony with the Decalogue that has just been given. All the laws can be grouped into three categories: civil or criminal laws, religious or cultic laws, and moral or humanitarian laws. The civil and criminal laws make up most of chap. 21; the next two chapters mix the other kinds of laws. There is a great deal of literature on this section of the book. Among them are: F. C. Fensham, "The Role of the Lord in the Legal Sections of the Covenant Code," <i>VT</i> 26 (1976): 262-74; S. Paul, "Unrecognized Biblical Legal Idioms in Light of Comparative Akkadian Expressions," <i>RB </i>86 (1979): 231-39; M. Galston, "The Purpose of the Law According to Maimonides," <i>JQR</i> 69 (1978): 27-51.<br>
 <a name="fn1415" href="exo.htm#fnB1415"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:2)  See H. L. Elleson, "The Hebrew Slave: A Study in Early Israelite Society," <i>EvQ</i> 45 (1973): 30-35; N. P.

 <a name="fn1416" href="exo.htm#fnB1416"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:2)  The tenses in both the conditional clause and the following ruling are imperfect tenses: If you buy...then he will serve." The second imperfect tense being the ruling could be taken either as a specific future or an obligatory imperfect. Gesenius explains how the verb works in the conditional clauses here (see GKC &#167;159.<i>bb</i>). <br>
 <a name="fn1417" href="exo.htm#fnB1417"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:2)  The interpretation of "Hebrew" in this verse is uncertain: (l) a gentilic ending, (2) a fellow Israelite, (3) or a class of mercenaries of the population (see Kaiser, p. 431). It seems likely that the term describes someone born a Hebrew, as opposed to a foreigner (Driver, p. 210). The literature on this includes: M. P. Gray, "The <i>Habiru</i>-Hebrew Problem," <i>HUCA</i> 29 (1958): 135-202.<br>
 <a name="fn1418" href="exo.htm#fnB1418"><sup>5</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:2)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yv!p=j*</FONT> (<i>hopsi</i>) means "free." It is possible that there is some connection between this word and a technical term used in other cultures for a social class of emancipated slaves who were freemen again (see I. Mendelsohn, "New Light on the <i>Hupsu</i>," <i>BASOR</i> 139 [1955]: 9-11). <br>
 <a name="fn1419" href="exo.htm#fnB1419"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:2)  The adverb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;N*j!</FONT> (<i>hinnam</i>) means "gratis, free"; it is related to the word "to be gracious, show favor: and the noun "grace."<br>
 <a name="fn1420" href="exo.htm#fnB1420"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:3)  The tense is the imperfect tense; but in the conditional clause it clearly refers to action that is anterior to the action in the next clause. <i>Heb</i> "if he comes it single, he goes out single," but it means "if he came in single, he will go out single."<br>
 <a name="fn1421" href="exo.htm#fnB1421"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:3)  <i>Heb</i> "with his back" meaning "alone."<br>
 <a name="fn1422" href="exo.htm#fnB1422"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:3)  The phrase says, "if he was the possessor of a wife"; the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lu^B^</FONT> (<i>ba'al</i>) can mean "possessor" or "husband." If there was a wife, she shared his fortunes or his servitude; if he entered with her, she would accompany him when he left.<br>
 <a name="fn1423" href="exo.htm#fnB1423"><sup>10</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:4)  The slave would not have the right, nor the means to acquire a wife. Thus, the idea of the master's "giving" him a wife is clear--the master would have to pay the prices and make the provision. In this case, the wife and the children are actually the possession of the master unless the slave were to pay the bride price--but he is a slave because he got into debt. The law shows that they believed the master was better able to provide for this woman than the freed slave, and that it was most important to keep the children with the mother. <br>
 <a name="fn1424" href="exo.htm#fnB1424"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:5)  The imperfect with the infinitive absolute means that the declaration is unambiguous, that the servant will clearly affirm that he wants to stay with the master. Gesenius says that in a case like this the infinitive emphasizes the importance of the condition on which some consequence depends (GKC &#167;113.<i>o</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn1425" href="exo.htm#fnB1425"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:5)  Or taken as a desiderative imperfect, it would say, "I do not want to go out free."<br>
 <a name="fn1426" href="exo.htm#fnB1426"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:6)  The word is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yh!Ooa$h*</FONT> (<i>ha'elohim</i>). Driver says it should mean "to God," namely the nearest sanctuary in order that the oath and the ritual might be made solemn, although he does say that it would be done by human judges (p. 211). That the reference is to Yahweh God is the view also of F. C. Fensham, "New Light on Exodus 21:7 and 22:7 from the Laws of Eshnunna," <i>JBL </i>78 (1959): 160-61. Others have made a stronger case that it refers to judges who acted on behalf of God; see C. Gordon, "<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yhla</FONT> in its Reputed Meaning of Rulers, Judges," <i>JBL</i> 54 (1935): 134-44; and A. E. Draffkorn, "Ilani/Elohim," <i>JBL</i> 76 (1957): 216-24. <br>
 <a name="fn1427" href="exo.htm#fnB1427"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:6)  Or "till his life's end" (as in the idiom: "serve him for good").<br>
 <a name="fn1428" href="exo.htm#fnB1428"><sup>15</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:7)  This paragraph is troubling to the modern Christian; but given the way that marriages were contracted and the way people lived in the ancient world, it actually is a good provision for the people who might want to find a better life for the daughter. On the subject in general for this chapter, see W. M. Swartley, <i>Slavery, Sabbath, War and Women</i> (Scottsdale, PA: Herald, 1983), 31-64.<br>
 <a name="fn1429" href="exo.htm#fnB1429"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:7)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*a*</FONT> (`<i>ama</i>) refers to a female servant who would eventually become a concubine or wife; the sale price included the amount for the service as well as the bride price (see Jacob, p. 621). The arrangement recognized her honor as an Israelite woman, one who could be a wife, even though she entered the household in service. The marriage was not automatic, as the conditions show, but her treatment was safeguarded come what may. The law was a way, then, for a poor man to provide a better life for a daughter. <br>
 <a name="fn1430" href="exo.htm#fnB1430"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:8)  <i>Heb</i> "and if unpleasant (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hu*r*</FONT> [<i>ra'a</i>]) in the eyes of her master."<br>
 <a name="fn1431" href="exo.htm#fnB1431"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:8)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">duy</FONT> (<i>ya'ad</i>) does not mean "betroth, espouse" as some of the earlier translations had it, but "to designate." This verse means that when he bought the girl he designated her for himself.<br>
 <a name="fn1432" href="exo.htm#fnB1432"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:8)  The verb is the Hiphil perfect with a <i>vav</i> consecutive of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hdp</FONT> (<i>pada</i>), "to redeem." Here is the apodosis the form is equivalent to an imperfect: "let someone redeem her"--perhaps her father if he can, or another. Cassuto says it can also mean she can redeem herself and dissolve the relationship (p. 268). <br>
 <a name="fn1433" href="exo.htm#fnB1433"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:8)  <i>Heb</i> "he has no authority/power," for the verb means "rule, have dominion."<br>
 <a name="fn1434" href="exo.htm#fnB1434"><sup>21</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:8)  The deceit, or more precisely the treachery, is in not making her his wife or concubine as the arrangement had stipulated. <br>
 <a name="fn1435" href="exo.htm#fnB1435"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:9)  Or "customary rights."<br>
 <a name="fn1436" href="exo.htm#fnB1436"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:10)  "wife" has been supplied.<br>
 <a name="fn1437" href="exo.htm#fnB1437"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:10)  The translation of "food" does not really do justice to the Hebrew word. It is "flesh." The point of this word here is that the family she was to marry into is wealthy, they ate meat. She was not just to be given the basic food the ordinary people eat, but the fine foods that this family ate.<br>
 <a name="fn1438" href="exo.htm#fnB1438"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:10)  See S. Paul, "Exodus 21:10, A Threefold Maintenance Clause," <i>JNES</i> 28 (1969): 48-53. Paul suggests that the third element listed is not marital rights but ointments since Sumerian and Akkadian texts list food, clothing, and oil as the necessities of life. The translation of "marital rights" is far from certain, since the word only occurs here. The point is that the woman was to be cared for with all that was required for a woman in that situation. <br>
 <a name="fn1439" href="exo.htm#fnB1439"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:11)  The lessons of slavery and service are designed to bring about justice to existing customs in antiquity. The message here is: Those is slavery for one reason or another should have the hope of freedom and the choice of service (vv. 2-6). For the rulings on the daughter, the message could be: Women, who were often at the mercy of their husbands or masters, must not be trapped in an unfortunate situation, but be treated well by their masters or husbands (vv. 7-11). God is preventing people who have power over others from abusing it.<br>
 <a name="fn1440" href="exo.htm#fnB1440"><sup>27</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:12)  The underlying point of this section remains true today: The people of God must treat all human life as sacred. <br>
 <a name="fn1441" href="exo.htm#fnB1441"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:12)  The construction uses the Hiphil<i> </i>participle in construct with the noun for "man" (or person as is understood in a law for the nation): "the one striking [of] a man." This is a <i>casus pendens</i> (independent nominative absolute); it indicates the condition or action which involves further consequence (GKC &#167;116.<i>w</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn1442" href="exo.htm#fnB1442"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:12)  <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tm@w</FONT> (<i>wamet</i>) is the Qal perfect with the <i>vav</i> consecutive; it means "and he dies" and not "and killed him" (which require another stem). Gesenius notes that this form after a participle is the equivalent of a sentence representing a contingent action (GKC &#167;112.<i>n</i>). The word shows the result of the action in the opening participle. It is therefore a case of murder or manslaughter. <br>
 <a name="fn1443" href="exo.htm#fnB1443"><sup>30</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:12)  See A. Phillips, "Another Look at Murder," <i>JJS</i> 28 (1977): 105-26.<br>
 <a name="fn1444" href="exo.htm#fnB1444"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:13)  <i>Heb</i> "if he does not lie in wait."<br>
 <a name="fn1445" href="exo.htm#fnB1445"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:14)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*r+u*</FONT> (<i>`orma</i>) is problematic. It could mean with prior intent, which would be connected with the word in Prov 8:5, 12 which means "understanding" (or "prudence"--fully aware of the way things are). It could be connected also to an Arabic word for "enemy" which would indicate this was done with malice or evil intentions (U. Cassuto, p. 270).<br>
 <a name="fn1446" href="exo.htm#fnB1446"><sup>33</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:15)  This is the same construction that was used in v. 12, but here there is no mention of the parents death. This attack, then, does not lead to their death--if he killed one of them than v. 12 would be the law. Driver says that the severity of the penalty was in accord with the high view of parents (p. 216).<br>
 <a name="fn1447" href="exo.htm#fnB1447"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:16)  <i>Heb</i> "a stealer of a man," so "anyone stealing a man."<br>
 <a name="fn1448" href="exo.htm#fnB1448"><sup>35</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:16)  The implication here is that it would be an Israelite citizen who was kidnapped and sold to a foreign tribe or country (like Joseph). There was always a market for slaves. But the crime would be in taking the individual away from his home and religion and putting him into bondage or death. <br>
 <a name="fn1449" href="exo.htm#fnB1449"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:16)  Literally "and he is found in his hand," the expression probably means that the victim is found in his hand, but could also be read that the culprit is found with him in his possession. In either case, the meaning of the verse is clear that he has not sold the individual yet.<br>
 <a name="fn1450" href="exo.htm#fnB1450"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:17)  The form is the Piel participle of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">llq</FONT> (<i>qalal</i>), "to be light," and so in this stem "to treat lightly, to curse." The word is the antonym of "honor" ("be heavy"). It does not in itself mean "to curse" but rather "dishonor." This verse then could mean any act contrary to the ruling of honoring the parents. Jacob cites parallels in Sumerian where people were severely punished for publicly disowning their parents (see p. 640).<br>
 <a name="fn1451" href="exo.htm#fnB1451"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:18)  <i>Heb</i> "falls to bed."<br>
 <a name="fn1452" href="exo.htm#fnB1452"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:19)  "and then" has been supplied.<br>
 <a name="fn1453" href="exo.htm#fnB1453"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:19)  The verb is the Hitpael perfect with the <i>vav </i>consecutive; it follows the sequence of the imperfect before it-- "if he gets up and walks about." This is proof of recovery. <br>
 <a name="fn1454" href="exo.htm#fnB1454"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:19)  The imperfect tense carries a nuance of obligatory imperfect because this is binding on the one who hit him.<br>
 <a name="fn1455" href="exo.htm#fnB1455"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:19)  <i>Heb</i> "his"; the referent (the injured person) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn1456" href="exo.htm#fnB1456"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:19)  The word appears to be the infinitive from the verb "to sit" with a meaning of "his sitting down"; some suggest from the verb "to rest" with a meaning "cease." In either case the point in the context must mean compensation is due for the time he was down.<br>
 <a name="fn1457" href="exo.htm#fnB1457"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn </b> (21:20) <i>Heb</i> "so that he"; the words "or she" have been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.<br>
 <a name="fn1458" href="exo.htm#fnB1458"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:20)  <i>Heb</i> "under his hand."<br>
 <a name="fn1459" href="exo.htm#fnB1459"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:20)  <i>Heb</i> "will be avenged" (which is not specified).<br>
 <a name="fn1460" href="exo.htm#fnB1460"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:21)  <i>Heb</i> "if he"; the referent (the servant struck and injured in the previous verse) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>

 <a name="fn1462" href="exo.htm#fnB1462"><sup>49</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:21)  This last clause is a free paraphrase of the line that simple says, "for he is his money." The point of the verse is that if the slave survives a couple of days, it is probable that the master was punishing him and not intending to kill him. If he then dies, there is no punishment other than that the owner loses the slave who is his property--he suffers the loss.<br>
 <a name="fn1463" href="exo.htm#fnB1463"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:22)  This line has occasioned a good deal of discussion. It may indicate that the child was killed, as in a miscarriage; or it may mean that there was a premature birth. The latter view is taken here because of the way the whole section is written: (1) "her children come out" reflects a birth and not the loss of children, (2) there is no serious damage, and (3) payment is to be set for any remuneration. The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/osa*</FONT> (<i>`ason</i>) is translated "serious damage." The word was taken in <i>Mekilta</i> to mean "death." Cassuto says the point of the phrase is that neither the woman or the children that are born die (p. 275). But see among the literature on this: M. G. Kline, "<i>Lex Talionis </i>and the Human Fetus," <i>JETS</i> 20 (1977): 193-201; W. House, "Miscarriage or Premature Birth: Additional Thoughts on Exodus 21:22-25," <i>WTJ</i> 41 (1978): 108-23; S. E. Loewenstamm, "Exodus XXI 22-25," <i>VT</i> 27 (1977): 352-60.<br>
 <a name="fn1464" href="exo.htm#fnB1464"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:22)  The word<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> &lt;yl!l!p=B!</FONT> (<i>biplilim</i>) means "with arbitrators." The point then seems to be that the amount of remuneration for damages that was fixed by the husband had to be approved by the courts. Driver mentions an alternative to this unusual reading presented by Budde, reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ylpnb</FONT> as "untimely birth" (p. 219). See also E. A. Speiser, "The Stem PLL in Hebrew," <i>JBL</i> 82 (1963): 301-306.<br>

 <a name="fn1467" href="exo.htm#fnB1467"><sup>54</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:26)  Interestingly, the verb used here for "let him go" is the same verb throughout the first part of the book for Pharaoh to "release" the Israelites from slavery.

 <a name="fn1473" href="exo.htm#fnB1473"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:29)  This is a rather free paraphrase, because the Hebrew says "he was not keeping it" or perhaps guarding or watching it. <br>

 <a name="fn1482" href="exo.htm#fnB1482"><sup>69</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:36)  The construction now uses the same Piel imperfect (v. 34) but adds the infinitive absolute to it for emphasis.<br>
 <a name="fn1483" href="exo.htm#fnB1483"><sup>70</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:36)  The point of this section (21:28-36) seems to be that one must ensure the safety of others by controlling one's property and possessions. This section pertained to neglect with animals; but the message would have applied to similar situations. The people of God were to take heed to ensure the well being of others, and if there was a problem, it had to be made right. <br>
 <a name="fn1484" href="exo.htm#fnB1484"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:1)  The next section of laws concerns property rights. These laws protected property from thieves and oppressors, but also set limits to retribution. The message could be: God's laws demand that the guilty make restitution for their crimes against property and that the innocent be exonerated. <br>
 <a name="fn1485" href="exo.htm#fnB1485"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (21:37)  Beginning with <b>22:1</b>, the verse numbers through <b>22:31</b> in the English Bible differ from the verse numbers in the Hebrew text (<i>BHS</i>), with <b>22:1 </b>ET = <b>21:37</b> HT, <b>22:2 </b>ET = <b>22:1</b> HT, etc., through <b>22:31</b> ET = <b>22:30</b> HT. Thus in the English Bible ch. 22 has 31 verses, while in the Hebrew Bible it has 30 verses, with the one extra verse attached to ch. 21 in the Hebrew Bible.<br>
 <a name="fn1486" href="exo.htm#fnB1486"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:37)  The imperfect tense here is given the nuance of obligatory imperfect--he must pay back.<br>
 <a name="fn1487" href="exo.htm#fnB1487"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (21:37)  <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rqB</FONT> (<i>baqar</i>) and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/aX)</FONT> (<i>so'n</i>) are the species to which the ox and the sheep belonged, so that the criminal had some latitude in paying back animals.<br>
 <a name="fn1488" href="exo.htm#fnB1488"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:2)  <i>Heb</i> "found."<br>
 <a name="fn1489" href="exo.htm#fnB1489"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:2)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tr#T#j=M^B^</FONT> (<i>bammahteret</i>) means "digging through" the walls of a house (usually made of mud bricks). The verb is only used a few times with the meaning of dig in (as in houses) or row hard (as in Jonah). The noun only occurs a couple of times.<br>
 <a name="fn1490" href="exo.htm#fnB1490"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:2)  The text has "there is not to him bloods." When the word "blood" is put in the plural, it refers to bloodshed, or the price of blood that is shed, i.e., blood guiltiness.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (22:2)  This law focuses on what is reasonable defense against burglary. If someone killed a thief who was breaking in during the night, he was not charged because he would not have known it was just a thief; but if it happened during the day, he was guilty of a crime, because no excuse could be made for killing a thief in broad daylight. <br>
 <a name="fn1491" href="exo.htm#fnB1491"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:3)  The words "A thief" have been added for clarification. Driver thinks that these lines are out of order since some of them deal with killing the thief and then others with the thief making restitution; but rearranging the clauses is not a necessary way to bring clarity to the paragraph (see p. 224). The idea here would be that a thief caught during the day would make restitution, because he would be less likely killed by the homeowner. <br>
 <a name="fn1492" href="exo.htm#fnB1492"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:4)  The construction uses the Niphal<i> </i>infinitive absolute and the Niphal imperfect: if it should indeed be found. Gesenius says that in such conditional clauses the infinitive absolute has less emphasis, but instead emphasizes the condition on which some consequence depends (see GKC &#167;113.<i>o</i>). <br>
 <a name="fn1493" href="exo.htm#fnB1493"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:4)  <i>Heb</i> "in his hand."<br>
 <a name="fn1494" href="exo.htm#fnB1494"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:4)  He must pay back one for what he took, and then one for the penalty--his loss as he was inflicting a loss on someone else. <br>
 <a name="fn1495" href="exo.htm#fnB1495"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:5)  This verse may in fact be totally different. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rub</FONT> (<i>ba'ar</i>), "graze," as a denominative from the word "livestock" is not well attested. So some have suggested that with slight changes this verse could be read: "If a man cause a field or a vineyard to be burnt, and let the burning spread, and it burnt in another man's field" (see Driver, p. 225). <br>
 <a name="fn1496" href="exo.htm#fnB1496"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:5)  "his livestock" is supplied from the next clause.<br>
 <a name="fn1497" href="exo.htm#fnB1497"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:6)  <i>Heb</i> "if a fire goes out and finds."<br>
 <a name="fn1498" href="exo.htm#fnB1498"><sup>15</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:6)  Thorn bushes were used for hedges between fields; but thornbushes also burnt very quickly, making the fire spread rapidly. <br>
 <a name="fn1499" href="exo.htm#fnB1499"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:6)  This is the Hiphil participle of the verb "to burn, kindle" used substantivally. This is the one who set or started or caused the fire, whether by accident or not.<br>
 <a name="fn1500" href="exo.htm#fnB1500"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:7)  The word usually means "vessels" but can have the sense of household goods and articles. It could be anything from jewels and ornaments to weapons or pottery.<br>
 <a name="fn1501" href="exo.htm#fnB1501"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:7)  <i>Heb</i> "to keep."<br>

 <a name="fn1503" href="exo.htm#fnB1503"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:8)  <i>Heb</i> "found."<br>
 <a name="fn1504" href="exo.htm#fnB1504"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:8)  Here again the word used is "the gods," meaning the judges who made the assessments and decisions. In addition to the bibliography listed earlier, see J. R. Vannoy, "The Use of the Word <i>ha'elohim</i> in Exodus 21:6 and 22:7,8," in <i>The Law and the Prophets: Old Testament Studies Prepared in Honor of Oswald Allis</i> (Nutley, N.J.: Presbyterian and Reformed, 1974), 225-41. <br>
 <a name="fn1505" href="exo.htm#fnB1505"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:8)  "to see" has been supplied.<br>
 <a name="fn1506" href="exo.htm#fnB1506"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:8)  The line says "if he has not stretched out his hand." This could either be the oath formula, but the construction here would be unusual, or it could be taken as "whether" (see Kaiser, p. 438). Cassuto does not think the wording can possibly fit an oath; nevertheless, an oath would be involved before God (as he takes it instead of "judges")--if the man swore his word would be accepted, but if he would not swear, he would be guilty (p. 286).<br>
 <a name="fn1507" href="exo.htm#fnB1507"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:9)  <i>Heb</i> "concerning every kind [thing] of trespass."<br>
 <a name="fn1508" href="exo.htm#fnB1508"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:9)  The text simply has "this is it" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hz# aWh</FONT> [<i>hu' zeh</i>]).<br>
 <a name="fn1509" href="exo.htm#fnB1509"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:9)  Again, or "God."<br>
 <a name="fn1510" href="exo.htm#fnB1510"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:9)  This kind of clause Gesenius calls an independent relative clause--it does not depend on a governing substantive but itself expresses a substantival idea (GKC &#167;138.<i>e</i>). <br>
 <a name="fn1511" href="exo.htm#fnB1511"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:9)  The verb means "to be guilty" in the Qal; in the Hiphil it would have a declarative sense, because a causative sense would not possibly fit.<br>
 <a name="fn1512" href="exo.htm#fnB1512"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:10)  The form is the Niphal participle from the verb "to break"-- "is broken," which means harmed, maimed, or hurt in any way.<br>
 <a name="fn1513" href="exo.htm#fnB1513"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:10)  This verb is frequently used with the meaning "to take captive." The idea here then is that raiders or robbers have carried off the animal.<br>
 <a name="fn1514" href="exo.htm#fnB1514"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:10)  <i>Heb</i> "there is no one seeing."<br>
 <a name="fn1515" href="exo.htm#fnB1515"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:11)  The construct relationship <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hw*hy= tu^b%v=</FONT> (<i>s<sup>e</sup>bu'at YHWH</i>), "the oath of Yahweh," would require a genitive of indirect object, "an oath [to] Yahweh." Cassuto suggests that it should mean "an oath by Yahweh" (p. 287). The person to whom the animal was entrusted would take a solemn oath to Yahweh that he did not appropriate the animal for himself, and then his word would be accepted.<br>
 <a name="fn1516" href="exo.htm#fnB1516"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:12)  Both with this verb "stolen" and the next clauses "torn in pieces" the text uses the infinitive absolute construction with less than normal emphasis; as Gesenius says, in the conditional clauses it emphasizes the important of the condition on which some consequence depends (GKC &#167;113.<i>o</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn1517" href="exo.htm#fnB1517"><sup>34</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:12)  The point of this verse is that the man should have taken better care of the animal. <br>
 <a name="fn1518" href="exo.htm#fnB1518"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:13)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">du@</FONT> (<i>`ed</i>) actually means "witness," but the dead animal that is returned is a silent witness, i.e., evidence. The word is an adverbial accusative. <br>
 <a name="fn1519" href="exo.htm#fnB1519"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:14)  <i>Heb</i> "if a man asks [an animal] from his neighbor." The verb is "to ask" (see also Exod 12:36). The ruling here implies an animal is borrowed, and if harm comes to it if the owner is not with it the borrower is liable. The word "animal" is supplied in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn1520" href="exo.htm#fnB1520"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:15)  Literally "it came with/for its hire," this expression implies that the owner who hired it out was prepared to take the risk, so there would be no compensation.<br>
 <a name="fn1521" href="exo.htm#fnB1521"><sup>38</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:16)  The second half of the chapter records various laws of purity and justice. Any of them could be treated in an expository way; but in the present array they offer a nice survey of God's righteous standards: Maintain the sanctity of marriage (16,170; maintain the purity of religious institutions (18-20), maintain the rights of human beings (21-28), maintain the rights of Yahweh (29-31). <br>
 <a name="fn1522" href="exo.htm#fnB1522"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:16)  This is the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hl*WtB=</FONT> (<i>b<sup>e</sup>tula</i>); it describes a young woman who is not married, or a young woman engaged to be married; in any case, she is presumed to be a virgin.<br>
 <a name="fn1523" href="exo.htm#fnB1523"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:16)  Or "pledged" for marriage.<br>
 <a name="fn1524" href="exo.htm#fnB1524"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:16)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rhm</FONT> (<i>mahar</i>) means "pay the marriage price" and the noun is the bride price. Jacob says this was a proposal gift and not a purchase price (p. 700). This is the price paid to her parents, which allowed for provision should there be a divorce. The amount was usually agreed on by the two families, but the price was higher for a pure bride from a noble family.. Here, the one who seduces her must pay it, regardless of whether he marries her or not. There is compensation.<br>
 <a name="fn1525" href="exo.htm#fnB1525"><sup>42</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:18)  As strict as the faith in Yahweh was, there still were many who wished to follow pagan beliefs and consort with the dead. Deut 18:10, 11 give the catalog of different actions included here. The sorceress was someone who dealt with drugs or herbs for all kinds of purposes. <br>
 <a name="fn1526" href="exo.htm#fnB1526"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:19)  <i>Heb</i> "lies with."<br>
 <a name="fn1527" href="exo.htm#fnB1527"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:20)  <i>Heb</i> "not to Yahweh."<br>
 <a name="fn1528" href="exo.htm#fnB1528"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:20)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;rj</FONT> (<i>haram</i>) means "to be devoted" to God or "to be banned." The idea is that it would be God's to do with as he liked. What was put under the ban was for God alone, either for his service, or for his judgment. But it was out of human control. Here the verb is saying that the person will be utterly destroyed.<br>
 <a name="fn1529" href="exo.htm#fnB1529"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:21)  Or "oppress."<br>
 <a name="fn1530" href="exo.htm#fnB1530"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:21)  The "alien" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rG@</FONT> [<i>ger</i>]) is a resident foreigner; he lives in the land but has no civic or legal rights.<br>
 <a name="fn1531" href="exo.htm#fnB1531"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:22)  The verb "afflict" is the Piel imperfect of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnu</FONT> (<i>`ana</i>); it has a wide range of meanings from "afflict, oppress, humiliate, rape." These victims are at the mercy of the judges, business men, or villain. The righteous king and the righteous people will not mistreat tham (see Isa 1:17; Job 31:16,17,21).<br>
 <a name="fn1532" href="exo.htm#fnB1532"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:23)  The accusative here is the masculine singular pronoun, which leads Driver to conclude that this line is out of place, even though the masculine singular can be used in places like this (Driver, p. 232). Cassuto says its use is to refer to certain classes (p. 292).<br>
 <a name="fn1533" href="exo.htm#fnB1533"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:23)  Here again the infinitive absolute functions in a diminished emphasis (GKC &#167;113.<i>o</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn1534" href="exo.htm#fnB1534"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:23)  The same use of the infinitive absolute is here.<br>
 <a name="fn1535" href="exo.htm#fnB1535"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:23)  Here is the normal use of the infinitive absolute with the imperfect tense to emphasize the verb: "I will surely hear," meaning, "I will surely respond."<br>
 <a name="fn1536" href="exo.htm#fnB1536"><sup>53</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:24)  The punishment will follow the form of talionic justice, an eye for an eye. God will use invading armies ("sword" is a metonymy of adjunct here) to destroy them, making their wives widows and their children orphans. <br>
 <a name="fn1537" href="exo.htm#fnB1537"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:25)  "any of" has been supplied.<br>
 <a name="fn1538" href="exo.htm#fnB1538"><sup>55</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:25)  The money-lender will be demanding and exacting. In Ps 109:11 and 2 Kgs 4:1 the word is rendered as "extortioner." <br>
 <a name="fn1539" href="exo.htm#fnB1539"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:25)  <i>Heb</i> "set."<br>
 <a name="fn1540" href="exo.htm#fnB1540"><sup>57</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:25)  In ancient times money was lent primarily for poverty and not for commercial ventures (H. Gamoran, "The Biblical Law Against Loans on Interest," <i>JNES</i> 30 [1971]: 127-34). The lending to the poor was essentially a charity, and so not to be an opportunity to make money from another person's misfortune. The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ev#n#</FONT> (<i>nesek</i>) may be derived from a verb that means "to bite," and so the idea of usury or interest was that of putting out one's money with a bite in it (See S. Stein, "The Laws On Interest in the Old Testament," <i>JTS</i> 4 [1953], and E. Neufeld, "The Prohibition Against Loans at Interest in the Old Testament," <i>HUCA</i> 26 [1955]).<br>
 <a name="fn1541" href="exo.htm#fnB1541"><sup>58</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:26)  The construction again uses the infinitive absolute with the verb in the conditional clause to stress the condition.<br>
 <a name="fn1542" href="exo.htm#fnB1542"><sup>59</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:26)  The clause uses the preposition, the infinitive construct, and the noun that is the subjective genitive-- "at the going in of the sun."<br>
 <a name="fn1543" href="exo.htm#fnB1543"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:27)  <i>Heb</i> "his skin."<br>
 <a name="fn1544" href="exo.htm#fnB1544"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:27)  Literally the text reads, "In what can he lie down?" The cloak would be used for a covering at night to use when sleeping. The garment, then, was the property that could not be taken and not given back--it was the last possession. The modern idiom of "the shirt off his back" gets at the point being made here.<br>
 <a name="fn1545" href="exo.htm#fnB1545"><sup>62</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:27)  <i>Heb</i> "and it will be."<br>
 <a name="fn1546" href="exo.htm#fnB1546"><sup>63</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:28)  The two verbs in this verse are synonyms: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">llq</FONT> (<i>qalal</i>) means "to treat lightly, curse," and <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rra</FONT> (<i>`arar</i>) means "to curse." <br>
 <a name="fn1547" href="exo.htm#fnB1547"><sup>64</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:28)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yh!Oa$</FONT> (<i>`elohim</i>) is "gods" or "God." If taken as the simple plural, it could refer to the human judges, as it has in the section of laws; this would match the parallelism in the verse. If it was taken to refer to God, then the idea of cursing God would be more along the line of blasphemy. Jacob says that the word refers to functioning judges, and that would indirectly mean God, for they represented the religious authority, and the prince the civil authority (p. 708).<br>
 <a name="fn1548" href="exo.htm#fnB1548"><sup>65</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:29)  The expressions are unusual. Cassuto renders them: "from the fullness of your harvest and from the outflow of your presses" (p. 294). He adds the Hittite parallel material to show that the people were to bring the offerings on time and not let them overlap, because the firstfruit had to be eaten first by the priest.<br>
 <a name="fn1549" href="exo.htm#fnB1549"><sup>66</sup></a><b>sn</b> (22:31)  The use of this word here has to do with the cultic laws of the sanctuary and not some advanced view of holiness. The ritual holiness at the sanctuary would prohibit eating anything torn to pieces. <br>
 <a name="fn1550" href="exo.htm#fnB1550"><sup>67</sup></a><b>tn</b> (22:31)  Or "by wild animals."<br>
 <a name="fn1551" href="exo.htm#fnB1551"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (23:1)  People who claim to worship and serve the righteous judge of the universe must preserve equity and justice in their dealings with others. In these verses we learn: God's people must be honest witnesses (1-3); God's people must be righteous even with enemies (4,5); and God's people must be fair in justice (6-9). <br>
 <a name="fn1552" href="exo.htm#fnB1552"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:1)  The verb "take up" means "to utter, to repeat"; it was also used in the prohibition against taking "the name of Yahweh in vain."<br>

 <a name="fn1555" href="exo.htm#fnB1555"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:1)  The "wicked" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">uv*r*</FONT> [<i>rasa'</i>]) is a word that refers to the guilty criminal, the person who is doing something wrong. In the religious setting it describes the person who is not a member of the covenant, and may actually be involved in all kinds of sin, even though there is the appearance of moral and spiritual stability.<br>
 <a name="fn1556" href="exo.htm#fnB1556"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:1)  <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">sm*j*</FONT> (<i>hamas</i>) often means "violence" in the sense of social injustices done to other people, usually the poor and needy. A "malicious" witness would do great harm to others. See J. W. McKay, "Exodus 23:1-43, 6-8: A Decalogue for Administration of Justice in the City Gate," <i>VT</i> 21 (1971): 311-25.<br>
 <a name="fn1557" href="exo.htm#fnB1557"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:2)  The word is "to evil things," but it meas "to act wickedly." Joining to a crowd that is bent on such violence would be a violation of the Law.<br>
 <a name="fn1558" href="exo.htm#fnB1558"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:2)  The form is the Qal infinitive construct from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hFn</FONT> (<i>nata</i>); the same verb is used at the end of the sentence but as a Hiphil infinitive construct, "to perfect justice." <br>
 <a name="fn1559" href="exo.htm#fnB1559"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:3)  The point here is one of false sympathy and honor, the bad sense of the word (see Driver, p. 237). <br>

 <a name="fn1563" href="exo.htm#fnB1563"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:5)  The law is emphatic here as well, using the infinitive absolute and the imperfect of instruction (or possibly obligation). There is also a word play here: two words <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bzu</FONT> (<i>`azab</i>) are used, one meaning "forsake" and the other possibly meaning "arrange" based on Arabic and Ugaritic evidence (see Cassuto, 297,8).

A number of English versions therefore render this phrase "Lord GOD," and that convention has been followed here.<br>
 <a name="fn1593" href="exo.htm#fnB1593"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:18)  The verb is<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> jB^z+T!</FONT> (<i>tizbah</i>), the imperfect tense from the same root as the genitive that qualifies the accusative: "you will not sacrifice the blood of my sacrifice." The verb means "to slaughter"; since one cannot slaughter blood, a more general translation is required here. But if we explain the genitive with Cassuto as "my blood-sacrifice" (a genitive of specification; like "the evil of your doings" in Isa 1:16), then a translation of sacrifice would work (p. 304). <br>
 <a name="fn1594" href="exo.htm#fnB1594"><sup>44</sup></a><b>sn</b> (23:18)  See N. Snaith, "Exodus 23:18 and 34:25," <i>JTS</i> 20 (1969): 533-34; see also M. Haran, "The Passover Sacrifice," in <i>Studies in the Religion of Ancient Israel</i> (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1972), 86-116.<br>
 <a name="fn1595" href="exo.htm#fnB1595"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:19)  Cassuto reminds the readers that Maimonides centuries ago said that this law was intended to keep Israelites away from idolatrous practices. Then he cites the recently discovered Ugaritic tablet on "The gods pleasant and beautiful," text 52, line 14, where it is written "boil a kid in milk, a lamb in butter." The words "kid in milk" are the same as the Hebrew words in Exodus, but it does not say that this is the mother's milk. See C. M. Carmichael, "On Separating Life and Death: An Explanation of Some Biblical Laws," <i>HTR</i> 69 (1976): 1-7; J. Milgrom, "You Shall Not Boil a Kid In Its Mother's Milk," <i>BRev</i> 1 (1985): 48-55; R. J. Ratner and B.

 <a name="fn1596" href="exo.htm#fnB1596"><sup>46</sup></a><b>sn</b> (23:20)  This passage has some of the most interesting and perplexing expressions and constructions in the book. It is largely promise; but it is part of the Law and so demands compliance by faith. Its points are: God promises to send his Angelo to prepare the way before his obedient servants (20-23); God promises blessing for his loyal servants (24-33). So in the section one learns that God promises his protection (victory) and blessing (through his Angel) for his obedient and loyal worshipers. <br>
 <a name="fn1597" href="exo.htm#fnB1597"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:20)  The construction uses the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hN@h!</FONT> (<i>hinneh</i>) before the active participle, to indicate imminent future, something God is about to do. <br>
 <a name="fn1598" href="exo.htm#fnB1598"><sup>48</sup></a><b>sn</b> (23:20)  The word is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Ea*l=m^</FONT> (<i>mal'ak</i>), "messenger, angel." This angel is to be treated with the sam fear and respect as Yahweh, for Yahweh will be speaking in him. Cassuto says that the words of the first clause do not imply a being distinct from God, for in the ancient world the line of demarcation between the sender and the sent is liable easily to be blurred. Cassuto then shows how the "Angel of Yahweh" in Genesis is Yahweh . He concludes that the words here mean "I will guide you" (pp. 305-6). Christian commentators tend to identify the Angel of Yahweh as the second person of the Trinity (Kaiser, p. 446; and Kaiser, <i>Old Testament Theology,</i> p. 120). However, in addition to being a preincarnate appearance, the word could refer to Yahweh--some manifestation of Yahweh himself.<br>
 <a name="fn1599" href="exo.htm#fnB1599"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:20)  The form is the Hiphil<i> </i>perfect of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/WK</FONT> (<i>kun</i>), "to establish, prepare." <br>
 <a name="fn1600" href="exo.htm#fnB1600"><sup>50</sup></a><b>sn</b> (23:21)  The warning is "take heed," meaning, guard yourself, watch yourself. So, just as the Angel is coming to guard you, you are to guard yourself against disobeying him. <br>
 <a name="fn1601" href="exo.htm#fnB1601"><sup>51</sup></a><b>sn</b> (23:21)  This means "the manifestation of my being" is in him (Driver, p. 247). Driver then quotes McNeile as saying, "The `angel' is Jehovah Himself `in a temporary descent to visibility for a special purpose'." The Talmud identified the Angel as "Metatron," who stood nearest the throne of God.<br>
 <a name="fn1602" href="exo.htm#fnB1602"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:22)  The infinitive absolute here does not add as great an emphasis as normal, but emphasizes the condition that is being set forth (see again GKC &#167;113.<i>o</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn1603" href="exo.htm#fnB1603"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:24)  The Hebrew is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;h#yt@b)X@m^</FONT> (<i>massebotehem</i>), "their standing stones"; these long stones were erected to represent the abode of the numen or deity. They were usually set up near the altar or the high place. To destroy these would be to destroy the center of Canaanite worship in the land. <br>
 <a name="fn1604" href="exo.htm#fnB1604"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:24)  Both verbs are joined with their infinitive absolutes to provide the strongest sense to these instructions. The images of the false gods in Canaan were to be completely and utterly destroyed. This could not be said any stronger.<br>
 <a name="fn1605" href="exo.htm#fnB1605"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:25)  This is the perfect tense, masculine plural, with the <i>vav</i> consecutive; it is in sequence to the preceding: do not bow down to them, but serve Yahweh. It is then the equivalent of an imperfect of instruction or injunction.<br>
 <a name="fn1606" href="exo.htm#fnB1606"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:25)  The LXX reads "and I will bless" to make the verb conform with the speaker, Yahweh.<br>
 <a name="fn1607" href="exo.htm#fnB1607"><sup>57</sup></a><b>sn</b> (23:25)  On this unusual clause Jacob says that it is the reversal of the curse in Genesis, because the "bread and water" represent the field work and ground suitability for abundant blessing of provisions (p. 734). <br>
 <a name="fn1608" href="exo.htm#fnB1608"><sup>58</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:26)  Or "abort"; <i>Heb</i> "cast."<br>
 <a name="fn1609" href="exo.htm#fnB1609"><sup>59</sup></a><b>sn</b> (23:26)  No one will die prematurely; this applies to the individual or the nation. The plan of God to bless was grand, if the people would obey. <br>
 <a name="fn1610" href="exo.htm#fnB1610"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:27)  The word for "terror" is<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> yt!m*ya@</FONT> (<i>`emati</i>); the word has more the meaning "panic" or "dread." As the Israelites advanced God would make the nations panic as they heard of the exploits and new the new nation was drawing near. Cassuto thinks the reference to "hornets" in v. 28 may be a reference to this fear, an unreasoning dread, rather than to another insect invasion (p. 308). Others suggest it is symbolical of an invading army, or a country like Egypt, or literal insects (see E. Neufeld, "Insects as Warfare Agents in the Ancient Near East," <i>Or</i> 49 [1980]: 30-57).<br>
 <a name="fn1611" href="exo.htm#fnB1611"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:27)  <i>Heb</i> "kill."<br>
 <a name="fn1612" href="exo.htm#fnB1612"><sup>62</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:27)  The text has "and I will give all your enemies to you [as] a back." The verb of making takes two accusatives, the second being the adverbial accusative of product (see GKC &#167;117.<i>ii</i>, note).<br>
 <a name="fn1613" href="exo.htm#fnB1613"><sup>63</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:28)  <i>Heb</i> "and I will send."<br>
 <a name="fn1614" href="exo.htm#fnB1614"><sup>64</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:29)  <i>Heb</i> "the beast of the field."<br>
 <a name="fn1615" href="exo.htm#fnB1615"><sup>65</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:30)  The repetition expresses an exceptional or super fine quality (see GKC &#167;123.<i>e</i>). <br>

 <a name="fn1618" href="exo.htm#fnB1618"><sup>68</sup></a><b>sn</b> (23:31)  In the Hebrew Bible "the River" usually refers to the Euphrates. There is some thought that it refers to a river Nahr el Kebir between Lebanon and Syria. See further Kaiser, p. 447; and G. W. Buchanan, <i>The Consequences of the Covenant </i>(Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1970), pp 91-100.<i> </i><br>
 <a name="fn1619" href="exo.htm#fnB1619"><sup>69</sup></a><b>tn</b> (23:33)  The idea of the "snare" is to lure them to judgment; God is apparently warning about intercourse with the Canaanites, either in worship or in business. They are very syncretistic, and so it would be dangerous to settle among them.<br>
 <a name="fn1620" href="exo.htm#fnB1620"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (24:1)  Exod 24 is the highlight of the book in many ways; but most importantly, here Yahweh cuts the covenant with the people to inaugurate the Sinaitic Covenant. The unit not only serves to record the event in Israel's becoming a nation, but ti provides a paradigm of the worship of God's covenant people--entering into the presence of the glory of Yahweh. See additionally W. A. Maier, "The Analysis of Exodus 24 According to Modern Literary, Form, and Redaction Critical Methodology," <i>Springfielder</i> 37 (1973): 35-52. The passage may be divided into four parts for exposition: vv. 1-2 record the call for worship, vv. 3-8 record the consecration of the worshipers, vv. 9-11 record the confirmation of the covenant, and vv. 12-18 record the communication with Yahweh. <br>
 <a name="fn1621" href="exo.htm#fnB1621"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:1)  <i>Heb </i>"And he;" the referent (the LORD) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn1622" href="exo.htm#fnB1622"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (24:1)  They were to come up to the LORD after they had made the preparations that are found in vv. 3-8. <br>
 <a name="fn1623" href="exo.htm#fnB1623"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (24:1)  These seventy-four people were to go up the mountain to a certain point. Then they were to prostrate themselves and worship Yahweh as Moses went further up into the presence of Yahweh. Moses occupies the lofty position of mediator (as Christ in the NT), for he alone ascends "to Yahweh" while everyone waits for his return. The emphasis of "bowing down" and that from "far off" stresses again the ominous presence that was on the mountain. This was the holy God--only the designated mediator could draw near to him. <br>
 <a name="fn1624" href="exo.htm#fnB1624"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:2)  <i>Heb</i> "and...will approach."<br>
 <a name="fn1625" href="exo.htm#fnB1625"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:2)  The verb is the perfect tense with a <i>vav</i> consecutive; it and the preceding perfect tense follow the imperative, and so have either a force of instruction, or, as taken here, is the equivalent of an imperfect tense (of permission). <br>
 <a name="fn1626" href="exo.htm#fnB1626"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:2)  <i>Heb</i> "they."<br>
 <a name="fn1627" href="exo.htm#fnB1627"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:2)  Now the imperfect tense negated is used; here the prohibition would fit ("they will not come near"), or the obligatory ("they must not") in which the subjects are obliged to act--or not act in this case.<br>
 <a name="fn1628" href="exo.htm#fnB1628"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (24:3)  The general consensus among commentators is that this refers to Moses' coming from the mountain after he made the ascent in 20:21. Here he came and told them the laws (written in 20:22-23:33), and of the call to come up to Yahweh. <br>
 <a name="fn1629" href="exo.htm#fnB1629"><sup>10</sup></a><b>sn</b> (24:3)  The Decalogue may not be included here because the people had heard those commands themselves earlier. <br>

 <a name="fn1631" href="exo.htm#fnB1631"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:3)  The text simply has "one voice" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dj*a# loq</FONT> [<i>qol `ehad</i>]); this is an adverbial accusative of manner, telling how the people answered-- "<i>in</i> one voice," or unanimously (see GKC &#167;118.<i>q</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn1632" href="exo.htm#fnB1632"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:3)  The verb is the imperfect tense (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hC#u&amp;n~</FONT> [<i>na'aseh</i>]), although the form could be classified as a cohortative. If the latter, they would be saying that they are resolved to do what God said. If it is an imperfect, then the desiderative would make the most sense: "we are willing to do." They are not presumptuously saying the are going to do all these things. <br>
 <a name="fn1633" href="exo.htm#fnB1633"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:4)  The two preterites quite likely form a verbal hendiadys (the verb "to get up early" is frequently in such constructions). Literally it says, "and he got up early [in the morning] and he built"; this means "early [in the morning] he built." The first verb becomes the adverb. <br>
 <a name="fn1634" href="exo.htm#fnB1634"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:4)  "under."<br>
 <a name="fn1635" href="exo.htm#fnB1635"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:4)  The thing numbered is found in the singular when the number is plural-- "twelve standing-stone." See GKC &#167;134.<i>f</i>. The "standing-stone" could be a small piece about a foot high, or a huge column higher than men. They served to commemorate treaties (Gen 32), or visions (Gen 28) or boundaries, or graves. Here it will function with the altar as a place of worship.<br>
 <a name="fn1636" href="exo.htm#fnB1636"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:5)  The construct has "young men of the Israelites"; and so "Israelite" is a genitive that describes them.<br>
 <a name="fn1637" href="exo.htm#fnB1637"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:5)  The verbs and their respective accusatives are cognates. First, they offered up burnt offerings (see Lev. 1), which is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tOu) Wlu&amp;Y~w~</FONT> (<i>wayya'alu `olot</i>); then they sacrificed young bulls as peace sacrifices (Lev. 3), which is in Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yj!b*z+ WjB=z+Y]w~</FONT> (<i>wayyizb<sup>e</sup>hu z<sup>e</sup>bahim</i>). In the first case the cognate accusative is the direct object; in the second it is an adverbial accusative of product. See on this covenant ritual H. M. Kamsler, "The Blood Covenant in the Bible," <i>Dor l<sup>e</sup> Dor</i> 6 (1977): 94-98; E. W. Nicholson, "The Covenant Ritual in Exodus 24:3-8," <i>VT</i> 32 (1982): 74-86.<br>
 <a name="fn1638" href="exo.htm#fnB1638"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (24:6)  The people and Yahweh through this will be united by blood, for half was dashed against the altar and the other half sprinkled over/towards the people (v. 8). <br>
 <a name="fn1639" href="exo.htm#fnB1639"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:7)  The noun "book" would be the scroll just written containing the laws of chaps. 20-23. On the basis of this scroll the covenant would be concluded here. The reading of this book would assure the people that it was the same that they had agreed to earlier. But now their statement of willingness to obey would be more binding, because their promise would be by a covenant of blood. <br>
 <a name="fn1640" href="exo.htm#fnB1640"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:7)  <i>Heb</i> "ears of."<br>
 <a name="fn1641" href="exo.htm#fnB1641"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:7)  A second verb is now added to the people's response, and it is clearly an imperfect and not a cohortative, lending support for the choice of desiderative imperfect in these commitments-- "we want to obey." This was their compliance with the covenant.<br>
 <a name="fn1642" href="exo.htm#fnB1642"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:8)  Given the size of the congregation, the preposition might be rendered here "toward the people" rather than on them (all).<br>
 <a name="fn1643" href="exo.htm#fnB1643"><sup>24</sup></a><b>sn</b> (24:8)  The construct relationship "the blood of the covenant" means "the blood by which the covenant is ratified" (Driver, p. 254). The parallel with the inauguration of the new covenant in the blood of Christ is striking: "The is the blood of the new covenant" (Matt 26:28, 1 Cor 11:25). When Jesus was inaugurating the new covenant, he was bringing to an end the old. <br>

 <a name="fn1645" href="exo.htm#fnB1645"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (24:10)  Driver wishes to safeguard the traditional idea that God could not be seen by reading "they saw the place where the God of Israel stood" (p. 254) so as not to say they saw God. But according to Cassuto there is not a great deal of difference between "and they saw the God" and "the LORD God appeared" (p. 314). Cassuto thinks that the word "God" is used instead of "Yahweh" to say that a divine phenomenon was seen. It is in the LXX that they add "the place where he stood." In verse 11b the LXX has "and they appeared in the place of God." See James Barr, "Theophany and Anthropomorphism in the Old Testament," VTSup 7 (1959): 31-33. There is no detailed description here of what they saw, anymore than what Isaiah (6) saw, or Ezekiel (l) saw. But the NT in John 12 indicates that this may have been a pre-incarnate appearance of the second person.<br>

The LXX safeguarded this by saying, "appeared in the place of God." Jacob says they beheld--prophetically, religiously (p. 746)--but the meaning of that is unclear. The fact that God did not lay a hand on them--to kill them--shows that they saw something that they never expected to see and live. Some Christian interpreters have taken this to refer to a glorious appearance of the preincarnate Christ, the second person of the Trinity. They saw the brilliance of this manifestation--but not the detail. Later, Moses will still ask to see his glory--the real presence behind the phenomena.<br>

From this is derived the epithet, "the Shekinah Glory," the dwelling or abiding glory. First there is the descending to the mountain, and then there is the abiding. The "glory of Yahweh" was a phenomenon visible at a distance, clearly in view of the Israelites. To them it was like a consuming fire in the midst of the cloud that covered the mountain. That fire indicated that Yahweh wished to accept their sacrifice, as if it was a pleasant aroma to him, as Leviticus would say. This "appearance" indicated that the phenomena represented a shimmer of the likeness of his glory (Jacob, p. 749). The verb according to Cassuto (see p. 316) also gives us an inkling of the next section of the book, the building of the "tabernacle," the dwelling place, the <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/K*v=m!</FONT> (<i>miskan</i>). The vision of the glory of Yahweh confirmed the authority of the revelation of the Law given to Israel. This chapter is the climax of God's bringing people into covenant with , the completion of his revelation to them, a completion that is authenticated with the miraculous. It ends with the mediator going up in the clouds to be with God, and the people down below eagerly awaiting his return. The message of the whole chapter could be worded this way: Those whom God sanctifies by the blood of the covenant and instructs by the book of the covenant may enjoy fellowship with him and anticipate a far more glorious fellowship. So too in the NT the commandments and teachings of Jesus are confirmed by his miraculous deeds, and by his glorious manifestation on the Mount of the Transfiguration, where a few who represented the disciples would see his glory, and be able to teach others. The people of the new covenant have been brought into fellowship with God through the blood of the covenant; they wait eagerly for his return from heaven in the clouds of the air. <br>

He did not rise to heaven--the ground remained firmly under his feet. But he clearly was brought into God's presence; he was like a heavenly servant before God's throne, like the angels, and he consumed neither bread of water. The purpose of his being there was to become familiar with all God's demands and purposes. He would receive the tablets of stone, and all the instruction of the tabernacle that was to be built (beginning now in chap. 25). He would not descend now until the sin of the golden calf.<br>

The first paragraph introduces the issue of the heavenly pattern for the construction, and then calls for the people to make willing offerings (vv. 2-7) and explains the purpose for these offerings (vv. 8, 9). The message here is that God calls his people to offer of their substance willingly so that his sanctuary may be made. <br>

There is some question about the etymology of the word. The traditional meaning of "heave-offering" derives from the idea of "elevation," a root meaning "to be high" lying behind the word. Jacob says it is something sorted out of a mass of material and designated for a higher purpose (p. 765). Driver corrects the idea of "heave-offering" by relating the root to the Hiphil<i> </i>form of that root, <i>herim</i>, "to lift" or "take off." He suggests the noun means "what is taken off" from a larger mass and so designated for sacred purposes (p. 263). The LXX has "something taken off." <br>

The powder made from the dried maggots produces the bright red-yellow color (Kaiser, p. 452). Jacob takes the view that these are not simply colors that are being introduced here, but fabrics dyed with these colors (p. 765). Driver thinks it refers to yarn that has been dyed, but not yet spun into fabric. At any rate, the sequence would then be metals, fabrics, two objects for the tabernacle and two objects for the priests. <br>

Cassuto reminds the reader that God did not need a place to dwell, but the Israelites needed a dwelling place for him, so that they would look to it and be reminded that he was in their midst (p. 327).<br>
 <a name="fn1682" href="exo.htm#fnB1682"><sup>16</sup></a><b>sn</b> (25:9)  The expression "the pattern of the tabernacle" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/K*v=M!h^ tyn]b=T^</FONT> [<i>tabnit hammiskan</i>]) has been the source of much exegetical inquiry. The word "pattern" comes from the verb "to build"; it suggests a model. Driver notes that in ancient literature there is the account of Gudea receiving in a dream a complete model of a temple he was to erect (p. 267). In this passage Moses is being shown something on the mountain that should be the pattern of the earthly sanctuary. The most plausible explanation of what he was shown comes from a correlation with the comments in the Letter to the Hebrews and the Book of Revelation, which describe the heavenly sanctuary as the true sanctuary, and the earthly as the copy or shadow. One could say that Moses was allowed to see what John saw on the island of Patmos, a vision of the heavenly sanctuary. That still might not explain what it was, but it would mean he saw a revelation of the true tent, and that would imply that he learned of the spiritual and eternal significance of all of it. The fact that Israel's sanctuary resembled those of other cultures does not nullify this act of revelation; rather, it raises the question as to where the other nations got their ideas if it was not made known early in human history. One can conclude that in the beginning there was much more revealed to the parents in the garden than Scripture tells us (Cain and Abel did know how to make sacrifices before Leviticus legislated it). Likewise, one cannot but guess at the influence of the fallen Satan and his angels in the world of pagan religion. Whatever the source, at Sinai God shows the true, and instructs that it all be done without the pagan corruptions and additions. Cassuto notes that the fact that there are these ancient parallels shows that the section on the tabernacle need not be dated later into the second temple period, but fits the earlier period very well (p. 324). <br>

Verses 10-15 provide the instructions for it, v. 16 has the putting of the Law into it, vv. 17-21 cover the mercy lid, and v. 22 the meeting above it. The point of this article in the tabernacle is to underscore the focus: the covenant people must always have God's holy standard before them as they draw near to worship. A study of this would focus on God's nature (he is a God of order, precision, and perfection), on the usefulness of this for worship, and on the typology intended.<br>

 <a name="fn1691" href="exo.htm#fnB1691"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:17)  The noun is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tr#P)K^</FONT> (<i>kapporet</i>), a "propitiatory." The old translation of "mercy-seat" came from Tyndale in 1530 and was also used by Luther in 1523. The noun is formed from the word "to make atonement," and here means "a propitiating thing," or "means of propitiation" or "place of propitiation." The translation of "covering" is probably incorrect, for it derives from a rare use of the verb, if the same verb at all (the evidence shows "cover" is from another root with the same letters as this). The value of this place was that Yahweh sat enthroned above it, and so the ark essentially was the "footstool." Blood was applied to the lid of the box, for that was the place of atonement (see Driver, 269-270).<br>
 <a name="fn1692" href="exo.htm#fnB1692"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:17)  After verbs of making or producing, the accusative (like "gold" here) may be used to express the material from which something is made (see GKC &#167;117.<i>hh</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn1693" href="exo.htm#fnB1693"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:18)  The evidence suggests that the cherubim were composite angelic creatures that always indicated the nearness of God. So here images of them were to be crafted and put on each end of the ark of the covenant to signify that they were there. Ezekiel 1 describes four cherubim as each having human faces, four wings, and parts of different animals for their bodies. Traditions of them appear in the other cultures as well. They serve to guard the holy places and to bear the throne of God. Here they were to be beaten out as part of the lid. <br>

 <a name="fn1697" href="exo.htm#fnB1697"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:20)  The verb means "overshadowing, screening" in the sense of guarding (see 1 Kgs 8:7; 1 Chr 28:18; see also the account in Gen 3:24). The cherubim then signify two things here: by their outstretched wings they form the throne of God who sits above the ark (with the Law under his feet), and by their overshadowing and guarding they signify this as the place of atonement where people must find propitiation to commune with God. Until then they are barred from his presence. See Cassuto, 330-335.<br>

 <a name="fn1700" href="exo.htm#fnB1700"><sup>34</sup></a><b>sn</b> (25:22)  Here then is the main point of the ark of the covenant, and the main point of all worship--meeting with God through atonement. The text makes it clear that here God would meet with Moses ("you" is singular) and then he would speak to the people--he is the mediator of the covenant. Driver (p. 272) makes the point that the verb here is not the word that means "to meet by chance" (as in Exod 3:18), but "to meet" by appointment for a purpose (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yT!d=u^onw+</FONT> [<i>w<sup>e</sup>no'adti</i>]). The parallel in the NT is Jesus Christ and his work. The theology is that the Law condemns us of sin, but the sacrifice of Christ makes atonement. So he is the "place of propitiation (Rom 3:25) who gains communion with the Father for us. A major point that could be made from this section is this: At the center of worship (we go to commune with God through Christ) must be the atoning work of Christ--a perpetual reminder of God's righteous standard (the testimony in the ark) and God's gracious provision (the propitiatory lid). <br>
 <a name="fn1701" href="exo.htm#fnB1701"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:22)  The verb is placed here in the text: "and I will speak"; it has been moved in this translation to be closer to the direct object clause. <br>

It was called the "presence-bread" because it was set out in his presence. The theology of this is that God provides; and the practice of this is that the people must provide for constant thanks. So if the ark spoke of communion through propitiation, the table speaks of dedicatory gratitude. <br>

The noun "the table" is introduced by what looks like the sign of the accusative, but here it serves to introduce or emphasize the nominative (see GKC &#167;117.<i>i</i>).<br>

The custom is that of presenting bread on a table to God as a thank offering is common in other cultures as well. The bread here, though, would be placed on the table as a symbol for the divine provision for the twelve tribes--continually, because they were to express their thanksgiving continually. Priests could eat the bread after certain times. Fresh bread would be put there regularly.<br>
 <a name="fn1714" href="exo.htm#fnB1714"><sup>48</sup></a><b>sn</b> (25:31)  Clearly the point here is to provide light in the tent for access to Yahweh. God provided for his worshipers a light to the way to God; but then he also wanted them to provide light for the lamp to ensure that the light would not go out. Verses 31-36 describe the piece. It was essentially one central shaft, with three branches on either side turned out and upward. The stem and the branches were ornamented every so often with gold which was formed into the shape of the calyx and corolla of the almond flower. On top of the central shaft and the six branches were the lamps. <br>

 <a name="fn1727" href="exo.htm#fnB1727"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:37)  The word for "lamps" is from the same root as the lampstand, of course. The word is<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew"> torn@</FONT> (<i>nerot</i>). This probably refers to the small saucer-like pottery lamps that are made very simply with the rim pinched over to form a place to lay the wick. The bowl is then filled with olive oil as fuel.<br>
 <a name="fn1728" href="exo.htm#fnB1728"><sup>62</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:37)  The translation "put up on" is the verb "bring up." The construction is impersonal, "and he will bring up," meaning "one will bring up." It may mean that people were to fix the lamps on to the shaft and the branches, rather than cause the light to go up (see Driver, p. 277).<br>
 <a name="fn1729" href="exo.htm#fnB1729"><sup>63</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:37)  This is the verb, the Hiphil perfect with the <i>vav</i> consecutive, from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">roa</FONT>, "light," and in the causative, "to light, give light."<br>
 <a name="fn1730" href="exo.htm#fnB1730"><sup>64</sup></a><b>sn</b> (25:38)  The first word refers to something like small tongs or tweezers used to pull up and trim the wicks; the second word refers to fire-pans or censers. <br>

 <a name="fn1734" href="exo.htm#fnB1734"><sup>68</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:40)  The text uses two imperatives: "see and make." This can be interpreted as a verbal hendiadys, calling for Moses and Israel to see to it that they make these things correctly.<br>
 <a name="fn1735" href="exo.htm#fnB1735"><sup>69</sup></a><b>tn</b> (25:40)  The participle is passive, "caused to see," or, "shown."<br>
 <a name="fn1736" href="exo.htm#fnB1736"><sup>70</sup></a><b>sn</b> (25:40)  The message of this section surely refers to the light which shows the way or access to God. If one is to expound this correctly, though, since it is an instruction section for building the lampstand the message would be: God requires that his people ensure that light will guide the way of access to God. The breakdown for exposition could be the instructions for preparation for light (one lamp, several branches), then instructions for the purpose and maintenance of the lamps, and then the last verse telling the divine source for the instructions. Naturally, the metaphorical value of light will come up in the study, especially from the NT. So in the NT there is the warning that if churches are unfaithful God will remove their lampstand, their ministry (Rev 2-3). <br>
 <a name="fn1737" href="exo.htm#fnB1737"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (26:1)  This chapter is given over to the details of the structure itself, the curtains, coverings, boards and walls and veil. The passage can be studied on one level for its function both practically and symbolically for Israel's worship. On another level it can be studied for its typology, for the tabernacle and many of its parts speak of Christ. For this one should see the commentaries. <br>
 <a name="fn1738" href="exo.htm#fnB1738"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:1)  The word order thrusts this to the front for particular emphasis. After the first couple of pieces of furniture are treated (chap. 25), the subject turns to the tabernacle itself.<br>
 <a name="fn1739" href="exo.htm#fnB1739"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:1)  This is for the adverbial accusative explaining how the dwelling place is to be made.<br>
 <a name="fn1740" href="exo.htm#fnB1740"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (26:1)  Driver suggests that the curtains were made of with threads dyed with these colors (p. 280). Perhaps the colored threads were used for embroidering the cherubim in the curtains. <br>
 <a name="fn1741" href="exo.htm#fnB1741"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:1)  The construction is difficult in this line because of the word order. "Cherubim" is an adverbial accusative explaining how they were to make the curtains. And <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bv@j) hC@u&amp;m^</FONT> (<i>ma'aseh hoseb</i>) means literally "the work of the designer"; it is in apposition to "cherubim." The Hebrew participle means "designer" or "deviser" so that one could render this "of artistic designs in weaving" (Driver, 280-81). Jacob says that it refers to "artistic weavers" (p. 789). The line reads: "You will make them...[with] cherubim, the work of the artistic designer."<br>
 <a name="fn1742" href="exo.htm#fnB1742"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:2)  <i>Heb</i> "one."<br>

 <a name="fn1744" href="exo.htm#fnB1744"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:3)  This is the active participle, not the passive. It would normally be rendered "joining together." The Bible uses the active because it has the result of the sewing in mind, namely, that every curtain accompanies another (Cassuto, p. 348).<br>
 <a name="fn1745" href="exo.htm#fnB1745"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:3)  <i>Heb</i> "a woman to her sister," this form of using nouns to express "one to another" is selected because "curtains" is a feminine noun (see GKC &#167;139.<i>e</i>).<br>

 <a name="fn1750" href="exo.htm#fnB1750"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (26:7)  This chapter will show that there were two sets of curtains and two sets of coverings that went over the wood building to make the tabernacle or dwelling place. From inside the curtains of fine linen described above could only be seen by the priests. Above that will be the curtain of goats' hair. Then, over that were the coverings, an inner covering of rams' skins dyed red, and an outer covering of hides of sea cows. The movement is from the inside to the outside because it is God's dwelling place; the approach of the worshiper would be the opposite. The pure linen represented the righteousness of God, guarded by the embroidered cherubim; the curtain of goats' hair was a reminder of sin through the daily sin offering of a goat; the covering of rams' skins dyed red was a reminder of the sacrifice, and the priestly ministry set apart by blood; and the outer covering marked the separation between God and the world. These are the interpretations set forth by Kaiser; others vary, but not greatly (p. 459). <br>

If it refers to boards, then it is difficult to understand how the tabernacle can be called a "tent." The literature on this includes: M.

 <a name="fn1773" href="exo.htm#fnB1773"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (26:31)  This could be translated "curtain" but it is a different word. The etymology of the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tk#r)p*</FONT> (<i>paroket</i>) seems to be connected with a verb that means "to shut off" and was used with a shrine.

 <a name="fn1783" href="exo.htm#fnB1783"><sup>47</sup></a><b>sn</b> (26:37)  In all the details of this chapter the expositor should pay attention to the overall message rather than engage in speculation concerning the symbolism of the details. It is, after all, the divine instruction for the preparation of the dwelling place for Yahweh. The point could be said this way: The dwelling place of Yahweh must be prepared in accordance with, and by the power of, his divine word. If God was to fellowship with his people, then the center of worship had to be made to his specifications, which were in harmony with his nature. Everything was functional for the approach to God through the ritual by divine provisions. But everything also reflected the nature of God, the symmetry, the order, the pure wood, the gold overlay, or (closer to God) the solid gold. And th symbolism of the light, the table, the veil, the cherubim--all of it was revelatory. All of it reflected the reality in heaven. Churches today do not retain the pattern and furnishings of the old tabernacle. However, they would do well to learn what God was requiring of Israel, so that their structures are planned in accordance with the theology of worship and the theology of access to God. Function is a big part; but symbolism and revelation instruct the planning and use of everything to be used. We live in the light of the fulfillment of Christ, and so we know the realities that the old foreshadowed. While a building is not necessary for worship (just as Israel worshiped in places beside the sanctuary), it is practical, and if there is going to be one, then the most should be made of it in the teaching and worshiping of the assembly. This chapter, then, provides an inspiration for believers on preparing a functional, symbolical, ordered place of worship that is in harmony with the word of God. And there is much to be said for making it as beautiful and uplifting as is possible--as a gift of freewill offering to God. Of course, the most important part of preparing a place of worship is the preparing of the heart. Worship, to be acceptable to God, must be in Christ. He said that when the temple was destroyed he would raise it up in three days. While he referred to his own body, he also alluded to the temple by the figure. When they put Jesus to death, they were destroying the temple; at his resurrection he would indeed begin a new form of worship. He is the tent, the veil, the propitiatory, that the sanctuary foreshadowed. And then, believers also when they receive Christ, become the temple of the Lord. So the NT will take the imagery and teaching of this chapter in a number of useful ways, that call for more study. <br>

 <b>sn</b> (27:8)  Nothing is said about the top of the altar. Some commentators suggest, in view of the previous instruction for making an altar out of earth and stone, that when this one was to be used it would be filled up with dirt clods and the animal burnt on the top of that. If the animal was burnt inside it, the wood would quickly burn. A number of recent scholars think this was simply an imagined plan to make a portable altar after the pattern of Solomon's--but that is an unsatisfactory suggestion. This construction must simply represent a portable frame for the altar in the courtyard, an improvement over the field altar. But the purpose and function of the altar are not in question. Here worshipers would make their sacrifices to God in order to find forgiveness and atonement, and in order to celebrate in worship with him. No one could worship God apart from this; no one could approach God apart from this. So too the truths that this altar communicated form the basis and center of all Christian worship. We could word an applicable lesson this way: Believers must ensure that the foundation and center of their worship is the altar, i.e., the sacrificial atonement. <br>

But it is an important aspect of OT theology. The writer's pattern so far has been: ark, table, lamp and then their contained (the tabernacle); then the altar, and its container (the courtyard). The courtyard is the place of worship where the people could gather--they entered his courts. If the courtyard does not interest us very much, it did the Israelites. Here the sacrifices were made, the choirs sang, the believers offered their praises, they had their sins forgiven, they came to pray, they appeared on the holy days, and they heard from God. It was sacred because God met them there; they left the "world" so to speak and came into his presence. When one enters a place where worship has been meaningful for ages, one knows that it is a special place.<br>

 <a name="fn1829" href="exo.htm#fnB1829"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (28:1)  Some modern scholars find this and the next chapter too elaborate for the wilderness experience. To most of them this reflects the later Zadokite priesthood of the writer's (P's) day, but was referred to Mosaic legislation for authentication. But there is no compelling reason why this should be late; it is put late because it is assumed to be P, and that is assumed to be late. But both assumptions are unwarranted. This lengthy chapter could be divided this way: instructions for preparing the garments (1-5), details of the apparel (6-39), and a warning against deviating from these (40-43). The subject matter of the first part is: God requires that his chosen ministers reflect his holy nature; the point of the second part is: God requires his ministers to be prepared to fulfill the tasks of the ministry; and the subject matter of the third part is: God warns all his ministers to safeguard the holiness of their service. <br>
 <a name="fn1830" href="exo.htm#fnB1830"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:1)  The verb is the Hiphil imperative of the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">brq</FONT> (<i>qarab</i>), "to draw near."

 <a name="fn1831" href="exo.htm#fnB1831"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:1)  This entire clause is a translation of the Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yl!-onh&amp;k^l=</FONT> (<i>l<sup>e</sup>kahano-li</i>), "that he might be a priest to me," but the form is unusual. The word means "to be a priest" or "to act as a priest." The etymology of the Hebrew word for priest, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/h@K)</FONT> (<i>kohen</i>), is uncertain. <br>
 <a name="fn1832" href="exo.htm#fnB1832"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (28:2)  The genitive "holy" is the attribute for "garments." The point of the word "holy" is that these garments would be distinctive from ordinary garments, for they set Aaron apart to sanctuary service and ministry. <br>
 <a name="fn1833" href="exo.htm#fnB1833"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:2)  The expression is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tr#ap=t!l=W dobk*l=</FONT> (<i>l<sup>e</sup>kabod u-l<sup>e</sup>tip'aret</i>), "for glory and for beauty." Kaiser, quoting the NIV's "to give him dignity and honor," says that these clothes were to exalt the office of the high priest as well as beautify the worship of God (which explains more of what the text has than the NIV rendering; see p. 465). The meaning of the word "glory" has much to do with the importance of the office, to be sure; but in Exodus the word has been used also for the brilliance of the presence of Yahweh, and so the magnificence of these garments might indeed strike the worshiper with the sense of the exaltation of the service. <br>

 <a name="fn1835" href="exo.htm#fnB1835"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:3)  The word for "wise" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ym@k=j^</FONT> [<i>hakme</i>], the plural construct form) is from the word group that is usually translated "wisdom, wise, be wise," but has as its basic meaning "skill" or "skillful." This is the way it is used in 31:3, 6 and 35;10 etc. God gave these people "wisdom" so that <i>they would know how to make these things</i>. The "heart" for the Hebrews is the locus of understanding, the mind and the will. To be "wise of heart" or "wise in heart" means that they had the understanding to do skillful work, they were talented artisans and artists.<br>
 <a name="fn1836" href="exo.htm#fnB1836"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:3)  There is no reason to take this as a reference to the Holy Spirit who produces wisdom in these people, although that is not totally impossible. The NIV did not even translate the word "spirit." It probably refers to their attitude and ability, as we would speak of people having a good spirit about them. Cassuto says, "to all the artisans skilled in the making of stately robes, in the heart [i.e., mind] of each of whom I have implanted sagacity in his craft so that he may do his craft successfully" (p. 371). <br>

 <a name="fn1840" href="exo.htm#fnB1840"><sup>12</sup></a><b>sn</b> (28:6)  The word "ephod" is taken over directly from the Hebrew, because no one knows how to translate it. It refers to a garment worn by the priests, but also it can refer to some kind of an image for a god (Judg 8:27), and in other places some kind of an object for consulting God (1 Sam 14:3). The ephod may have contained the urim and the thummim. In early Israel it certainly referred to a priestly garment, perhaps a linen loin cloth, or kilt-like skirt, after the fashion of Egyptian priests. It seems probable that it is a garment for the lower part of the body and attached to the breast piece above it (Hyatt, <i>Exodus</i>, 281-82). <br>

Since the entire ephod was of the same material, and this was of the same piece, it is unclear why this is singled out as "artistically woven." Perhaps it is from another toot that just describes it as a "band." Whatever the connection, this band was to be of the same material, and the same piece, as the ephod, but perhaps a different pattern (Driver, p. 301). It is this sash that attaches the ephod to the priest's body, that is, at the upper border of the ephod and clasped together at the back.<br>

Thus he was to enter the presence of God as the nation's representative, ever mindful of the nation's interests, and ever bringing the remembrance of it before God (Driver, p. 306). <br>

There is no clear evidence of their size, or shape, or the material of which they were made, but they seem to have been familiar descriptions to Moses and the people. The best example of their use comes from 1 Sam 14:36-42. Some have suggested that from the etymologies they were light and dark objects respectively, perhaps stones, or sticks, or some other object. They seem to have fallen out of use after the Davidic period when the prophetic oracles became popular. It may be that the title "pouch of judgment" indicates that these objects were used for making "decisions" (Hyatt, 283-84). Cassuto has the most thorough treatment of the subject (pp. 378-82); he lists several very clear rules for their uses gathered from their use in the Bible, including that they were a form of sacred lot, that priests or leaders of the people only could use them, and that they were used for discovering the divine will in areas that were beyond human ken. <br>

 <a name="fn1873" href="exo.htm#fnB1873"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:32)  The verb is the Niphal imperfect, here given the nuance of potential imperfect. Here it serves in a final clause (purpose/result), introduced only by the negative (see GKC &#167;165.<i>a</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn1874" href="exo.htm#fnB1874"><sup>46</sup></a><b>sn</b> (28:33)  This must mean round balls of yarn that looked like pomegranates. The fruit was very common in the land; but there is no indication of the reason for their choice here. They are found in decorative schemes in Ugarit, probably as signs of fertility. It may be that here they represent the blessing of God on Israel in the land. The bells that are between them possibly have the intent of drawing God's attentions as the priest moves and the bells jingle (anthropomorphic, to be sure), or that the people would know that the priest was still alive and moving inside. Some have suggested that the pomegranate may have recalled the forbidden fruit eaten in the garden (the gems already have referred to the garden), the reason for the priest entering for atonement, and the bells would divert the eye (of God) to remind him of the need. This is possible, but far from supportable since nothing is said of the reason, nor is the fruit in the garden identified. <br>
 <a name="fn1875" href="exo.htm#fnB1875"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:33)  The text repeats the idea: "you will make for its hem...all around its hem."<br>

 <a name="fn1878" href="exo.htm#fnB1878"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:35)  The form is the Piel infinitive construct with the <i>lamed</i> preposition, "to minister" or "to serve." It may be taken epexegetically here, "while serving," although Driver takes it as a purpose, "in order that he may minister" (p. 308). The point then would be that he dare not enter into the Holy Place without wearing it. <br>
 <a name="fn1879" href="exo.htm#fnB1879"><sup>51</sup></a><b>sn</b> (28:35)  In this verse it seems clearer that God would hear the bells, and be reminded that this priest was sin his presence representing the nation, and that he had followed the rules of the sanctuary with all the robes and their attachments. <br>
 <a name="fn1880" href="exo.htm#fnB1880"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:36)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">JyX!</FONT> (<i>sis</i>) seems to mean "a shining thing" and so here a plate of metal. It originally meant "flower," but they could not write on a flower. So it must have the sense of something worn openly, visible, and shining. The Rabbinic tradition says it was two fingers wide and stretched from ear to ear, but this is an attempt to give details that the Law does not give (see Jacob, p. 818). <br>
 <a name="fn1881" href="exo.htm#fnB1881"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:36)  The expression "the engravings of a seal" is an adverbial accusative of manner; "after the fashion of" is simply an attempt to express that.<br>
 <a name="fn1882" href="exo.htm#fnB1882"><sup>54</sup></a><b>sn</b> (28:36)  The engraving was a perpetual reminder of the holiness that was due the LORD (<i>Heb</i> "Yahweh"), how that all the clothing, the furnishings, and the activities were to come under that description. This corresponded to the symbolism for the whole nation of binding the law between the eyes. It was to be a perpetual reminder of commitment. <br>
 <a name="fn1883" href="exo.htm#fnB1883"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:37)  The verb is the perfect tense with the <i>vav</i> consecutive; it follows the same at the beginning of the verse. Since the first verb is equal to the imperfect of instruction, this could be as well, but it is more likely to be subordinated to express the purpose of the former.<br>
 <a name="fn1884" href="exo.htm#fnB1884"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:37)  <i>Heb</i> "it will be," an instruction imperfect.<br>
 <a name="fn1885" href="exo.htm#fnB1885"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:38)  The construction "the iniquity of the holy things" is difficult. "Holy things" is explained in the passage by all the gifts the people bring and consecrate to Yahweh. But there will inevitably be iniquity involved. Cassuto explains that Aaron "will atone for all the transgressions committed in connection with the order of the service, the purity of the consecrated things, or the use of the holy gifts, for the declaration engraved on the plate will prove that everything was intended to be <i>holy to the Lord,</i> and if aught was done irregularly, the intention at least was good" (p. 385).<br>
 <a name="fn1886" href="exo.htm#fnB1886"><sup>58</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:38)  The clause reads: "according to/by all the gifts of their holiness." The genitive is an attributive genitive, the suffix on it referring to the whole bound construction-- "their holy gifts." The idea of the line is that the people will consecrate as holy things gifts they bring to the sanctuary. <br>
 <a name="fn1887" href="exo.htm#fnB1887"><sup>59</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:38)  This clause is the infinitive construct with the <i>lamed</i> preposition, followed by the prepositional phrase: "for acceptance for them." This infinitive provides the purpose or result of the act of wearing the dedicatory frontlet--that they will be acceptable. <br>
 <a name="fn1888" href="exo.htm#fnB1888"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:39)  It is difficult to know how to translate <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">T*X=B^v!w+</FONT> (<i>w<sup>e</sup>sibbasta</i>); it is a Piel perfect with the <i>vav</i> consecutive, and so equal to the imperfect of instruction. But the root may have something of a check nature to it by alternate weaving of the threads. It may describe a quilted look, or embroidered. It was the work of the weaver (29:27) and so not as detailed as the others (26:1), but it was more than plain weaving (Driver, p. 310).<br>
 <a name="fn1889" href="exo.htm#fnB1889"><sup>61</sup></a><b>sn</b> (28:40)  This refers to a band of linen wrapped around the head, forming something like a brimless convex cap, resembling something like a half egg. It refers only to the head gear of ordinary priests (see Driver, 310,11).<br>
 <a name="fn1890" href="exo.htm#fnB1890"><sup>62</sup></a><b>sn</b> (28:41)  The instructions in this verse anticipate chap. 29, as well as the ordination ceremony described in Lev 8 and 9. The anointing of Aaron is specifically required in the Law, for he is to be the High Priest. The expression "consecrate them" might better be translated as "install them" or "ordain them"; it literally reads "and fill their hands," an expression for the consecration offering for priesthood in Lev 8:33). The final instruction to sanctify them will involve the ritual of the atoning sacrifices to make the priests acceptable in the sanctuary. <br>

 <a name="fn1893" href="exo.htm#fnB1893"><sup>65</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:43)  The construction for this temporal clause is the infinitive construct with the temporal preposition <i>bet</i> and the suffixed subjective genitive.<br>
 <a name="fn1894" href="exo.htm#fnB1894"><sup>66</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:43)  This construction is also the temporal clause with the infinitive construct and the temporal preposition <i>bet</i> and the suffixed subjective genitive.<br>

The imperfect tense here introduces a final clause, yielding a purpose or result translation ("in order that" or "so that"). The last verb is the perfect tense with the <i>vav</i> consecutive, and so it to is equal to a final imperfect--but it would show the result of bearing the iniquity. The idea is that if they approached the holy things with a lack of modesty, perhaps like the pagans who have nakedness and sexuality as part of the cultic ritual, they would pollute the holy things with earthy, physical things, and it would be reckoned to them for iniquity and they would die.<br>
 <a name="fn1896" href="exo.htm#fnB1896"><sup>68</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:43)  <i>Heb</i> "seed."<br>
 <a name="fn1897" href="exo.htm#fnB1897"><sup>69</sup></a><b>sn</b> (28:43)  So the priests were to make intercession for the people, give decisions from God's revealed will, enter his presence in purity, and represent holiness to Yahweh. The clothing of the priests provided for these functions, but in a way that brought honor and dignity. He was, therefore, to serve in purity, holiness, and fear (Malachi). There is much that can be derived from this chapter to form principles of spiritual leadership; but the overall point can be worded this way: Those whom God selects to minister to the congregation through intercessory prayer, divine counsel, and sacrificial worship, must always represent the holiness of Yahweh in their activities and demeanor. <br>
 <a name="fn1898" href="exo.htm#fnB1898"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (29:1)  Chap. 29 is a rather long, involved discussion of the consecration of Aaron the priest. It is similar to the ordination service in Lev 8. In fact, the execution of what is instructed here is narrated there. But these instructions must have been formulated after or in conjunction with Lev 1-7, for they presuppose a knowledge of the sacrifices. The bulk of the chapter is the consecration of the priests: 1-35. It has the preparation (1-3), washing (4), investiture and anointing (5-9), sin offering (10-14, burnt offering (15-18), installation peace offering (19-26, 31-34), other offerings' rulings (27-30), and the duration of the ritual (35). Then there is the consecration of the altar (36,37), and the oblations (38-46). There are many possibilities for the study and exposition of this material. The whole chapter is the consecration of tabernacle, altar, people, and most of all the priests. God was beginning the holy operations with sacral ritual. So the overall message would be: Everyone who ministers, everyone who worships, and everything they use in the presence of Yahweh, must be set apart to God by the cleansing, enabling, and sanctifying work of God.<br>
 <a name="fn1899" href="exo.htm#fnB1899"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:1)  <i>Heb</i> "the thing."<br>
 <a name="fn1900" href="exo.htm#fnB1900"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:1)  Literally: "take one bull, a `son' of the herd." <br>
 <a name="fn1901" href="exo.htm#fnB1901"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:1)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ym!T*</FONT> (<i>tamim</i>) means "perfect." The animals could not have diseases or be crippled or blind (see Mal 1). The requirement was designed to ensure that the people would give the best they had to Yahweh. The typology pointed to the sinless Messiah who would fulfill all these sacrifices in his one sacrifice on the cross. <br>
 <a name="fn1902" href="exo.htm#fnB1902"><sup>5</sup></a><b>sn</b> (29:2)  This will be for the <i>minha</i> offering (Lev 2) which was to accompany the animal sacrifices. <br>

 <a name="fn1904" href="exo.htm#fnB1904"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:2)  The "fine flour" is here an adverbial accusative, explaining the material from which these items were made. The flour is to be finely sifted, and from the wheat, not the barley, which was often the material used by the poor. Fine flour, no leaven, and perfect animals, without blemishes, were to be gathered for this service. <br>
 <a name="fn1905" href="exo.htm#fnB1905"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:3)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">brq</FONT> (<i>qarab</i>) in the Hiphil means to "bring near" to the altar, or, to offer something to God. These gifts will, therefore, be offered to him for the service of this ritual.<br>
 <a name="fn1906" href="exo.htm#fnB1906"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:3)  <i>Heb</i> "and with."<br>
 <a name="fn1907" href="exo.htm#fnB1907"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:4)  Here two the verb is the Hiphil (now imperfect) meaning "bring near" the altar. The choice of this verb indicates that they were not merely being brought near, but that they were being presented to Yahweh as the offerings were.<br>
 <a name="fn1908" href="exo.htm#fnB1908"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (29:4)  This is the washing referred to in Lev 8:6. This is a complete washing, and not just of the hands and feet that would follow in the course of service. It had to serve as a symbolic ritual cleansing or purifying as the initial stage in the consecration. The imagery of washing will be used in the NT for regeneration (Tit 3:5). <br>
 <a name="fn1909" href="exo.htm#fnB1909"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:5)  The Hiphil of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vbl</FONT> (<i>labas</i>), "to clothe," will take double accusatives; so the sign of the accusative is with Aaron, and then with the articles of clothing. The translation will have to treat Aaron as the direct object, and the articles as indirect objects, because Aaron receives the prominence in the verse--you will clothe Aaron.<br>
 <a name="fn1910" href="exo.htm#fnB1910"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:5)  The verb used in this last clause is a denominative verb from the word for ephod. The verb can only mean "to fasten as an ephod." And so "ephod the ephod on him" means "fasten as an ephod the ephod on him" (Driver, p. 316).<br>
 <a name="fn1911" href="exo.htm#fnB1911"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (29:6)  This term does not appear in chap. 28, but it can only refer to the platelet that was tied around the turban with the inscription on it. Here it is called a "holy diadem," a diadem that is distinctly set apart for this service. All the clothing was described as "holy garments," and so they were all meant to mark the separation of the priests to this holy service. The items of clothing all were intended for different aspects of ministry, and so this step in the consecration was designed to symbolize being set apart for those duties, or, prepared (gifted) to perform the ministry. <br>
 <a name="fn1912" href="exo.htm#fnB1912"><sup>15</sup></a><b>sn</b> (29:7)  The act of anointing was meant to set him apart for this holy service within the house of Yahweh. The psalms indicate that no oil was spared in this ritual, for it ran down his beard and to the hem of his garment. Oil of anointing was used for all major offices (giving the label with the passive adjective "<i>masiah</i>" (or "messiah") to anyone anointed. In the further revelation of Scripture, the oil came to signify the enablement as well as the setting apart, and so often the Holy Spirit came on the person at the anointing with oil. The olive oil was a symbol of the Spirit in the OT as well (Zech 4:4-6). And in the NT "anointing" does signify empowerment by the Holy Spirit for service. <br>
 <a name="fn1913" href="exo.htm#fnB1913"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tc</b> (29:9)  Neither the LXX nor Leviticus has "Aaron and his sons," suggesting that this was a later gloss in the text.<br>
 <a name="fn1914" href="exo.htm#fnB1914"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:9)  <i>Heb</i> "and you will consecrate," the verb draws together the individual acts of the process.<br>

 <a name="fn1916" href="exo.htm#fnB1916"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:10)  The verb is singular, agreeing with the first of the compound subject--Aaron.<br>
 <a name="fn1917" href="exo.htm#fnB1917"><sup>20</sup></a><b>sn</b> (29:10)  The details of these offerings have to be determined from a careful study of Leviticus. There is a good deal of debate over the meaning of laying hands on the animals. At the very least it identifies the animal formally as their sacrifices. But it may very well indicate that the animal is a substitute for them as well, given the nature and the effect of the sacrifices. <br>
 <a name="fn1918" href="exo.htm#fnB1918"><sup>21</sup></a><b>sn</b> (29:12)  This act seemed to signify the efficacious nature of the blood, since the horns represented power. This is part of the ritual of the sin offering for laity, because before the priests become priests they are treated as laity. The offering is better described as a purification offering rather than a sin offering, because it was offered according to Leviticus for both sins and impurities. Moreover, it was offered primarily to purify the sanctuary so that the once-defiled or sinful person could enter (see J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus</i>). <br>
 <a name="fn1919" href="exo.htm#fnB1919"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:12)  The phrase "rest of" has been supplied in the translation for clarification.<br>
 <a name="fn1920" href="exo.htm#fnB1920"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:13)  <i>Heb</i> "turn [them] into sweet smoke" since the word is used for burning incense.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (29:13)  The giving of the visceral organs and the fat has received various explanations. The fat represented the best, and the best was to go to God. If the animal is a substitute then the visceral organs represent the will of the worshiper in an act of surrender to God.<br>
 <a name="fn1921" href="exo.htm#fnB1921"><sup>24</sup></a><b>sn</b> (29:14)  This is to be done because there is no priesthood yet. Once they are installed, then the sin/purification offering is to be eaten by the officiating priests as a sign that the offering was received. But priests could not consume their own sin-offering. <br>
 <a name="fn1922" href="exo.htm#fnB1922"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (29:14)  There were two kinds, those made with confession for sin, and those made without. The title needs to cover both of them, and if it is called in the traditional way the sin offering, that will convey that when people offered it for skin diseases, menstruation, or having babies, they had sinned. That was not the case. Moreover, it is usual to translate the names of the sacrifices by what they do more than what they cover--so peace offering, reparation offering and purification offering. <br>
 <a name="fn1923" href="exo.htm#fnB1923"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:18)  <i>Heb</i> "turn to sweet smoke."<br>
 <a name="fn1924" href="exo.htm#fnB1924"><sup>27</sup></a><b>sn</b> (29:18)  According to Lev 1 the burnt offering (often called whole burnt offering, except that the skins were usually given to the priests for income) was an atoning sacrifice. By consuming the entire animal, God was indicating that he had completely accepted the worshiper; and as it was a sweet smelling fire sacrifice, he was indicating that he was pleased to accept it. By killing the entire animal, the worshiper was indicating on his part a complete surrender to God.<br>
 <a name="fn1925" href="exo.htm#fnB1925"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:18)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hV#a!</FONT> (<i>`isseh</i>) has traditionally been translated "an offering made with fire" or the like, because it appears so obviously connected with fire. But further evidence from Ugaritic suggests that it might only mean "a gift" (see Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i>, p. 161).<br>
 <a name="fn1926" href="exo.htm#fnB1926"><sup>29</sup></a><b>sn</b> (29:18)  These sections show that the priest had to be purified or cleansed from defilement of sin and also be atoned for and accepted by the LORD through the blood of the sacrifice. The principles from these two sacrifices should be basic to anyone seeking to serve God.<br>
 <a name="fn1927" href="exo.htm#fnB1927"><sup>30</sup></a><b>sn</b> (29:20)  By this ritual the priests were set apart completely to the service of God. The ear represented the organ of hearing (as in "ears you have dug" in Ps 40 or "awakens my ear" in Isa 50), and this had to be set apart to God so that they could hear the Word of God. The thumb and the hand represented the instrument to be used for all ministry, and so everything that they "put their hand to" had to be dedicated to God and appropriate for his service. The toe set the foot apart to God, meaning that the walk of the priest had to be consecrated--where he went, how he conducted himself, what life he lived, all belonged to God now. <br>
 <a name="fn1928" href="exo.htm#fnB1928"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:21)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hzn</FONT> (<i>naza</i>) does mean "sprinkle" in the Hiphil<i>;</i> but the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qrz</FONT> (<i>zaraq</i>) used in the last verse means "to toss, dash, splatter."<br>
 <a name="fn1929" href="exo.htm#fnB1929"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:21)  "it" has been supplied.<br>
 <a name="fn1930" href="exo.htm#fnB1930"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:21)  The verb in this instance is the Qal and not the Piel, "to be holy" rather than "sanctify." The result of all this ritual is that Aaron and his sons will be set aside and distinct in their life and their service. <br>

 <a name="fn1935" href="exo.htm#fnB1935"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:24)  The "wave offering" is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hp*WnT=</FONT> (<i>t<sup>e</sup>nupa</i>); it is, of course, cognate with the verb, but an adverbial accusative rather than the direct object. In Lev 23 this seems to be a sacrificial gesture of things that are for the priests--but they present them first to Yahweh and then receive them back from him. So the waving is not side to side, but forward to Yahweh and then back to the priest. Here it is just an induction into that routine, for as this is the ordination of the priests, the gifts are not yet theirs. So this will all be burnt up on the altar.<br>
 <a name="fn1936" href="exo.htm#fnB1936"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:25)  "turn to sweet smoke."<br>

 <a name="fn1938" href="exo.htm#fnB1938"><sup>41</sup></a><b>sn</b> (29:27)  These are the two special priestly offerings. The wave offering (from the verb "to wave") and the "presentation offering" [old: heave offering] (from a verb "to be high" in the Hiphil meaning "to lift up" and separated from the offering, a contribution). The two are then clarified with two corresponding relative clauses with the two Hophal<i>s</i> in them: "which was waved and which was presented." In making sacrifices, the breast and the thigh belong to the priests. <br>
 <a name="fn1939" href="exo.htm#fnB1939"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:28)  "share" has been added for clarification.<br>
 <a name="fn1940" href="exo.htm#fnB1940"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:29)  The construction is the infinitive construct with the <i>lamed</i> preposition. The form simply means "for anointing," but it serves to express the purpose or result of their inheriting the sacred garments.<br>
 <a name="fn1941" href="exo.htm#fnB1941"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:29)  This form is the Piel infinitive construct with the <i>lamed</i> preposition. It literally reads "for filling the hands," the idiom used throughout this chapter for ordination or installation. Here too it has a parallel use of purpose or result. <br>
 <a name="fn1942" href="exo.htm#fnB1942"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:30)  <i>Heb</i> "after him."<br>
 <a name="fn1943" href="exo.htm#fnB1943"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:30)  The text just has the relative pronoun and the imperfect tense. It could be translated "who comes/enters." But the context seems to indicate that this would be when he first comes to the Tent to begin his tenure as High Priest, and so a temporal clause makes this clear. "First" has been supplied.<br>
 <a name="fn1944" href="exo.htm#fnB1944"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:30)  "Seven days" is an adverbial accusative of time. The ritual of ordination is to be repeated for seven days, and so they are to remain there in the court in full dress.<br>

 <a name="fn1946" href="exo.htm#fnB1946"><sup>49</sup></a><b>sn</b> (29:31)  The "holy place" must be in the courtyard of the sanctuary. Lev 8:31 says it is to be cooked at the entrance of the tent of meeting. Here it says it will be eaten there as well. This, then, becomes a communion sacrifice, a peace offering which was a shared meal. The significance of eating the communal meal in a holy place was meant to signify that the worshipers and the priests were at peace with God. <br>
 <a name="fn1947" href="exo.htm#fnB1947"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:33)  The clause is a relative clause modifying "them," the direct object of the verb.

 <a name="fn1951" href="exo.htm#fnB1951"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:34)  The verb is the Niphal<i> </i>imperfect negated. It expresses the prohibition against eating this, but in the passive voice: "it will not be eaten," or stronger, "it must not be eaten." <br>
 <a name="fn1952" href="exo.htm#fnB1952"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:35)  The "seven days" is the adverbial accusative explaining that the ritual of the filling should continue daily for a week. Leviticus makes it clear that they are not to leave the sanctuary. <br>
 <a name="fn1953" href="exo.htm#fnB1953"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:36)  The construction uses a genitive: "a bull of the sin offering," which means, a bull that is designated for a sin (or better, purification) offering.<br>
 <a name="fn1954" href="exo.htm#fnB1954"><sup>57</sup></a><b>sn</b> (29:36)  It is difficult to understand how this verse is to be harmonized with the other passages. The ceremony in the earlier passages deal with atonement made for the priests, for people. But here it is the altar that is being sanctified. The "sin [purification] offering" as mentioned earlier is more of a purification of the sanctuary and altar to receive people in their worship. <br>
 <a name="fn1955" href="exo.htm#fnB1955"><sup>58</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:36)  The verb is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">t*aF@j!w+</FONT> (<i>w<sup>e</sup>hitte'ta</i>), the Piel perfect of the word usually translated "to sin." Here it may be interpreted as a privative Piel (as in Ps 51:7 [9]), with the sense of "un-sin" or "remove sin." It could also be interpreted as related to the word for "sin offering," and so be a denominative verb. It means "to purify, cleanse." The Hebrews understood that sin and contamination could corrupt and pollute even things; and so they had to be purged.<br>
 <a name="fn1956" href="exo.htm#fnB1956"><sup>59</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:36)  The construction is the Piel<i> </i>infinitive construct in an adverbial clause. The preposition <i>bet</i> that begins the clause could be taken as a temporal preposition, but in this context it seems to express the means by which the altar was purged of contamination-- "in your making atonement" is "by [your] making atonement."<br>
 <a name="fn1957" href="exo.htm#fnB1957"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:37)  Once again this is an adverbial accusative or time. Each day for seven days the ritual at the altar is to be followed.<br>
 <a name="fn1958" href="exo.htm#fnB1958"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:37)  The construction is the superlative genitive: "holy of holies," or "most holy."

 <a name="fn1959" href="exo.htm#fnB1959"><sup>62</sup></a><b>sn</b> (29:37)  This line is a very unusual principle, but is meant to preserve the sanctity of the altar. Driver explains it this way (p. 325): If anything comes in contact with the altar, it becomes holy, and must remain in the sanctuary for Yahweh's use. If a person touches the altar, he likewise becomes holy and cannot return to the profane regions. He will be given over to God to be dealt with as God pleases. Anyone who was not qualified to touch the altar did not dare approach it, for contact would have meant that he was no longer free to leave, but God's holy possession--and might pay for it with his life (see Exod 30:29; Lev 6:18b, 27; and Ezek 46:20). <br>

The main verb of the clause is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">du@Wa!</FONT> (<i>`iwwa'ed</i>), the Niphal imperfect of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">duy</FONT> (<i>ya'ad</i>), the verb that is cognate to the name "tent of meeting"--hence the name. This clause leads into the next four verses. <br>
 <a name="fn1966" href="exo.htm#fnB1966"><sup>69</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:43)  The verb now is the Niphal perfect from the same root, with the <i>vav</i> consecutive. It simply continues the preceding verb, announcing now that he would meet the people.<br>

 <a name="fn1968" href="exo.htm#fnB1968"><sup>71</sup></a><b>tn</b> (29:44)  This verse affirms the same point as the last, but now with an active verb: "I will sanctify." This verse, then, probably introduces the conclusion of the chapter: "So I will...."<br>

 <a name="fn1970" href="exo.htm#fnB1970"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (30:1)  Why this section has been held until now is a mystery. One would have expected it to be included with the other furnishings. The widespread contemporary view that it was later does not answer the question, it merely moves the issue to the work of the editor rather than the author. It may be that the items listed earlier were more critical for the beginning of tabernacle service and the ordination. The ten verses can be divided into three sections: the instructions for building it (1-5), the place to put it (6), and the proper use for it (7-10).<br>
 <a name="fn1971" href="exo.htm#fnB1971"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:1)  The expression is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tr#f)q= rf^q=m! j~B@z+m! </FONT>(<i>mizbeah miqtar q<sup>e</sup>toret</i>), either "an altar, namely an altar of incense," or "an altar, [for] burning incense." The second noun is "altar of incense," although some suggest it is an active noun meaning "burning." If the former, then it is in apposition to the word for "altar" (which is not in construct). The last noun is "incense" or "sweet smoke." It either qualifies the "altar of incense" or serves as the object of the active noun.<br>

 <a name="fn1979" href="exo.htm#fnB1979"><sup>10</sup></a><b>sn</b> (30:4)  Since it is a small altar, it only needed to have two rings, one on either side, in order to carry the object.

 <a name="fn1980" href="exo.htm#fnB1980"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn </b> (30:4) <i>Heb</i> "And it"; this refers to the rings collectively, and so the translation "rings" has been used to clarify the referent for the modern reader.<br>
 <a name="fn1981" href="exo.htm#fnB1981"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:7)  The text uses a cognate accusative ("incense") with the verb "to burn" or "to make into incense/sweet smoke." Then, the noun "sweet spices" is added in apposition to clarify the incense as sweet.<br>
 <a name="fn1982" href="exo.htm#fnB1982"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:7)  The Hebrew is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">obyf!yh@B=</FONT> (<i>b<sup>e</sup>hetibo</i>), the Hiphil infinitive construct serving in a temporal clause. The verb means "to make good" and so in this context "to fix" or "to dress." This refers to cleansing and trimming the lamps. <br>
 <a name="fn1983" href="exo.htm#fnB1983"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (30:7)  The point of the little golden altar of incense is normally for intercessory prayer, and then at the Day of Atonement for blood applied atonement. The instructions for making it show that God wanted his people to make a place for prayer. And the instructions for its use shows that God expects his peoples requests will be pleasing to him. <br>
 <a name="fn1984" href="exo.htm#fnB1984"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:8)  The word "incense" is not in the Hebrew text, but is implied.<br>
 <a name="fn1985" href="exo.htm#fnB1985"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:10)  The word "atonements" is a genitive showing the result or product of the sacrifice made. <br>
 <a name="fn1986" href="exo.htm#fnB1986"><sup>17</sup></a><b>sn</b> (30:10)  This ruling presupposes the instructions for the Day of Atonement have been given, or at the very least, is to be given shortly. That is the one day of the year that all sin and all ritual impurity would be removed. <br>
 <a name="fn1987" href="exo.htm#fnB1987"><sup>18</sup></a><b>sn</b> (30:10)  The statement <i>most holy to the </i>LORD means that the altar cannot be used for any other purpose than what is stated here. <br>
 <a name="fn1988" href="exo.htm#fnB1988"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (30:11)  This brief section has been interpreted a number of ways by biblical scholars (for a good survey and discussion, see Jacob's commentary ( 829-835). It may be impossible to determine exactly what was happening here. But it seems that there may have been a belief that taking a census was a sin, or at least opened the nation up to peril. But some scholars see the taking of a census as an important part of the nation's guarding against peril. The dangers that they faced were great, and so a ransom price had to be paid to secure safety. In this context the danger of erecting and caring for a sanctuary was in view. So a census would be taken to count the losses, and to cover the danger of coming into such proximity with the holy place; payment was made to ransom the lives of the people numbered so that they would not die. Of course, the practical side of the census is to determine taxation. The money collected would safeguard the people against the dangers and perils, and then be used for the care of the sanctuary. The principle was fairly straightforward: Those numbered among the redeemed of the LORD were to support the work of the LORD to maintain their fellowship with the covenant. The passage is fairly easy to outline: I. Every covenant member must give a ransom for his life to avoid death (11,12); II. The ransom is the same for all, whether rich of poor 13-15); and III. The ransom money supports the sanctuary as a memorial for the ransomed (16).<br>
 <a name="fn1989" href="exo.htm#fnB1989"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:11)  <i>Heb</i> "and Yahweh said."<br>
 <a name="fn1990" href="exo.htm#fnB1990"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:11)  The expression is "when you take [lift up] the sum [head] of the Israelites." <br>
 <a name="fn1991" href="exo.htm#fnB1991"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:11)  The form is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;h#yd@q%p=l!</FONT> (<i>lipqudehem</i>), "according to those that are numbered of/by them," from the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dqP</FONT> (<i>paqad</i>), "to visit." But the idea of this root word seems more to be that of changing or determining the destiny, and so "appoint" and "number" become clear categories of meaning for the word. Here it simply refers to the census, but when this word is used for a census it often was for mustering an army, for a military purpose. Here there is no indication of a war, but it may be laying down the principle that when they should do this, this is the price. Jacob uses Num 31 as a good illustration, showing that the warrior was essentially a murderer, if he killed anyone in battle. For this reason his blood was forfeit; if he survives he must be a <i>kofer</i> because every human life possesses value and must be atoned for. The payment during the census represented a "presumptive ransom" so that they could not be faulted for what they might do in war (p. 835). <br>
 <a name="fn1992" href="exo.htm#fnB1992"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:11)  The "ransom" is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rp#K)</FONT> (<i>koper</i>), a word related to the verb "atone." Here the noun refers to what is paid for the life. The idea is that of delivering or redeeming by a substitute--here the substitute as the money. If they paid the amount, their lives would be safe (Kaiser, p. 473).<br>
 <a name="fn1993" href="exo.htm#fnB1993"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:11)  The temporal clause uses the preposition, the infinitive construct, and then the accusative. The subject is supplied: "in numbering them" means "when [you] number them." The verb could also be rendered "when you muster them."<br>
 <a name="fn1994" href="exo.htm#fnB1994"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (30:13)  Each man was to pass in front of the counting officer and join those already counted on the other side. <br>

 <a name="fn1996" href="exo.htm#fnB1996"><sup>27</sup></a><b>sn</b> (30:13)  It appears that some standard is in view for the amount of a shekel weight. The sanctuary shekel is usually considered to be twice the value of the ordinary shekel (the "gerah," of uncertain meaning, indicated what that was). It may also be that the expression meant "a sacred shekel" and looked at the purpose more--a shekel for sanctuary dues. This would mean that the standard of the shekel weight was set because it was the traditional amount of sacred dues (Driver, p. 333). <br>
 <a name="fn1997" href="exo.htm#fnB1997"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:13)  Or "contribution" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hm*WrT=</FONT> [<i>t<sup>e</sup>ruma</i>]), an offering "taken off" the man's property for sacred purposes. <br>

 <a name="fn1999" href="exo.htm#fnB1999"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:15)  The form is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tt@l*</FONT> (<i>latet</i>), the Qal infinitive construct with the <i>lamed</i> preposition. The use of the infinitive here is epexegetical, that is, explaining the preceding verbs. They are not to increase or diminish the amount "in paying the offering." The construction approximates a temporal clause.<br>
 <a name="fn2000" href="exo.htm#fnB2000"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:15)  This infinitive construct (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rP@k^l=</FONT> [<i>l<sup>e</sup>kapper</i>]) provides the purpose of the giving the offering--to atone. <br>
 <a name="fn2001" href="exo.htm#fnB2001"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:16)  This reads "the silver of the atonements." The genitive here is the result (as in "sheep of slaughter") telling what the money will be used for (see Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, &#167;44).<br>
 <a name="fn2002" href="exo.htm#fnB2002"><sup>33</sup></a><b>sn</b> (30:16)  The idea of "service" is maintenance and care of the sanctuary service, meaning the morning and evening sacrifices and the other elements to be used. <br>

It was a round (the root means to be round) basin for holding water, but it had to be up on a pedestal or base to letter water run out (through taps of some kind) for the priests to wash--they could not simply dip dirty hands into the basin. This was for the priests primarily to wash their hands and feet before entering the tent. It stood in the courtyard between the altar and the tent. No dimension are given. The passage can be divided into three sections: the instructions (17-18), the rules for washing (19-20), and the reminder that this is a perpetual statute.<br>

 <a name="fn2011" href="exo.htm#fnB2011"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:20)  "Water" is an adverbial accusative of means, and so is translated "<i>with</i> water." Gesenius classifies this with verbs of "covering <i>with</i> something." But he prefers to emend the text with a preposition (see GKC &#167;117.<i>y</i>, note).<br>
 <a name="fn2012" href="exo.htm#fnB2012"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:20)  The verb is the Qal imperfect with a nuance of final imperfect. The purpose/result clause here is indicated only with the conjunction: "and they do not die."

 <a name="fn2013" href="exo.htm#fnB2013"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:20)  Here, too, the infinitive is used in a temporal clause construction.

 <a name="fn2014" href="exo.htm#fnB2014"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:20)  The text uses two infinitives construct: "to minister to burn incense"; the first is the general term and expresses the purpose of the drawing near, and the second infinitive is epexegetical, explaining the first infinitive.<br>
 <a name="fn2015" href="exo.htm#fnB2015"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:20)  The translation "as an offering made by fire" is a standard rendering of the one word in the text that appears to refer to "fire."

 <b>sn</b> (30:21)  The symbolic meaning of washing has been caught throughout the ages. This was a practical matter of cleaning hands and feet, but it was also symbolic of purification before Yahweh. It was an outward sign of inner spiritual cleansing, or forgiveness. Jesus washed the disciples feet (Jn 13) to show this same teaching; he asked the disciples if they knew what he had done (so it was more than washing feet). In this passage the theological points for the outline would be these: I. God provides the means of cleansing; II. Cleansing is a prerequisite for participating in the worship, and III. (Believers) priests must regularly appropriate God's provision of cleansing.<br>
 <a name="fn2020" href="exo.htm#fnB2020"><sup>51</sup></a><b>sn</b> (30:22)  The chapter ends with these two sections. The oil (22-33) is the mark of consecration; and the incense (34-38) is a mark of pleasing service, especially in prayer. So the essence of the message of the chapter is that the servants of God must be set apart by the Spirit for ministry and must be pleasing to God in the ministry. <br>
 <a name="fn2021" href="exo.htm#fnB2021"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (30:23)  The construction uses the imperative "take"; but before it is the independent pronoun to add emphasis to it. And after it is the ethical dative to stress the form: "and you, you take...."<br>

Cassuto says that since there is no meaning like that for the Pual form, the word probably should be taken as "mixed" (Rashi, <i>Targum Onqelos</i>). Seasoning with salt would work if it were food; but since it is not food, if it means "salted" it would be a symbol of what was sound and whole for the covenant.

This chapter would have been the bridge to the building of the sanctuary (35-39) if it were not for the idolatrous interlude. But the text of this section is not complicated: God called individuals and prepared them by his Spirit to be skilled to do the work for the tabernacle. If this were the substance of an exposition, it would clearly be a message on gifted people doing the work--close to the spiritual lesson of Ephesians 4. There would be two levels of meaning: the physical, which looks at the skilled artisans providing for a place to worship Yahweh, and the spiritual, which would bring in the Spirit-filled servants of God participating in building up his kingdom.<br>

 <a name="fn2058" href="exo.htm#fnB2058"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (31:13)  The instruction for the sabbath at this point seems rather abrupt, but it follows logically the extended plans of building the sanctuary. Jacob, following some of the earlier treatments, suggests that these are specific rules given for the duration of the building of the sanctuary (p. 844). The Sabbath Day is a day of complete cessation; no labor or work could be done. The point in here is that God's covenant people must faithfully keep the sign of the covenant as a living commemoration of the finished work of Yahweh, and as an active part in their sanctification. See also H. Routtenberg, "The Laws of Sabbath: Biblical Sources," <i>Dor l<sup>e</sup> Dor</i> 6 (1977): 41-43, 99-101, 153-55, 204-206; G.

This form serves as the subject of the sentence. The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">llj</FONT> (<i>halal</i>) is the antonym of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vdq</FONT> (<i>qadas</i>), "to be holy." It means "common, profane," and in the Piel stem "make common, profane" or "defile." Treating the Sabbath like an ordinary day would profane it, make it common. <br>

 <a name="fn2066" href="exo.htm#fnB2066"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:15)  This is an adverbial accusative of time, indicating that work may be done for six days out of the week.<br>
 <a name="fn2067" href="exo.htm#fnB2067"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:15)  The form is the Niphal imperfect; it has the nuance of permission in this sentence, for the sentence is simply saying that the six days are work days--that is when work may be done.<br>
 <a name="fn2068" href="exo.htm#fnB2068"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:15)  The expression is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/otB*v^ tB^v^</FONT> (<i>sabbat sabbaton</i>), "a sabbath of entire rest," or better, "a sabbath of complete desisting" (Cassuto, p. 404). The second noun, the modifying genitive, is an abstract noun. The repetition provides the superlative idea that complete rest is the order of the day.<br>
 <a name="fn2069" href="exo.htm#fnB2069"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:17)  The expression again forms an adverbial accusative of time.<br>
 <a name="fn2070" href="exo.htm#fnB2070"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (31:17)  The word "rest" essentially means "to cease, stop." So in describing God as "resting" on the seventh day does not indicate that he was tired--he simply finished creation and then ceased or stopped. But in this verse we have a very bold anthropomorphism in the form of the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vp^NY]w~</FONT> (<i>wayyinnapas</i>), the Niphal preterite from the root <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vpn</FONT> (<i>napas</i>), the word that is related to "life, soul" or more specifically "breath, throat." The verb is usually translated here as "he was refreshed," offering a very human picture. It could also be rendered "he took breath" (Driver, p. 345). Elsewhere the verb is used of people and animals. The anthropomorphism is clearly intended to teach people to stop and refresh themselves physically, spiritually and emotionally on this day of rest. <br>
 <a name="fn2071" href="exo.htm#fnB2071"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (31:18)  The expression "the finger of God" has come up before in the book, in the plagues (Exod 8:15) to express that it was a demonstration of the power and authority of God. So here too the commandments given to Moses on stone tablets came from God . It too is a bold anthropomorphism; to attribute such a material action to Yahweh would have been thought provoking to say the least. But by using "God" and by stating it in such an obviously figurative way, that effect was prevented. Since no one writes with one finger, the expression simply says that the Law came directly from God.<br>
 <a name="fn2072" href="exo.htm#fnB2072"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:1)  This narrative is an unhappy interlude in the flow of the argument of the book. Between the giving of the Law and the instructions for the tabernacle the people get into idolatry. So this section tells what the people were doing when Moses was on the mountain. Here is an instant violation of the covenant that they had just agreed to uphold. But through it all Moses shines as the great intercessor for the people. So the subject matter is the sin of idolatry, its effects and its remedy. Because of the similarities to Jeroboam's setting up the calves in Dan and Bethel, modern critics have often said this passage was written at that time. Cassuto shows how the language of this chapter would not fit an Iron Age setting in Dan. Rather, he argues, this story was well enough known for Jeroboam to imitate the practice (Cassuto, 407-10). This chapter can be divided into four parts for an easier exposition: idolatry (32:1-6), intercession (32:7-14), judgment (32:15-29), intercession again (32:30-33:6). Of course, these sections are far more complex than this, but this gives an overview. To put these sections into four statements for expository points, we have: I. Impatience often leads to foolish violations of the faith, II. Violations of the covenant require intercession to escape condemnation, III. Those spared of divine wrath must purge evil from their midst, and IV. Those who purge evil from their midst will find reinstatement through intercession. Several important studies are available for this: R. Moberly, <i>At the Mountain of God: Story and Theology in Exodus 32-34</i> (Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1983); G. Coats, "The King's Loyal Opposition: Obedience and Authority in Exodus 32-34," in <i>Canon and Authority</i> (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1977), 91-109; D. R. Davis, "Rebellion, Presence, and Covenant: A Study in Exodus 32-34," <i>WTJ</i> 44 (1982): 71-87; M.

 <a name="fn2073" href="exo.htm#fnB2073"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:1)  The meaning of this verb is properly "caused shame," meaning cause disappointment because he was not coming back (see also Judg 5:28 for the delay of Sisera's chariots [Driver, p. 349]).<br>
 <a name="fn2074" href="exo.htm#fnB2074"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:1)  The infinitive construct with the <i>lamed</i> preposition is used here epexegetically, explaining the delay of Moses.<br>

 <a name="fn2076" href="exo.htm#fnB2076"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:1)  The imperative means "arise." It could be serving here as an interjection, getting Aaron's attention. But it might also have the force of prompting him to get busy.<br>
 <a name="fn2077" href="exo.htm#fnB2077"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:1)  The plural translation is required here (although the form itself could be singular in meaning) because the verb that follows in the relative clause is a plural verb--that they go before us).<br>
 <a name="fn2078" href="exo.htm#fnB2078"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:1)  The text has "this Moses." But here we may have the demonstrative used in an earlier deictic sense, especially since there is no article with it.<br>
 <a name="fn2079" href="exo.htm#fnB2079"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:1)  The interrogative is used in an indirect question (see GKC &#167;137.<i>c</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn2080" href="exo.htm#fnB2080"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:2)  Jacob argues that Aaron simply did not have the resolution that Moses did, and wanting to keep peace he gave in to the crowd. He also tries to explain that Aaron was wanting to show their folly through the deed ( 937-38). Cassuto also says that Aaron's request for the gold was a form of procrastination, but that the people quickly did it and so he had no alternative but to go through with it (p. 412). These may be right, since Aaron fully understood what was wrong with this, and what the program was all about. The text gives no strong indication to support these ideas, but there are enough hints from the way Aaron does things to warrant such a conclusion. <br>
 <a name="fn2081" href="exo.htm#fnB2081"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:3)  This "all" is a natural hyperbole in the narrative, for it means the large majority of the people.<br>
 <a name="fn2082" href="exo.htm#fnB2082"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:4)  "them" has been supplied.<br>
 <a name="fn2083" href="exo.htm#fnB2083"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:4)  The verb looks like <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rXy</FONT> (<i>yasar</i>), "to form, fashion" by a plan or a design. That is the verb used in Gen 2:7 for Yahweh God forming the man from the dust of the ground. If it is here, it is the reverse, a human--the dust of the ground--trying to form a god or gods. The active participle of this verb in Hebrew is "the potter." And a related noun is the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rX#y@</FONT> (<i>yeser</i>), "evil inclination," the wicked designs or intent of the human heart (Gen 6:5). But see the discussion by Childs on a different reading, one that links the root to a hollow verb meaning "to cast out of metal" (as in 1 Kgs 7:15). The form in the text is pointed as a preterite from the hollow or geminate root; if it is from the verb "form, fashion," then the <i>vav</i> consecutive cannot be correct (see 555,6).<br>
 <a name="fn2084" href="exo.htm#fnB2084"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:4)  The word means a "young bull" and need not be translated as "calf" (although "calf" has become the traditional rendering in English). The word could describe an animal three years old. Aaron probably made an inner structure of wood, and then after melting down the gold, plated it. The verb "molten" does not need to imply that the image was solid gold; the word is used in Isa 30:22 for gold plating. So it was a young bull calf that was overlaid with gold, and the gold was fashioned with the stylus.<br>
 <a name="fn2085" href="exo.htm#fnB2085"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:4)  The word could be singular here and earlier; here it would then be "this is your god, O Israel." However, the use of "these"indicates more than one god was meant by the image. But their statement and their statue, although they do not use the holy name, violate the first two commandments. <br>
 <a name="fn2086" href="exo.htm#fnB2086"><sup>15</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:4)  Jacob says that they actually returned to Egypt with this golden calf (p. 940). <br>
 <a name="fn2087" href="exo.htm#fnB2087"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:5)  The preterite with the <i>vav </i>consecutive is subordinated as a temporal clause to the next preterite.<br>
 <a name="fn2088" href="exo.htm#fnB2088"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:5)  "this" have been supplied.<br>
 <a name="fn2089" href="exo.htm#fnB2089"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:5)  "Before it" means before the deity in the form of the calf. Aaron tried to redirect their worship to Yahweh, but the people had already broken down the barrier and were beyond control (U. Cassuto, p. 413).<br>
 <a name="fn2090" href="exo.htm#fnB2090"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:5)  <i>Heb</i> "called."<br>
 <a name="fn2091" href="exo.htm#fnB2091"><sup>20</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:5)  The word is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">gj^</FONT> (<i>hag</i>), the pilgrim's festival. This was the word used by Moses for their pilgrimage into the wilderness. Aaron seems here to be trying to do what Moses had intended they do, make a feast to Yahweh at Sinai, but his efforts will not compete with the idol. As Jacob says, Aaron saw all this happening and tried to rescue the true belief (p. 941). <br>
 <a name="fn2092" href="exo.htm#fnB2092"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:6)  The second infinitive is the infinitive absolute. The first is the infinitive construct with the <i>lamed</i> preposition, so it serves as a genitive, expressing the purpose of their sitting down. The infinitive absolute that follows cannot take the preposition, but with the conjunction follows the force of the form before it (see GKC &#167;113.<i>e</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn2093" href="exo.htm#fnB2093"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:6)  The form is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">qjx^l=</FONT> (<i>l<sup>e</sup>saheq</i>), the Piel infinitive construct, giving the purpose of their rising up after the festal meal. On the surface it would seem that with the festival there would be singing and dancing, so that the people were celebrating even though they did not know the reason. Kaiser says the word means "drunken immoral orgies and sexual play" (p. 478). That is quite an assumption for this word. The word means "to play, trifle." It can have other meanings in contexts. It is used of Lot when he warned his sons-in-law and appeared as one who "mocked" them; it is also used of Ishmael "playing" with Isaac, which Paul interprets as mocking; it is used of Isaac "playing" with his wife in a manner that revealed to Abimelech that they were not brother and sister; and it is used by Potipher's wife to say that her husband brought this slave Joseph in to "mock" them. The most that can be gathered from these is that it is playful teasing, serious mocking, or playful caresses. It might fit with wild orgies, but there is no indication of that in our passage, and the word does not mean it. The fact that they were festive and playing before an idol was sufficient.<br>
 <a name="fn2094" href="exo.htm#fnB2094"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:7)  The two imperatives could also express one idea: "get down there." In other words, "Make haste to get down."<br>
 <a name="fn2095" href="exo.htm#fnB2095"><sup>24</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:7)  By giving the people to Moses in this way, God is saying that they have no longer any right to claim him as their God, since they have shared his honor with another. This is God's talionic response to their "These are your gods who brought you up." The use of these pronoun changes also would form an appeal to Moses to respond, since Moses knew that God had brought them up from Egypt. <br>
 <a name="fn2096" href="exo.htm#fnB2096"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:7)  The verb is a perfect tense, reflecting the present perfect nuance: "they have turned aside" and are still disobedient. But the verb is modified with the adverb (actually a Piel infinitive absolute), "quickly." It has only been a couple of weeks or so since they heard the voice of God prohibiting this. <br>
 <a name="fn2097" href="exo.htm#fnB2097"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:9)  This is a bold anthropomorphism; it is as if God has now had a chance to get to know these people and has discovered how rebellious they are.

 <a name="fn2099" href="exo.htm#fnB2099"><sup>28</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:9)  Jacob says the image is that of the people walking before God, and when he called to them the directions, they would not bend their neck to listen or to hear; they were resolute in doing what they intended to do (p. 943). The figure describes them as refusing to submit, but resisting in pride. <br>
 <a name="fn2100" href="exo.htm#fnB2100"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:10)  The imperative, from the word "to rest" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">j~Wn</FONT> [<i>nuah</i>]), has the sense of "leave me alone, let me be." It is a directive for Moses <i>not to intercede</i> for the people. Childs reflects the Jewish interpretation that there is a profound paradox in God's words. He vows the severest punishment, but then suddenly conditions it on Moses agreement. "Let me alone that I may consume them" is the statement, but the effect is that he has left the door open for intercession. He allows himself to be persuaded--that is what a mediator is for. God could have slammed the door (as when Moses wanted to go into the promised land). Moreover, by alluding to the promise to Abraham God gave Moses the strongest reason to intercede (Childs, p. 567, drawing especially on Jacob).<br>
 <a name="fn2101" href="exo.htm#fnB2101"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:11)  Driver draws on Arabic to show that the meaning of this verb (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlj</FONT> [<i>hala</i>]) was properly "make sweet the face" or "stroke the face"; so here "to entreat, seek to conciliate." In this prayer, Driver adds, Moses urges four motives for mercy: 1) Israel is Yahweh's people, 2) Israel's deliverance has demanded great power, 3) the Egyptians would mock if the people now perished, and 4) the oath God made to the fathers (p. 351).<br>
 <a name="fn2102" href="exo.htm#fnB2102"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:12)  The question is rhetorical; it really forms an affirmation that is used here as a reason for the request (see GKC &#167;150.<i>e</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn2103" href="exo.htm#fnB2103"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:12)  <i>Heb</i> "speak, saying." This is redundant in English and has been simplified in the translation.<br>
 <a name="fn2104" href="exo.htm#fnB2104"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:12)  The word "evil" means any kind of life-threatening or ending calamity. "Evil" is that which hinders life, interrupts life, causes pain to life, or destroys it. The Egyptians would conclude that such a God would have no good intent in taking his people to the desert if now he destroyed them. <br>
 <a name="fn2105" href="exo.htm#fnB2105"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:12)  The form is the Piel infinitive construct from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hlK</FONT> (<i>kala</i>), "to complete, finish," but in this stem, "bring to an end, destroy." As a purpose infinitive this expresses what the Egyptians would have thought of God's motive.<br>
 <a name="fn2106" href="exo.htm#fnB2106"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:12)  The verb "repent, relent" when used of God is certainly an anthropomorphism. It expresses the deep pain that one would have over a situation. So we read that God repented that he had made humans (Gen 6). Here Moses is asking God to repent/relent over the judgment he was about to bring, meaning that he should be moved by such compassion that there would be no judgment like that. Hyatt reminds us that the Bible uses so many anthropomorphisms because the Israelites conceived of God as a dynamic and living person in a vital relationship with people, responding to their needs and attitudes and actions (p. 307).

 <a name="fn2125" href="exo.htm#fnB2125"><sup>54</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:24)  Aaron first tried to blame the people, and then he tried to make it sound like a miracle--was it to sound like one of the plagues where out of the furnace came life? This text does not mention it, but Deut 9:20 tells how angry God was with Aaron. Only intercession saved his life. <br>
 <a name="fn2126" href="exo.htm#fnB2126"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:25)  The word is difficult to interpret. There does not seem to be enough evidence to justify the older translation "naked." It appears to mean something like "let loose" or "lack restraint" (Prov 29:18). The idea seems to be that the people had broken loose, were undisciplined, and were completely given over to their desires. <br>
 <a name="fn2127" href="exo.htm#fnB2127"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:25)  These last two words read literally "for a whispering among those who rose up against them." The foes would have mocked and derided them when they heard that they abandoned the God who led them out of Egypt (Driver, p. 354).<br>
 <a name="fn2128" href="exo.htm#fnB2128"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:26)  "come" is not in the text, but has been supplied.<br>

 <a name="fn2131" href="exo.htm#fnB2131"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:27)  The two imperatives form a verbal hendiadys: "pass over and return," meaning, "go back and forth" throughout the camp.<br>
 <a name="fn2132" href="exo.htm#fnB2132"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:27)  The phrases have "and kill a man his brother, and a man his companion, and a man his neighbor." The instructions were probably intended to mean to kill the guilty leaders whether they were brothers, friends or relatives--those they knew to be guilty because they were seen, or because they failed the water test. <br>
 <a name="fn2133" href="exo.htm#fnB2133"><sup>62</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:28)  <i>Heb</i> "did according to the word of Moses."<br>
 <a name="fn2134" href="exo.htm#fnB2134"><sup>63</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:28)  <i>Heb</i> "fell." <br>
 <a name="fn2135" href="exo.htm#fnB2135"><sup>64</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:29)  The Hebrew has the phrase "fill your hands," a familiar expression for consecration. This has usually been explained as a Qal imperative. Driver explains it "Fill your hand today," meaning, take a sacrifice to God and be installed in the priesthood (p. 355). But it probably is a Piel perfect, meaning "they have filled your hands today," or, "your hand was filled today." This was an expression meant to say that they had been faithful to God even though it turned them against family and friends--but God would give them a blessing.<br>
 <a name="fn2136" href="exo.htm#fnB2136"><sup>65</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:29)  The text simply has "and to give on you today a blessing." Gesenius notes that the infinitive construct seems to be attached with a <i>vav</i> (like the infinitive absolute) as the continuation of a previous finite verb. He reads the imperative: "fill your hand today...and that to bring a blessing on you, i.e., that you may be blessed" (see GKC &#167;114.<i>p</i>). If we take the verb as the perfect tense, then this would also be the perfect-- "he has blessed you today."<br>
 <a name="fn2137" href="exo.htm#fnB2137"><sup>66</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:30)  <i>Heb</i> "and it was on the morrow and Moses said to the people."<br>
 <a name="fn2138" href="exo.htm#fnB2138"><sup>67</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:30)  The text uses a cognate accusative: "you have sinned a great sin."<br>
 <a name="fn2139" href="exo.htm#fnB2139"><sup>68</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:30)  The form <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hr*P=k^a&amp;</FONT> (<i>`akapp<sup>e</sup>ra</i>) is the Piel cohortative/imperfect. Here with only a possibility of being successful, a potential imperfect nuance works best.<br>
 <a name="fn2140" href="exo.htm#fnB2140"><sup>69</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:31)  As before, the cognate accusative is used; it would literally be "this people has sinned a great sin."<br>
 <a name="fn2141" href="exo.htm#fnB2141"><sup>70</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:32)  The apodosis is not expressed; it would be understood as "good." It is not stated because of the intensity of the expression (the figure is aposiopesis, a sudden silence). It is also possible to take this first clause as a desire and not a conditional clause, rendering it "O that you would forgive!"<br>
 <a name="fn2142" href="exo.htm#fnB2142"><sup>71</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:32)  The word "blot" is a figure of speech indicating "remove me" (meaning he wants to die). The translation "blot" is traditional, but not very satisfactory; it does not convey complete removal. <br>
 <a name="fn2143" href="exo.htm#fnB2143"><sup>72</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:32)  The book that is referred to here should not be interpreted as the NT "book of life" which is portrayed (figuratively) as a register of all the names of the saints who are redeemed and will inherit eternal life. Here it refers to the names of those who are living and serving in this life, whose names, it was imagined, were on the roster in the heavenly courts as belonging to the chosen. Moses would rather die than live if these people are not forgiven (Driver, p. 356). <br>
 <a name="fn2144" href="exo.htm#fnB2144"><sup>73</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:34)  <i>Heb</i> "behold, look."<br>
 <a name="fn2145" href="exo.htm#fnB2145"><sup>74</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:34)  The Law said that he would in no wise clear the guilty. But here the punishment is postponed to some future date when God would re-visit this matter. Others have taken the line to mean that whenever a reckoning was considered necessary, then this sin would be included (see Jacob, p. 957).<br>
 <a name="fn2146" href="exo.htm#fnB2146"><sup>75</sup></a><b>tn</b> (32:35)  The verse is difficult because of the double reference to the making of the calf. The NJPS's translation tries to reconcile the two by reading "for what they did with the calf that Aaron had made." Childs explains in some detail why this is not a good translation based on syntactical grounds; he opts for the conclusion that the last three words are a clumsy secondary addition (p. 557). It seems preferable to take the view that both are true, Aaron is singled out for his obvious lead in the sin, but the people sinned by instigating the whole thing. <br>
 <a name="fn2147" href="exo.htm#fnB2147"><sup>76</sup></a><b>sn</b> (32:35)  Most commentators have difficulty with this last verse. Driver thinks it reads like a scribe's correction, but is out of place. Kaiser says the strict chronology is not always kept, and so the plague here may very well refer to the killing of the three thousand (p. 481). <br>
 <a name="fn2148" href="exo.htm#fnB2148"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:1)  The two imperatives underscore the immediacy of the demand: "go, go up," meaning "get going up" or "be on your way."<br>
 <a name="fn2149" href="exo.htm#fnB2149"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:1)  Or "the land which I swore."<br>

 <a name="fn2151" href="exo.htm#fnB2151"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (33:2)  This seems not to be the same as the Angel of the Presence introduced before. <br>

 <a name="fn2153" href="exo.htm#fnB2153"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:3)  This verse seems to be a continuation of the command to "go up" since it begins with "to a land...." The intervening clauses are therefore parenthetical or relative. But the translation is made simpler by supplying the verb.<br>
 <a name="fn2154" href="exo.htm#fnB2154"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:3)  This is a strong adversative here, "but."<br>
 <a name="fn2155" href="exo.htm#fnB2155"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:3)  The clause is "lest I consume you." It would go with the decision not to accompany them: "I will not go up with you...lest I consume (destroy) you in the way." The verse is saying that because of the people's bent to rebellion, Yahweh would not remain in their midst as he had formerly said he would do. Their lives might be at risk if he did.<br>
 <a name="fn2156" href="exo.htm#fnB2156"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:4)  Or "bad news."<br>
 <a name="fn2157" href="exo.htm#fnB2157"><sup>10</sup></a><b>sn</b> (33:4)  The people would rather have risked divine discipline than to go without Yahweh in their midst. So they mourned, and they took of the ornaments. Such had been used in the making of the golden calf, and so because of their association with all of that they were to be removed as a sign of remorse. <br>
 <a name="fn2158" href="exo.htm#fnB2158"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:5)  The verse simply begins "And Yahweh said." But the verse is clearly meant to be explanatory for the preceding action of the people.<br>
 <a name="fn2159" href="exo.htm#fnB2159"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:5)  The construction is formed with the simple imperfect in the first half, and the perfect tense with <i>vav</i> in the second half. <i>Heb</i> "[in] one moment I will go up in your midst and I will destroy you." The verse is certainly not intended to say that God was about to destroy them. That, plus the fact that he has announced he was not going in their midst, leads most commentators to take this as a conditional clause: "If I were to do such and such, then...."<br>
 <a name="fn2160" href="exo.htm#fnB2160"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:5)  The Hebrew text also has "from on you."<br>
 <a name="fn2161" href="exo.htm#fnB2161"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:5)  The form is the cohortative with a <i>vav</i> following the imperative; it therefore expresses the purpose or result: "strip off...that I may know." The call to remove the ornaments must have been perceived as a call to show true repentance for what had happened. If they repented, then God would know how to deal with them.<br>
 <a name="fn2162" href="exo.htm#fnB2162"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:5)  This last clause begins with the interrogative "what," but it is used here as an indirect interrogative. It introduces a noun clause, the object of the verb "know." <br>
 <a name="fn2163" href="exo.htm#fnB2163"><sup>16</sup></a><b>sn</b> (33:7)  This unit of the book could actually include all of chap. 33, starting with the point of the LORD's withdrawal from the people. If that section is not part of the exposition, it would have to be explained as the background. The point is that sinfulness prevents the active presence of the LORD leading his people. But then the rest of chap. 33 forms the development. In vv. 7-11 we have the gracious provision: the LORD reveals through his faithful mediator. The LORD was leading his people, but now more remotely because of their sin. Then, in vv. 12-17 Moses intercedes for the people, and the intercession of the mediator guarantees the LORD's presence. The point of all of this is that God wanted the people to come to this, to know that if he was not with them they should not go. Finally, the presence of the LORD is verified to the mediator by a special revelation (18-23). The point of the whole chapter is that by his grace the LORD renews the promise of his presence by special revelation.<br>
 <a name="fn2164" href="exo.htm#fnB2164"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:7)  <i>Heb</i> "and Moses took."<br>
 <a name="fn2165" href="exo.htm#fnB2165"><sup>18</sup></a><b>sn</b> (33:7)  The widespread contemporary view is that this section represents another source that thought the tent of meeting was already erected (see Driver, p. 359). But the better view is that this is a temporary tent used for meeting the LORD. Cassuto explains this view very well (pp. 429-30), namely, that because the building of the tabernacle was now in doubt if the LORD was not going to be in their midst, another plan seemed necessary. Moses took this tent, his tent, and put some distance between the camp and it. Here he would use the tent as the place to meet God, calling it by the same name since it was a surrogate tent. Thus, the entire section was a temporary means of meeting God, until the current wrath was past.<br>
 <a name="fn2166" href="exo.htm#fnB2166"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:7)  The infinitive absolute is used here as an adverb (see GIKC, par. 113h).<br>
 <a name="fn2167" href="exo.htm#fnB2167"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:7)  The clause begins with "and it was," the perfect tense with the <i>vav </i>conjunction. Then, the imperfect tenses in this section are customary, describing what used to happen (others describe the verbs as frequentative). See GKC &#167;107.<i>e</i>.<br>
 <a name="fn2168" href="exo.htm#fnB2168"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:7)  The form is the Piel participle. The seeking here would indicate seeking an oracle from Yahweh, or seeking to find a resolution for some difficulty (as in 2 Sam 21:1), or even perhaps with a sacrifice. Jacob reminds us that the Tent was even here a place of prayer, for the benefit of the people (p. 961). We do not know how long this location was used. <br>
 <a name="fn2169" href="exo.htm#fnB2169"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:8)  The clause is introduced again with "and it was." The perfect tense here with the <i>vav</i> is used to continue the sequence of actions that were done repeatedly in the past (see GKC &#167;112.<i>e</i>). The temporal clause is then formed with the infinitive construct of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">aXy</FONT> (<i>yasa'</i>), with "Moses" as the subjective genitive: "and it was according to the going out of Moses."<br>
 <a name="fn2170" href="exo.htm#fnB2170"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:8)  Or "rise up."<br>
 <a name="fn2171" href="exo.htm#fnB2171"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:8)  The subject of this verb is specified with the collective use of "man": "and all Israel would station themselves, each person (man) at the entrance to his tent."<br>
 <a name="fn2172" href="exo.htm#fnB2172"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:8)  The perfect tense with the <i>vav</i> continues the sequence of the customary imperfect. The people "would gaze" (after) Moses until he entered the tent.<br>
 <a name="fn2173" href="exo.htm#fnB2173"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:8)  This is a temporal clause using the infinitive construct with the suffixed subject.<br>

 <a name="fn2176" href="exo.htm#fnB2176"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:9)  Both verbs, "stand" and "speak," are perfect tenses with <i>vav</i> consecutive. <br>
 <a name="fn2177" href="exo.htm#fnB2177"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:10)  All the main verbs in this verse are perfect tenses continuing the customary sequence (see GKC &#167;112.<i>kk</i>). The idea is that they would get up (rise) when the cloud was there, and then worship, meaning in part bow down. When the cloud was not there, there was access to seek God. <br>
 <a name="fn2178" href="exo.htm#fnB2178"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:11)  "Face to face" is a noun clause that is a circumstantial clause to the action of the verb, explaining how they spoke (see GKC &#167;156.<i>c</i>). The point of this note of friendly relationship with Moses was that Moses was "at home" in this tent speaking with God. Moses would derive courage from this when he interceded for the people (Jacob, p. 966).<br>
 <a name="fn2179" href="exo.htm#fnB2179"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:11)  The imperfect in this clause is progressive imperfect.<br>

"Cause me to know" is "show me, reveal to me, teach or inform me." Moses wanted to know more of God's dealings with people, especially after all that has happened in the preceding chapter.<br>
 <a name="fn2185" href="exo.htm#fnB2185"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:13)  The imperfect tense of the verb "to know" with the <i>vav</i> follows the imperative of this root, and so this indicates the purpose clause (final imperfect): "in order that I may know you." Driver summarizes it this way: that I may understand what your nature and character is, and shape my petitions accordingly, that so I may find grace in your sight, and my future prayers may be answered (p. 361).<br>
 <a name="fn2186" href="exo.htm#fnB2186"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:13)  The purpose clause simply uses the imperfect, "that I may find." But since he already has found favor in God's eyes, he is clearly praying that it be so in the future as well as now.<br>
 <a name="fn2187" href="exo.htm#fnB2187"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:13)  The verb "see" (an imperative) is a request for God to acknowledge this Israel is his people by providing the divine leadership needed. So his main appeal will be for the people and not himself. To underscore this, he repeats "see" the way the section opened. <br>
 <a name="fn2188" href="exo.htm#fnB2188"><sup>41</sup></a><b>sn</b> (33:14)  <i>Heb</i> "my face." This represents the presence of Yahweh going with the people (see 2 Sam 17:11 for an illustration). The "presence" probably refers to the angel of the presence, or some similar manifestation of God's leading and caring for his people. <br>
 <a name="fn2189" href="exo.htm#fnB2189"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:14)  The phrase "with you" is not in the Hebrew text, but is implied.<br>
 <a name="fn2190" href="exo.htm#fnB2190"><sup>43</sup></a><b>sn</b> (33:14)  The expression certainly refers to the pace of mind and security of knowing that God was with them. But the expression came to mean "settle them in the land of promise" and give them rest and peace from their enemies. Cassuto observes how in 32:10 God had told Moses "Leave me alone" ("give me rest"), but now he promises to give them rest. The parallelism underscores the great transition through intercession (p. 434). <br>
 <a name="fn2191" href="exo.htm#fnB2191"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:15)  The construction uses the active participle to stress the continual going of the presence: if there is not your face going. <br>
 <a name="fn2192" href="exo.htm#fnB2192"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:15)  "with us" has been supplied.<br>
 <a name="fn2193" href="exo.htm#fnB2193"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:15)  <i>Heb</i> "from this."<br>
 <a name="fn2194" href="exo.htm#fnB2194"><sup>47</sup></a><b>sn</b> (33:16)  See W. Breuggemann, "The Crisis and Promise of Presence in Israel," <i>HBT</i> 1 (1979): 47-86; and N. M. Waldman, "God's Ways--A Comparative Note," <i>JQR</i> 70 (1979): 67-70. <br>
 <a name="fn2195" href="exo.htm#fnB2195"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:17)  The verb in this place is a preterite with the <i>vav</i> consecutive, judging from the pointing. It then follows in sequence the verb "you have found favor" meaning you stand in that favor, and so it means "I have known you" and still do (equal to the present perfect). The emphasis, however, is on the results of the action, and so "I know you."<br>
 <a name="fn2196" href="exo.htm#fnB2196"><sup>49</sup></a><b>sn</b> (33:18)  Moses now wants to see the glory of Yahweh, more than what he had already seen and experienced. He wanted to see God in all his majesty. The LXX chose to translate this without a word for "glory" or "honor"; instead they used the pronoun <i>seautou</i>, "yourself"--show me the real You. God tells him that he cannot see it fully, but in part. It will be enough for Moses to disclose to him to reality of the divine presence as well as God's moral nature. It would be impossible for Moses to comprehend all of the true nature of God, for there is a boundary between God and man. But God would let him see his goodness, the sum of his nature, pass by in a flash. Jacob says that the glory refers to God's majesty, might, and glory, as manifested in nature, in his providence, his laws, and his judgments. He adds that this glory should and would be made visible to man--that was its purpose in the world (p. 972). <br>
 <a name="fn2197" href="exo.htm#fnB2197"><sup>50</sup></a><b>sn</b> (33:19)  The word "goodness" refers to the divine appearance in summary fashion. McNeile says, "It is to be a spectacle of outward beauty as a visible sign of His moral perfection."<br>
 <a name="fn2198" href="exo.htm#fnB2198"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:19)  The expression "make proclamation in the name of Yahweh" (here the perfect tense with the <i>vav</i> consecutive for future) means to declare, reveal, or otherwise make proclamation of who Yahweh is. The "name of Yahweh" (rendered "the name of the LORD" throughout) refers to his divine attributes revealed to his people, either in word or deed. What will be focused on first will be his grace and compassion.<br>
 <a name="fn2199" href="exo.htm#fnB2199"><sup>52</sup></a><b>sn</b> (33:19)  God declares his mercy and grace in similar terms to his self revelation ("I am that I am"): "I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious." In other words, the grace and mercy of God is bound up in his own will. Obviously, in this passage the recipients of that favor are the penitent Israelites who were forgiven through Moses' intercession. The two words are at the heart of God's dealings with people. The first is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/nj</FONT> (<i>hanan</i>), "to be gracious, show favor." It means to grant favor or grace to someone, grace meaning unmerited favor. All of God's dealings are gracious, but especially in forgiving sins and granting salvation do we find it so critical. Parallel to this is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;jr</FONT> (<i>raham</i>), a word that means "show compassion, tender mercy." It is a word that is related to the noun "womb," the connection being in providing care and protection for that which is helpless and dependent--a motherly quality. In both of these constructions the verbs simply express what God will do, without explaining why. See further, J. R. Lundbom, "God's Use of the <i>Idem per idem</i> to Terminate Debate," <i>HTR</i> 71 (1978): 193-201; and J. Piper, "Prolegomena to Understanding Romans 9:14-15: An Interpretation of Exodus 33:19," <i>JETS </i>22 (1979): 203-16. <br>
 <a name="fn2200" href="exo.htm#fnB2200"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:20)  In view of the use of the verb "can, be able to" in the first clause, this imperfect tense is thereby given a potential nuance for the imperfect.<br>
 <a name="fn2201" href="exo.htm#fnB2201"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:20)  Gesenius notes that sometimes a negative statement takes the place of a conditional clause; here it is equal to "if a man sees me he does not live" (GKC &#167;159.<i>gg</i>). The other passages that teach this are Gen 32:30; Deut 4:33, 5:24, 26; Judg 6:22, 13:22, and Isa 6:5.<br>
 <a name="fn2202" href="exo.htm#fnB2202"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:21)  The deictic particle is used here simply to call attention to a place of God's knowing and choosing.<br>
 <a name="fn2203" href="exo.htm#fnB2203"><sup>56</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:21)  <i>Heb</i> "and you will," or interpretively, "where you will."<br>
 <a name="fn2204" href="exo.htm#fnB2204"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:22)  The construction uses the temporal indicator for the future, the preposition of time on the infinitive construct, and the subjective genitive, the subject of the clause-- "my glory." <br>
 <a name="fn2205" href="exo.htm#fnB2205"><sup>58</sup></a><b>sn</b> (33:22)  Note the use in Exod 40:3, "and you will <i>screen</i> the ark with the veil." The glory is covered, veiled from being seen. <br>
 <a name="fn2206" href="exo.htm#fnB2206"><sup>59</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:22)  The circumstantial clause is simply, "my hand [being] over you." This protecting hand of Yahweh represents a fairly common theme in the Bible.<br>
 <a name="fn2207" href="exo.htm#fnB2207"><sup>60</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:22)  The construction is the preposition with the infinitive construct with a suffix: "while [or until] I pass by" (<i>Heb</i> "the passing by of me").<br>
 <a name="fn2208" href="exo.htm#fnB2208"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:23)  The plural "my backs" is according to Gesenius an extension plural. The word denotes a locality in general, but that is composed of numerous parts (see GKC &#167;124.<i>b</i>). Kaiser says that since God is a spirit, the meaning of this word could just as easily be rendered "after effects" of his presence (p. 484). As Driver says, though, while this may indicate just the "afterglow" which he leaves behind him, it was enough to suggest what the full brilliancy of his presence must be (see also Job 26:14; Driver, p. 363).<br>
 <a name="fn2209" href="exo.htm#fnB2209"><sup>62</sup></a><b>tn</b> (33:23)  The Niphal imperfect could simply be rendered "will not be seen"; but given the emphasis of the preceding verses, it is more binding than that, and so a negated obligatory imperfect fits better: "it must not be seen." It would also be possible to render it with a potential imperfect tense: "it cannot be seen."<br>
 <a name="fn2210" href="exo.htm#fnB2210"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (34:1)  The restoration of the faltering community continues in this chapter. First, Moses is instructed to make new tablets and take them to the mount (1-4). Then, through the promised theophany God proclaims his moral character (5-8). Moses responds with the reiteration of the intercession (8), and God responds with the renewal of the covenant (10-28). To put these into expository form, as principles, the chapter would run as follows: I. God provides for spiritual renewal (1-4), II. God reminds people of his moral standard (5-9), III. God renews his covenant promises and stipulations (10-28). <br>
 <a name="fn2211" href="exo.htm#fnB2211"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:1)  The imperative is followed by the preposition with a suffix expressing the ethical dative; it strengthens the instruction for Moses. Interestingly, the verb "cut out, chisel, hew," is the same verb from which the word for a "graven image" is derived--<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lsP</FONT>, <i>pasal</i>.<br>
 <a name="fn2212" href="exo.htm#fnB2212"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:1)  The perfect tense with the <i>vav</i> consecutive makes the value of this verb equal to an imperfect tense, probably a simple future here. <br>
 <b>sn</b> (34:1)  Nothing is said of how God was going to write on these stone tablets at this point, but in the end it is Moses who wrote the words. This is not considered a contradiction, since God is often credited with things he has people do in his place. There is great symbolism in this command--if ever a command said far more than it actually said, this is it. The instruction means that the covenant had been renewed. Or was going to be renewed, and that the sanctuary with the tablets in the ark at its center would be built (see Deut 10:1). The first time Moses went up he was empty-handed; when he came down he smashed the tablets because of their sin. Now the people would see him go up with empty tablets, and be uncertain whether he would come back with the tablets inscribed again (Jacob, 977-78).<br>
 <a name="fn2213" href="exo.htm#fnB2213"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:2)  The form is the Niphal participle of the hollow verb; it means "be prepared, be ready." This probably means that Moses was to do in preparation what the congregation had to do back in Exod 19:11-15. <br>
 <a name="fn2214" href="exo.htm#fnB2214"><sup>5</sup></a><b>sn</b> (34:2)  The same word is used in Exod 33:21. It is as if Moses was to be at his post when Yahweh wanted to communicate to him.<br>
 <a name="fn2215" href="exo.htm#fnB2215"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:4)  <i>Heb</i> "he"; the referent has been specified here and the name "Moses," which occurs later in this verse, has been replaced with the pronoun ("he"), both for stylistic reasons.<br>
 <a name="fn2216" href="exo.htm#fnB2216"><sup>7</sup></a><b>sn</b> (34:4)  Driver thinks that there is a discrepancy that shows sources here. Deuteronomy says that Moses was also to make an ark of acacia wood before the tablets, apparently to put the tablets in until the sanctuary was built. But this ark may not have been the ark built later; or, it might be the wood box, but Bezalel still had to do all the golden work with it. <br>
 <a name="fn2217" href="exo.htm#fnB2217"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:4)  The line reads "and Moses got up early in the morning and went up." These verbs likely form a verbal hendiadys, the first one with its prepositional phrase serving in an adverbial sense.<br>
 <a name="fn2218" href="exo.htm#fnB2218"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:5)  Some commentaries wish to make Moses the subject of the second and the third verbs, the first because he was told to stand there and this verb suggests he did it, and the last because it sounds like he was worshiping Yahweh. But it is clear that from v. 6 we learn that Yahweh was the subject of the last clause of v. 5--v. 6 tells how he did it. So if Yahweh is the subject of the first and last clauses of v. 5, it seems simpler that he also be the subject of the second. Moses took his stand there, but God stood by him (Jacob, p. 981; and Cassuto, p. 439). There is no reason to make Moses the subject in any of the verbs of v. 5.<br>
 <a name="fn2219" href="exo.htm#fnB2219"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:6)  Here is one of the clearest examples of what it means "to call on the name of Yahweh" as the clause has been translated traditionally (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hw&#180;hy+ &lt;v@b= ar*q=Y]w~</FONT> [<i>wayyiqra' b<sup>e</sup>sem YHWH</i>]). It seems more likely that it means "to make proclamation of Yahweh by name." Here we are told that Yahweh came down and made proclamation--and the next verses give the content of what he said. This cannot be prayer, or praise; it is a proclamation of the nature or attributes of God (which is what his "name" means throughout the Bible). Attempts to make Moses the subject of the verb are awkward, for the verb is repeated in v. 6 with Yahweh clearly doing the proclaiming.<br>
 <a name="fn2220" href="exo.htm#fnB2220"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (34:6)  Cassuto suggests that these two names be written as a sentence: "Yahweh, He is Yahweh." In this manner it reflects "I am that I am." It is impossible to define his name in any other way than to make this affirmation and then show what it means (p. 439).<br>
 <a name="fn2221" href="exo.htm#fnB2221"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:6)  See Exod 33:19.<br>
 <a name="fn2222" href="exo.htm#fnB2222"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (34:6)  This is literally "long of anger." His anger prolongs itself, allowing for people to repent before the punishment is inflicted. <br>
 <a name="fn2223" href="exo.htm#fnB2223"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (34:6)  These two words ("loyal love" and "truth") are often found together, and occasionally in a hendiadys construction. If that is the interpretation here, then it means "faithful covenant love." Even if they are left separate, they are dual elements of a single quality. The first word is God's faithful covenant love; the second word is God's reliability and faithfulness. <br>
 <a name="fn2224" href="exo.htm#fnB2224"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:7)  I.e., "for thousands of generations."<br>
 <a name="fn2225" href="exo.htm#fnB2225"><sup>16</sup></a><b>sn</b> (34:7)  As in the ten commandments, this expression shows that the iniquity and its punishment will continue in the family if left unchecked. This does not go on as long as the good; and it is limited to those who hate God. <br>
 <a name="fn2226" href="exo.htm#fnB2226"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:8)  The first two verbs form a hendiadys: "he hurried...he bowed," meaning "he quickly bowed down."<br>
 <a name="fn2227" href="exo.htm#fnB2227"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:9)  The Hebrew term translated "Lord" two times here is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yn&#180;d{a&amp;</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a&amp;d{n&#180;y</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn2228" href="exo.htm#fnB2228"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:10)  Here again is a use of the <i>futur instans</i> participle; the deictic particle plus the pronoun precedes the participle, showing what is going to happen, what is about to happen.<br>
 <a name="fn2229" href="exo.htm#fnB2229"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:10)  The verb used here is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">arB</FONT> (<i>bara'</i>), "to create." The choice of this verb is to stress that these wonders would be supernaturally performed, for the verb is used only with God as the subject.<br>
 <a name="fn2230" href="exo.htm#fnB2230"><sup>21</sup></a><b>sn</b> (34:10)  The idea is that God will be doing awesome things in dealing with them, i.e., to fulfill his program. <br>
 <a name="fn2231" href="exo.htm#fnB2231"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:11)  The covenant duties begin with this command to "keep well" what is being commanded. The expression is "keep for you"; the suffix and the preposition form the ethical dative, adding strength to the imperative.<br>
 <a name="fn2232" href="exo.htm#fnB2232"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:11)  Again, this is the <i>futur instans</i> use of the participle.<br>
 <a name="fn2233" href="exo.htm#fnB2233"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:12)  The exact expression is "take heed to yourself lest you make." It is the second use of this verb in the duties, now in the Niphal stem. To take heed to yourself means to watch yourself, be sure not to do something. Here, if they do not do this, they would end up making entangling treaties.<br>
 <a name="fn2234" href="exo.htm#fnB2234"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (34:12)  A snare would be a trap, an allurement to ruin. See Exod 23:33. <br>
 <a name="fn2235" href="exo.htm#fnB2235"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (34:13)  The <i>Asherah poles</i> were some kind of cultic object named after Asherah, a Canaanite deity. The poles seemed to be connected with a fertility ritual. <br>
 <a name="fn2236" href="exo.htm#fnB2236"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:14)  <i>Heb</i> "bow down."<br>
 <a name="fn2237" href="exo.htm#fnB2237"><sup>28</sup></a><b>sn</b> (34:14)  In Exod 20:3 it was "gods." <br>
 <a name="fn2238" href="exo.htm#fnB2238"><sup>29</sup></a><b>sn</b> (34:14)  Here, too, the emphasis on God's being a jealous God is repeated (see Exod 20:5). The use of "name" here is to stress that this is his nature, his character. <br>
 <a name="fn2239" href="exo.htm#fnB2239"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:15)  The sentence begins simply "lest you make a covenant"; it is undoubtedly a continuation of the imperative introduced earlier, and so that is supplied here.<br>
 <a name="fn2240" href="exo.htm#fnB2240"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:15)  The verb is the perfect tense with a <i>vav</i> consecutive. In the literal form of the sentence, this clause tells what might happen if the people made a covenant with the inhabitants of the land: "Taken heed...lest you make a covenant...and then they prostitute themselves...and sacrifice...and invite...and you eat." The sequence lays out an entire scenario.<br>
 <a name="fn2241" href="exo.htm#fnB2241"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:15)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hnz</FONT> (<i>zana</i>) means "to play the prostitute; to commit whoredom; to be a harlot" or something similar. It is used here and in the Bible for departing from pure religion and engaging in pagan religion. The use of the word in that figurative sense is fitting, because the relationship between God and his people is pictured as a marriage, and to be unfaithful to it was a sin. This is also why God is described as a "jealous" or "impassioned" God. The figure may not be merely a metaphorical use, but perhaps a metonymy, since there actually was fornication at the Canaanite altars and poles.<br>
 <a name="fn2242" href="exo.htm#fnB2242"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:15)  There is no subject for the verb. It could be rendered "and one invites you," or it could be made a passive.<br>
 <a name="fn2243" href="exo.htm#fnB2243"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:16)  In the construction this verb would follow as a possible outcome of the last event, and so remain in the verbal sequence.

 <b>sn</b> (34:23)  The title "Lord" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">h*a*d{/</FONT>) is included here before the divine Name (translated "GOD" here; see Exod 23:17), perhaps to form a contrast with Baal (which means "lord" as well) and to show the sovereignty of Yahweh. But the distinct designation "the God of Israel" is certainly the point of the renewed covenant relationship. <br>
 <a name="fn2261" href="exo.htm#fnB2261"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:24)  The verb is the Hiphil imperfect of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vry</FONT> (<i>yaras</i>), which meabs "to possess." In the causative stem it can mean "dispossess" or "drive out."<br>
 <a name="fn2262" href="exo.htm#fnB2262"><sup>53</sup></a><b>sn</b> (34:24)  The verb "covet" means more than desire; it means that some action will be taken to try to acquire the land that is being coveted. It is one thing to envy someone for their land; it is another to be consumed by the desire that stops at nothing to get it (it, not something like it).<br>
 <a name="fn2263" href="exo.htm#fnB2263"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:24)  The construction uses the infinitive construct with a preposition and a suffixed subject to form the temporal clause.<br>

 <a name="fn2269" href="exo.htm#fnB2269"><sup>60</sup></a><b>sn</b> (34:29)  Now, at the culmination of the renewing of the covenant, we have the account of Moses' shining face. It is important to read this in its context first, holding off on the connection to Paul's midrash in 2 Corinthians. There is a delicate balance here in Exodus. On the one hand Moses' shining face served to authenticate the message, but on the other hand Moses prevented the people from seeing more than they could handle. The subject matter in the OT, then, is how to authenticate the message. The section again can be subdivided into three points that develop the whole idea. In the passage we have: I. The one who spends time with God reflects his glory (29,30). It will not always be as Moses; rather, the glory of the LORD is reflected differently today, but nonetheless reflected. II. The glory of Yahweh authenticates the message (31,32). III. The authentication of the message must be used cautiously with the weak and immature (33-35).<br>
 <a name="fn2270" href="exo.htm#fnB2270"><sup>61</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:29)  The temporal clause is composed of the temporal indicator ("and it happened") with the infinitive construct following the temporal preposition, and then the subjective genitive ("Moses").<br>
 <a name="fn2271" href="exo.htm#fnB2271"><sup>62</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:29)  The second clause begins with "and/now"; it is a circumstantial clause explaining that the tablets were in his hand. It repeats the temporal clause at the end.<br>

 <a name="fn2273" href="exo.htm#fnB2273"><sup>64</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:29)  The temporal clause parallels the first temporal clause; it uses the same infinitive construct, but now with a suffix referring to Moses.<br>

Something of the divine glory remained with Moses. The Greek translation of Aquila and the Latin Vulgate reflect the idea that he had horns, the primary meaning of the word from which this word is derived. Some have tried to defend this view saying that the glory appeared like horns, or that Moses covered his face with a mask adorned with horns. But in the text the subject of the verb is the skin of Moses' face (see Cassuto, p. 449).<br>
 <a name="fn2276" href="exo.htm#fnB2276"><sup>67</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:30)  This clause is introduced by the deictic particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hN@h!</FONT> (<i>hinneh</i>); it has the forced of pointing to something surprising or sudden.<br>

 <a name="fn2282" href="exo.htm#fnB2282"><sup>73</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:34)  The form is the Pual imperfect; but since the context demands a past tense here, in fact a past perfect tense, this is probably an old preterite form without a <i>vav</i> consecutive.<br>
 <a name="fn2283" href="exo.htm#fnB2283"><sup>74</sup></a><b>tn</b> (34:35)  Now the perfect tense with the <i>vav</i> consecutive is subordinated to the next clause, "Moses returned the veil...."<br>

 <a name="fn2290" href="exo.htm#fnB2290"><sup>5</sup></a><b>sn</b> (35:3)  Kindling a fire receives special attention here because the people thought that kindling a fire was not a work, but only a preparation for some kind of work. But the Law makes sure that this too was not done. But see also G. Robinson, "The Prohibition of Strange Fire in Ancient Israel: A Look at the Case of Gathering Wood and Kindling Fire on the Sabbath," <i>VT</i> 28 (1978): 301-317.<br>

 <a name="fn2292" href="exo.htm#fnB2292"><sup>7</sup></a><b>sn</b> (35:3)  The presence of these three verses in this place has raised all kinds of questions. It may be that after the renewal of the covenant the people needed a reminder to obey God, and obeying the sign of the covenant was the starting point. But there is more to it than this; it is part of the narrative design of the book. It is the artistic design that puts the filling of the Spirit section (31:1-11) prior to the sabbath laws (31:12-18) before the idolatry section, and then after the renewal there is the sabbath reminder (35:1-3) before the filling of the Spirit material (35:4-36:7). <br>
 <a name="fn2293" href="exo.htm#fnB2293"><sup>8</sup></a><b>sn</b> (35:4)  The book now turns to record how all the work of the sanctuary was done. This next unit picks up on the ideas in Exod 31:1-11. But it adds several features. The first part is the instruction of God for all people to give willingly (35:4-19); the next section tells how the faithful brought an offering for the service of the tabernacle (35:20-29); and the next section tells how God set some apart with special gifts (35:30-35), and finally, the narrative reports how the faithful people of God enthusiastically began the work (36:1-7). <br>
 <a name="fn2294" href="exo.htm#fnB2294"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:5)  <i>Heb</i> "from with you."<br>
 <a name="fn2295" href="exo.htm#fnB2295"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:5)  "Heart" is a genitive of specification, clarifying in what way they might be "willing." The heart refers to their will, their choices.<br>
 <a name="fn2296" href="exo.htm#fnB2296"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:5)  The verb has a suffix that is the direct object; but the suffixed object is qualified by the second accusative: "let him bring it, an offering."<br>
 <a name="fn2297" href="exo.htm#fnB2297"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:5)  The phrase is literally "the offering of Yahweh"; it could be a simple possessive, "Yahweh's offering," but a genitive the indicates the indirect object is more appropriate.<br>
 <a name="fn2298" href="exo.htm#fnB2298"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:7)  See the note on this phrase in Exod 25:5.<br>

 <a name="fn2301" href="exo.htm#fnB2301"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:10)  The construction is "wise of heart"; here also "heart" would be a genitive of specification, showing that there were those who could make skillful decisions. <br>
 <a name="fn2302" href="exo.htm#fnB2302"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:11)  <i>Heb</i> "and." In Hebrew style all these items are typically connected with a <i>vav</i> conjunction, but English typically uses commas except between the last two items in a series or between items in a series that are somehow related to one another.

 <a name="fn2309" href="exo.htm#fnB2309"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:21)  The verb means "lift up, bear, carry." Here the subject is "heart" or will, and so the expression describes one moved within to act. <br>
 <a name="fn2310" href="exo.htm#fnB2310"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:21)  The clause includes "his spirit made him willing." The verb is used in Scripture for the freewill offering that people brought (Lev 7). <br>
 <a name="fn2311" href="exo.htm#fnB2311"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:21)  Literally "the garments of holiness," the genitive is the attributive genitive, marking out what type of garments these were.<br>
 <a name="fn2312" href="exo.htm#fnB2312"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:22)  The expression in Hebrew is "men on/after the women," meaning men with women, to ensure that it was clear that the preceding verse did not mean only men. Jacob takes it further, saying that the men came after the women because the latter had taken the initiative (p. 1017).<br>
 <a name="fn2313" href="exo.htm#fnB2313"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:22)  <i>Heb</i> "all gold utensils."<br>
 <a name="fn2314" href="exo.htm#fnB2314"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:22)  The verb could be translated "offered," but it is cognate with the following noun that is the wave offering. This sentence underscores the freewill nature of the offerings people made.<br>
 <a name="fn2315" href="exo.htm#fnB2315"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:23)  The text uses a relative clause with a resumptive pronoun for this: "who was found with him," meaning "with whom was found."<br>
 <a name="fn2316" href="exo.htm#fnB2316"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:23)  The conjunction here is translated "or" because the sentence does not intend to say that each person had all these things. They brought what they had. <br>
 <a name="fn2317" href="exo.htm#fnB2317"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:23)  See the note on this phrase in Exod 25:5.<br>
 <a name="fn2318" href="exo.htm#fnB2318"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:23)  Here "them" has been supplied.<br>
 <a name="fn2319" href="exo.htm#fnB2319"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:24)  This translation takes "offering" as an adverbial accusative explaining the form or purpose of their bringing things. It could also be rendered as the direct object, but that would seem to repeat without as much difference what had just been said.<br>
 <a name="fn2320" href="exo.htm#fnB2320"><sup>35</sup></a><b>sn</b> (35:24)  Cassuto notes that the expression "with whom was found" does not rule out the idea that these folks went out and cut down acacia trees (p. 458). It is unlikely that they had a good deal of wood in their tents. <br>
 <a name="fn2321" href="exo.htm#fnB2321"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:24)  Here "it" has been supplied.<br>
 <a name="fn2322" href="exo.htm#fnB2322"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:25)  Here too the text has "wisdom of heart," which means that they were skilled and could make all the right choices about the work.<br>
 <a name="fn2323" href="exo.htm#fnB2323"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:26)  The text simply uses a prepositional phrase, "with/in wisdom." It seems to be qualifying "the women" as the relative clause is.<br>
 <a name="fn2324" href="exo.htm#fnB2324"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:27)  <i>Heb</i> "and stones of the filling."<br>

 <a name="fn2329" href="exo.htm#fnB2329"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:33)  <i>Heb</i> "in every work of thought," meaning, every work that required the implementation of design or plan.<br>
 <a name="fn2330" href="exo.htm#fnB2330"><sup>45</sup></a><b>sn</b> (35:34)  The expression means that God has given them the ability and the desire to teach others how to do the work. The infinitive construct "to teach" is related to the word Torah, "instruction, guide, law." They will be able "to direct" others in the work.<br>
 <a name="fn2331" href="exo.htm#fnB2331"><sup>46</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:35)  The expression "wisdom of heart," or "wisdom in heart," means artistic skill. The decisions and plans they make are skilled. The expression forms a second accusative after the verb of filling. <br>
 <a name="fn2332" href="exo.htm#fnB2332"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn</b> (35:35)  The expression "all the work" means "all kinds of work."<br>

 <a name="fn2339" href="exo.htm#fnB2339"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:1)  The relative clause includes this infinitive clause that expresses either the purpose or the result of God's giving wisdom and understanding to these folk.<br>
 <a name="fn2340" href="exo.htm#fnB2340"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:1)  This noun is usually given an interpretive translation. Jacob renders the bound relationship as "the holy task" or "the sacred task" (p. 1019). The NIV makes it "constructing," so read "the work of constructing the sanctuary."<br>
 <a name="fn2341" href="exo.htm#fnB2341"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:1)  The first word of the verse is the perfect tense with the <i>vav</i> consecutive; it is singular because it agrees with the first of the compound subject. The sentence is a little cumbersome because of the extended relative clause in the middle.<br>
 <a name="fn2342" href="exo.htm#fnB2342"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:2)  The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">arq</FONT> (<i>qara'</i>) plus the preposition "to"-- "to call to" someone, means "to summon" that person.<br>
 <a name="fn2343" href="exo.htm#fnB2343"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:2)  Here there is a slight change: "in whose heart Yahweh had put skill."<br>
 <a name="fn2344" href="exo.htm#fnB2344"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:2)  Or "was willing."<br>
 <a name="fn2345" href="exo.htm#fnB2345"><sup>10</sup></a><b>sn</b> (36:2)  The verb means more than "approach" or "draw near"; <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">brq</FONT> (<i>qarab</i>) is the word used for drawing near the altar as in bringing an offering. Here they offer themselves, their talents and their time. <br>
 <a name="fn2346" href="exo.htm#fnB2346"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:3)  In the Hebrew text the infinitive "to do it" comes after "sanctuary"; it makes a smoother rendering to place it here in place of reading "brought <i>for</i> the work."<br>
 <a name="fn2347" href="exo.htm#fnB2347"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:3)  <i>Heb</i> "in the morning, in the morning."<br>

 <a name="fn2349" href="exo.htm#fnB2349"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:5)  The construction uses the verbal hendiadys: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ayb!h*l= &lt;yB!r+m^</FONT> (<i>marbim l<sup>e</sup>habi'</i>) is the Hiphil participle followed (after the subject) by the Hiphil<i> </i>infinitive construct. It would read, "they multiply...to bring," meaning, "they brink more" than is needed.<br>
 <a name="fn2350" href="exo.htm#fnB2350"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:5)  The last clause is merely the infinitive with an object-- "to do it." It clearly means the skilled workers are to do it.<br>
 <a name="fn2351" href="exo.htm#fnB2351"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:6)  <i>Heb</i> "and Moses."<br>
 <a name="fn2352" href="exo.htm#fnB2352"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:6)  The verse simply reads, "and Moses commanded and they caused [a voice] to cross over in the camp." The second preterite with the <i>vav</i> may be subordinated to the first clause, giving the intent (purpose or result). <br>
 <a name="fn2353" href="exo.htm#fnB2353"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:6)  <i>Heb</i> "voice."<br>
 <a name="fn2354" href="exo.htm#fnB2354"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:6)  The verse ends with the infinitive serving as the object of the preposition: "from bringing." <br>
 <a name="fn2355" href="exo.htm#fnB2355"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:7)  This part of the sentence comes from the final verb, the Hiphil infinitive--leave over, meaning, have more than enough (see BDB, p. 451).<br>
 <a name="fn2356" href="exo.htm#fnB2356"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:7)  <i>Heb</i> "for all the work, to do it."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (36:7)  This lengthy section (35:1-36:7) forms one of the most remarkable sections in the book. Here there is a mixture of God's preparation of people to do the work and their willingness to give and to serve. It not only provides an inside into this renewed community of believers, but it also provides a timeless message for the church. The point is clear enough: In response to God's commission, and inspired by God's Spirit, the faithful and willing people rally to support and participate in the LORD's work. <br>
 <a name="fn2357" href="exo.htm#fnB2357"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:8)  The verse ends with "he made them" or "one made them." Since there is no formal subject here, the verb may be taken as a passive. And although it means "he made," it is referring to the weaving in of cherubim by design.<br>
 <a name="fn2358" href="exo.htm#fnB2358"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (36:9)  <i>Heb</i> "one measure for every curtain." <br>

But the word often has the idea of "numbering" or "appointing" as well. Here it is an accounting or enumeration of the materials that people brought, so the contemporary term "inventory" is a close approximation. By using this Hebrew word there is also the indication that whatever was given, i.e., appointed for the tabernacle, was changed forever in its use. This is consistent with this Hebrew root, which does have a sense of changing the destiny of someone ("God will surely visit you"). The list in this section will also be tied to the numbering of the people.<br>
