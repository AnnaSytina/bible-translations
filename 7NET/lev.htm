<bqverse 22>22  Then he presented the second ram, the ram of ordination,<a name="fnB315" href="lev_note.htm#fn315"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram 
<bqverse 23>23  and he slaughtered it.<a name="fnB316" href="lev_note.htm#fn316"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> Moses then took some of its blood and put it on Aaron's right earlobe,<a name="fnB317" href="lev_note.htm#fn317"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe<a name="fnB318" href="lev_note.htm#fn318"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> of his right foot. 
<bqverse 24>24  Next he brought the sons of Aaron forward, and Moses put some of the blood on their right earlobes, on their right thumbs, and on the big toes of their right feet, and Moses splashed the rest of the blood all around on the altar.<p>

<bqverse 25>25  Then he took the fat--the fatty tail,<a name="fnB319" href="lev_note.htm#fn319"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> all the fat that was on the entrails, the protruding lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat<a name="fnB320" href="lev_note.htm#fn320"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a>--and the right thigh,<a name="fnB321" href="lev_note.htm#fn321"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  and from the basket of unleavened bread that was before the LORD he took one unleavened loaf, one loaf of bread mixed with olive oil, and one wafer,<a name="fnB322" href="lev_note.htm#fn322"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> and placed them on the fat parts and on the right thigh. 
<bqverse 27>27  He then put the whole thing on the palms<a name="fnB323" href="lev_note.htm#fn323"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> of Aaron and his sons, and he waved<a name="fnB324" href="lev_note.htm#fn324"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> them as a wave offering before the LORD.<a name="fnB325" href="lev_note.htm#fn325"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  Moses then took them from their palms and offered them up in smoke on the altar<a name="fnB326" href="lev_note.htm#fn326"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> on top of the burnt offering--they were an ordination offering for a soothing aroma; it was a gift to the LORD. 
<bqverse 29>29  Finally, Moses took the breast and waved it as a wave offering before the LORD from the ram of ordination. It was Moses' share just as the LORD had commanded Moses. <a name="_Toc494011398"></a></p>
<p><i>Anointing Aaron, his Sons, and their Garments </i>
<p>
<bqverse 30>30  Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron and his garments, and on his sons and his sons' garments with him. So he consecrated Aaron, his garments, and his sons and his sons' garments with him. 
<bqverse 31>31  And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, "Boil the meat at the doorway of the tent of meeting, and there you are to eat it and the bread which is in the ordination offering basket, just as I have commanded<a name="fnB327" href="lev_note.htm#fn327"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> saying, `Aaron and his sons are to eat it,'

<bqverse 33>33  And you must not go out from the doorway of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the day of the fulfillment of your days of ordination, because you must be ordained seven days.<a name="fnB329" href="lev_note.htm#fn329"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 34>34  What has been done<a name="fnB330" href="lev_note.htm#fn330"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> on this day the LORD has commanded to be done<a name="fnB331" href="lev_note.htm#fn331"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> to make atonement for you. 
<bqverse 35>35  You must live at the doorway of the tent of meeting day and night for seven days and keep the charge of the LORD so that you will not die, for this is what I have been commanded." 
<bqverse 36>36  So Aaron and his sons did all the things the LORD had commanded by the hand of Moses.

<p><i>The Sin Offering for the Priests</i>
<p>
<bqverse 8>8  So Aaron approached the altar and slaughtered the sin offering calf which was for himself. 
<bqverse 9>9  Then the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar, and the rest of the blood he poured out at the base of the altar.

<p><i>The Offerings for the People </i>
<p>
<bqverse 15>15  Then he presented the people's offering.

<bqverse 17>17  Next he presented the grain offering, filled his hand with some of it, and offered it up in smoke on the altar in addition to the morning burnt offering.<a name="fnB350" href="lev_note.htm#fn350"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 21>21  Finally Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh as a wave offering before the LORD just as Moses had commanded.<p>

<bqverse 22>22  Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them and descended from making the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offering. 
<bqverse 23>23 Moses and Aaron then entered into the tent of meeting and went out and blessed the people, and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people. 
<bqverse 24>24  Then fire went out from the presence of the LORD<a name="fnB355" href="lev_note.htm#fn355"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> and consumed the burnt offering and the fat parts on the altar, and all the people saw it, so they shouted loudly and fell down with their faces to the ground.<a name="fnB356" href="lev_note.htm#fn356"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 2>2  So fire went out from the presence of the LORD<a name="fnB359" href="lev_note.htm#fn359"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> and consumed them so that they died before the LORD. 
<bqverse 3>3  Moses then said to Aaron, "This is what the LORD spoke: `Among the ones close to me I will show myself holy,<a name="fnB360" href="lev_note.htm#fn360"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> and in the presence of all the people I will be honored.'"<a name="fnB361" href="lev_note.htm#fn361"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> So Aaron kept silent. 
<bqverse 4>4  Moses then called to Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel, Aaron's uncle, and said to them, "Come near, carry your brothers away from the front of the sanctuary to a place outside the camp." 
<bqverse 5>5  So they came near and carried them away in their tunics to a place outside the camp just as Moses had spoken. 
<bqverse 6>6  Then Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar his other two sons, "Do not<a name="fnB362" href="lev_note.htm#fn362"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> dishevel the hair of your heads;<a name="fnB363" href="lev_note.htm#fn363"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> and do not tear your garments, so that you do not die and so that wrath does not come on the whole congregation.

<bqverse 12>12  Then Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his remaining sons, "Take the grain offering which remains from the gifts of the LORD and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for it is most holy.

<p><i>The Problem with the Inaugural Sin Offering </i>

<bqverse 17>17  "Why did you not eat the sin offering in the holy place?
