 <a name="fn3" href="2ki.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:2)  Apparently <i>Baal Zebub</i> refers to a local manifestation of the god Baal at the Philistine city of Ekron. The name appears to mean "Lord of the Flies," but it may be a deliberate scribal corruption of Baal Zebul, "Baal, the Prince," a title known from the Ugaritic texts. For further discussion and bibliography, see <i>HALOT</i> 261 and Cogan and Tadmor, <i>II Kings</i>, 25. <br>
 <a name="fn4" href="2ki.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  <i>Heb</i> "Is it because there is no God in Israel [that] you are going to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?" The translation seeks to bring out the sarcastic tone of the rhetorical question.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (1:5)  The narrative is elliptical and telescoped here. The account of Elijah encountering the messengers and delivering the Lord's message is omitted; we only here of it as the messengers report what happened to the king. <br>

The translation seeks to bring out the sarcastic tone of the rhetorical question. In v. 3 the messengers are addressed (in the phrase "you are on your way" the second person plural pronoun is used in Hebrew), but here the king is addressed (in the phrase "you are sending" the second person singular pronoun is used). <br>

For other examples where the idiom "owner of" is used to describe a characteristic of someone, see <i>HALOT</i> 143. For example, an "owner of dreams" is one who frequently has dreams (Gen 37:19) and an "owner of anger" is a hot-tempered individual (Prov 22:24). <br>

 <a name="fn19" href="2ki.htm#fnB19"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  Wordplay contributes to the irony here. The king tells Elijah to "come down" (Hebrew <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dry</FONT>), but Elijah calls fire down (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dry</FONT>) on the arrogant king's officer.<br>

 <a name="fn22" href="2ki.htm#fnB22"><sup>23</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:11)  In this second panel of the three-paneled narrative, the king and his captain are more arrogant than before.

 <a name="fn23" href="2ki.htm#fnB23"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:12)  Two medieval Hebrew MSS, the LXX, and the Syriac Peshitta have the singular "to him."<br>
 <a name="fn24" href="2ki.htm#fnB24"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:12)  Or "intense fire." The divine name may be used idiomatically to emphasize the intensity of the fire. Whether one translates <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yhla</FONT> here as a proper name or idiomatically, this addition to the narrative (the name is omitted in the first panel, v. 10b) emphasizes the severity of the judgment and is appropriate given the more intense command delivered by the king to the prophet in this panel.<br>

The moral of the story seems clear: Those who act as if they have authority over God and his servants just may pay for their arrogance with their lives; those who, like the third commander, humble themselves and show the proper respect for God's authority and for his servants will be spared and find God quite cooperative.<br>

The repetition emphasizes one of the chapter's main themes.

 <a name="fn48" href="2ki.htm#fnB48"><sup>12</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:12)  Elisha may be referring to the fiery chariot(s) and horses as the Lord's spiritual army that fights on behalf of Israel (see 2 Kgs 6:15-17; 7:6). However, the juxtaposition with "my father" (clearly a reference to Elijah as Elisha's mentor), and the parallel in 2 Kgs 13:14 (where the king addresses Elisha with these words), suggest that Elisha is referring to Elijah. In this case Elijah is viewed as a one man army, as it were. When the Lord spoke through him, his prophetic word was as powerful as an army of chariots and horses. See M. A. Beek, "The Meaning of the Expression `The Chariots and Horsemen of Israel' (II Kings ii 12)," <i>OTS</i> 17 (1972): 1-10. <br>
 <a name="fn49" href="2ki.htm#fnB49"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:14)  <i>Heb</i> "Elijah's robe, which had fallen off him." The wording is changed slightly in the translation for the sake of variety of expression (see v. 13).<br>

 <a name="fn59" href="2ki.htm#fnB59"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:23)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">run</FONT>, here translated "boy," can refer to a broad age range, including infants as well as young men. But the qualifying term "young" (or "small") suggests these youths were relatively young. The phrase in question ("young boy") occurs elsewhere in 1 Sam 20:35; 1 Kgs 3:7 (used by Solomon in an hyperbolic manner); 11:17; 2 Kgs 5:14; and Isa 11:6.<br>
 <a name="fn60" href="2ki.htm#fnB60"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:24)  <i>Heb</i> "he cursed them in the name of the LORD." A curse was a formal appeal to a higher authority (here the Lord) to vindicate one's cause through judgment. As in chapter one, this account makes it clear that disrespect for the Lord's designated spokesmen can be deadly, for it is ultimately rejection of the Lord's authority.<br>
 <a name="fn61" href="2ki.htm#fnB61"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:25)  The two brief episodes recorded in vv. 19-25 demonstrate Elisha's authority and prove that he is the legitimate prophetic heir of Elijah.

 <a name="fn84" href="2ki.htm#fnB84"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:16)  <i>Heb</i> "making this valley cisterns, cisterns." The Hebrew noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bg</FONT> means "cistern" in Jer 14:3 (cf. Jer 39:10). The repetition of the noun is for emphasis. See GKC 396 &#167;123.<i>e</i>. The verb ("making") is an infinitive absolute, which has to be interpreted in light of the context. The translation above takes it in an imperatival sense. The command need not be understood as literal, but as hyperbolic. Telling them to build cisterns is a dramatic way of leading into the announcement that he would miraculously provide water in the desert. Some prefer to translate the infinitive as an imperfect with the Lord as the understood subject, "I will turn this valley [into] many pools." <br>

The infinitive absolute precedes the finite verb form for emphasis. (For another example of the Hophal infinitive with a Niphal finite verb, see Lev 19:20. Cf. also <i>IBHS</i>, 582.)

 <b>sn</b> (3:27)  The meaning of this statement is uncertain, for the subject of the anger is not indicated. Except for two relatively late texts, the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[xq</FONT> refers to an outburst of divine anger. But it seems unlikely the Lord would be angry with Israel, for he placed his stamp of approval on the campaign (vv. 16-19). Freedman suggests the narrator, who obviously has a bias against the Omride dynasty, included this observation to show that the Lord would not allow the Israelite king to "have an undiluted victory." (See footnote 8 in Cogan and Tadmor, <i>II Kings</i>, 52.) Some suggest that the original source identified Chemosh the Moabite god as the subject and that his name was later suppressed by a conscientious scribe, but this proposal raises more questions than it answers.

It is possible that a scribe has changed <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wl</FONT>, "to him," to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">al</FONT>, "not," because he felt that Elisha would not lie to the king. See Cogan and Tadmor, <i>II Kings</i>, 90. Another possibility is that a scribe has decided to harmonize Elisha's message with Hazael's words in v. 14.

It would then be quite natural to understand the last statement in the verse to refer to an Edomite retreat. Yet v. 22 goes on to state that the Edomite revolt was successful. Therefore, if the MT is retained, it may be better to understand the final statement in v. 21 as a reference to an Israelite retreat (made in spite of the success described in the preceding sentence). The translation above assumes an emendation of the Hebrew text. Adding a third masculine singular pronominal suffix to the accusative sign before Edom (reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wta</FONT>, "him," instead of just <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta</FONT>) and taking Edom as the subject of verbs allows one to translate the verse in a way that is more consistent with the context, which depicts an Israelite defeat, not victory. There is, however, no evidence for this emendation.<br>

On the one hand, she beautifies herself as if to seduce Jehu, but on the other hand, she insults and indirectly threatens him with this comparison to Zimri. Upon further reflection, however, her actions reveal a clear underlying motive. She wants to retain her power, not to mention her life. By beautifying herself, she appeals to Jehu's sexual impulses; by threatening him, she reminds him that he is in the same precarious position as Zimri. But, if he makes Jezebel his queen, he can consolidate his power. In other words through her actions and words Jezebel is saying to Jehu, "You desire me, don't you? And you need me!" <br>

The parallel passage in 2 Chr 22:11 has "and she put" at the beginning of the clause. Cogan and Tadmor (<i>II Kings</i>, 126) regard the Chronicles passage as an editorial attempt to clarify the difficulty of the original text. They prefer to take "him and his nurse" as objects of the verb "stole" and understand "in the bedroom" as the place where the royal descendants were executed. The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">twfmh rdjb</FONT>, "an inner room of beds," is sometimes understood as referring to a "bedroom" (see <i>HALOT</i> 293), though some prefer to see here a "room where the covers and cloths were kept" for the beds (see <i>HALOT</i> 573).

 <a name="fn492" href="2ki.htm#fnB492"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:7)  Verses 5b-7 read literally, "the third of you, the ones entering [on] the Sabbath and the ones guarding the guard of the house of the king, and the third in the gate of Sur, and the third in the gate behind the runners, and you will guard the guard of the house, alternating. And the two units of you, all the ones going out [on] the Sabbath, and they will guard the guard of the house of the LORD for the king." The precise meaning of this text is impossible to determine. It would appear that the Carians and royal bodyguard were divided into three units. One unit would serve during the Sabbath; the other two would be off duty on the Sabbath.

Most prefer to follow Lucian's Greek version and read "in Ibleam" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ulbyb</FONT>).<br>

 <b>tn</b> (17:15)  This idiom probably does not mean much if translated literally. It is found most often in Deuteronomy or in literature related to the covenant. It refers in the first instance to loyalty to God and to His covenant or His commandments (1 Kgs 14:8; 2 Chr 34:31) with the metaphor of a path or way underlying it (Deut 11:28; 28:14). To "follow other gods" was to abandon this way and this loyalty (to "abandon" or "forget" God, Judg 2:12; Hos 2:13) and to follow the customs or religious traditions of the pagan nations (2 Kgs 17:15). The classic text on "following" God or another god is 1 Kgs 18:18, 21 where Elijah taunts the people with "halting between two opinions" whether the LORD was the true God or Baal was. The idiom is often found followed by "to serve and to worship" or "they served and worshiped" such and such a god or entity (Jer 8:2; 11:10; 13:10; 16:11; 25:6; 35:15).<br>
 <a name="fn754" href="2ki.htm#fnB754"><sup>22</sup></a> <b>tn</b> (17:15)  <i>Heb</i> "they followed after the worthless thing/things and became worthless." The words "to me" are not in the Hebrew text but are implicit from the context. There is an obvious word play on the verb "became worthless" and the noun "worthless thing", which is probably to be understood collectively and to refer to idols as it does in Jer 8:19; 10:8; 14:22; Jonah 2:8.<br>

The extra material attested in the LXX was probably accidentally omitted in the Hebrew tradition when a scribe's eye jumped from the first occurrence of the phrase "man of God" (which appears right before the extra material) and the second occurrence of the phrase (which appears at the end of the extra material).<br>

If the phrase "the bones of the prophet" were appositional to "his bones," one would expect the sentence to end "from Judah" (see v. 17). Apparently the "prophet" referred to in the second half of the verse is the old prophet from Bethel who buried the man of God from Judah in his own tomb and instructed his sons to bury his bones there as well (1 Kgs 13:30-31). One expects the text to read "from Bethel," but "Samaria" (which was not even built at the time of the incident recorded in 1 Kgs 13) is probably an anachronistic reference to the northern kingdom in general.

 <a name="fn1115" href="2ki.htm#fnB1115"><sup>36</sup></a><b>sn</b> (25:25)  It is not altogether clear whether this is in the same year that Jerusalem fell or not. The wall was breached in the fourth month (= early July; Jer 39:2) and Nebuzaradan came and burned the palace, the temple, and many of the houses and tore down the wall in the fifth month (= early August; Jer 52:12). That would have left time between the fifth month and the seventh month (October) to gather in the harvest of grapes, dates and figs, and olives (Jer 40:12). However, many commentators feel that too much activity takes place in too short a time for this to have been in the same year and posit that it happened the following year or even five years later when a further deportation took place, possibly in retaliation for the murder of Gedaliah and the Babylonian garrison at Mizpah (Jer 52:30). The assassination of Gedaliah had momentous consequences and was commemorated in one of the post exilic fast days lamenting the fall of Jerusalem (Zech 8:19).<br>
