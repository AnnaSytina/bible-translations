Be sure the cache in your browser is turned on. When you open a large book
like Genesis or Luke, it will take a while to download the complete text to your
computer. Likewise, when you click on your first footnote, it will take
even longer to download the notes to the Notes Window (there are typically twice as much text in the notes file as in the main document). If you don't have
your cache turned on, it will take a long time everytime you click on a
footnote because it re-downloads the whole note file. Usually the cache
is turned on, so you probably don't have to worry about it, but if each
click on a footnote takes forever, that is the problem.
