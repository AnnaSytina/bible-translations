<a name="_Toc494012193"></a><p><i>A Prayer of Nehemiah</i>
<p><A NAME="1"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b><a name="fnB0" href="neh_note.htm#fn0"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> These are words of Nehemiah<a name="fnB1" href="neh_note.htm#fn1"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> son of Hacaliah:<p>
It so happened that in the month of Kislev, in the twentieth year, I was in Susa<a name="fnB2" href="neh_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> the citadel. 
<bqverse 2>2  Hanani, who was one of my relatives<a name="fnB3" href="neh_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a>, along with some of the men from Judah, came to me,<a name="fnB4" href="neh_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and I asked them about the fugitive Jews who remained from the exile and about Jerusalem.<p>

<bqverse 3>3  They said to me, "The remnant that remains from the exile there in the province are experiencing considerable<a name="fnB5" href="neh_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> adversity and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem lies breached, and its gates have been burned."<a name="fnB6" href="neh_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 4>4  When I heard these things I slumped<a name="fnB7" href="neh_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> down, crying and mourning for several days. I continued fasting and praying before the God of heaven. 
<bqverse 5>5  Then I said, "Please, O LORD God of heaven, great and awesome God, who keeps his loving covenant<a name="fnB8" href="neh_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> with those who love him and obey<a name="fnB9" href="neh_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> his commandments, 
<bqverse 6>6  may your ear be attentive and your eyes be open to hear the prayer of your servant that I am praying to you today throughout both day and night on behalf of your servants the Israelites. I am confessing the sins of the Israelites that we have committed<a name="fnB10" href="neh_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> against you--both I myself and my family<a name="fnB11" href="neh_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> have sinned. 
<bqverse 7>7  We have behaved corruptly against you, not obeying the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments that you commanded your servant Moses. 
<bqverse 8>8  Please recall the word you commanded your servant Moses: `If you act unfaithfully, I will scatter you among the nations.<a name="fnB12" href="neh_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  But if you repent<a name="fnB13" href="neh_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> and obey<a name="fnB14" href="neh_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> my commandments and do them, then even if your dispersed people are in the most remote location,<a name="fnB15" href="neh_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen for my name to reside'. 
<bqverse 10>10  They are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your mighty strength and by your powerful hand. 
<bqverse 11>11 Please,<a name="fnB16" href="neh_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> O Lord, listen attentively<a name="fnB17" href="neh_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer of your servants who take pleasure in showing respect<a name="fnB18" href="neh_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> to your name. Grant your servant success today and show compassion to me<a name="fnB19" href="neh_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> in the presence of this man." <p>
Now<a name="fnB20" href="neh_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> I was a cup-bearer for the king.
<bqchapter 2>
<a name="_Toc494012194"></a></p>
<p><i>Nehemiah Is Permitted to Go to Jerusalem</i>
<p><A NAME="2"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Then in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was brought to me,<a name="fnB21" href="neh_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> I took the wine and gave it to the king. Previously<a name="fnB22" href="neh_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> I had not been depressed in the king's presence.<a name="fnB23" href="neh_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  So the king said to me, "Why do you appear to be depressed when you aren't sick? What can this be other than sadness of heart?" This made me very fearful. <p>

<bqverse 3>3 I replied to the king, "O king, live forever! Why would I not be dejected in appearance when the city with the graves of my ancestors<a name="fnB24" href="neh_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> lies desolate and its gates destroyed<a name="fnB25" href="neh_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> by fire?" 
<bqverse 4>4 The king responded,<a name="fnB26" href="neh_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> "What is it you are seeking?" Then I quickly prayed to the God of heaven 
<bqverse 5>5  and said to the king, "If the king is so inclined and if your servant has found favor in your sight, dispatch me to Judah, to the city with the graves of my ancestors, so that I can rebuild it." 
<bqverse 6>6 Then the king, with his consort sitting beside him, replied, "How long would your trip take, and when would you return?" Since the king was amenable to dispatching me, I gave him a time. 
<bqverse 7>7 I said to the king, "If the king is so inclined, let him give me letters for the governors of the Trans-Euphrates<a name="fnB27" href="neh_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> that will enable me to travel safely until I reach Judah, 
<bqverse 8>8 and a letter for Asaph the keeper of the king's nature preserve, so that he will give me timber for beams for the gates of the fortress adjacent to the temple and for the wall<a name="fnB28" href="neh_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> of the city and for the home to which I go." So the king granted me these provisions,<a name="fnB29" href="neh_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> for the good hand of my God was on me. 
<bqverse 9>9 Then I went to the governors of the Trans-Euphrates, and I presented to them the letters from the king. The king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen. 
<bqverse 10>10 When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant heard all this, they were very displeased that someone had come to seek benefit for the Israelites.<a name="_Toc494012195"></a></p>
<p><i>Nehemiah Arrives in Jerusalem</i>
<p>
<bqverse 11>11 So I came to Jerusalem. When I had been there for three days, 
<bqverse 12>12 I got up during the night, along with a few men who were with me. But I did not tell anyone what my God was putting on my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no animals with me, except for the one<a name="fnB30" href="neh_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> I was riding. 
<bqverse 13>13 I proceeded through the Valley Gate by night, in the direction of the Well of the Dragons<a name="fnB31" href="neh_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> and the Dung Gate, and I was inspecting<a name="fnB32" href="neh_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> the walls of Jerusalem that had been breached and its gates that had been destroyed by fire. 
<bqverse 14>14 I passed on to the Gate of the Well and the King's Pool, where there was insufficient space for my animal to pass with me. 
<bqverse 15>15 I continued up the valley during the night, inspecting the wall. Then I turned and came to the Valley Gate, and so returned. 
<bqverse 16>16 The officials did not know where I had gone or what I had been doing, for up to this point I had not told any of the Jews or the priests or the nobles or the officials or the rest of the workers. 
<bqverse 17>17 Then I said to them, "You see the problem that we have: Jerusalem is desolate and its walls are burned. Come on! Let's rebuild the wall of Jerusalem so that this reproach will not continue." 
<bqverse 18>18 Then I related to them how the good hand of my God was on me and what<a name="fnB33" href="neh_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> the king had said to me. Then they replied, "Get going!<a name="fnB34" href="neh_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> Let's rebuild!" So they readied themselves<a name="fnB35" href="neh_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> for this good project. 
<bqverse 19>19 But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite servant, and Geshem the Arab heard all this,<a name="fnB36" href="neh_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> they derided us and expressed contempt toward us. They said, "What is this you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?" 
<bqverse 20>20 I responded to them by saying, "The God of heaven will prosper us. We his servants will start the rebuilding.<a name="fnB37" href="neh_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> But you have no just or ancient right in Jerusalem."<a name="fnB38" href="neh_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqchapter 3>
<a name="_Toc494012196"></a></p>
<p><i>The Names of the Builders</i>
<p><A NAME="3"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Then Eliashib the high priest and his priestly colleagues<a name="fnB39" href="neh_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> arose and built the Sheep Gate.

<bqchapter 4>

<p><i>Opposition to the Work Continues</i>
<p><A NAME="4"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b><i>(3.33)</i><a name="fnB62" href="neh_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> Now when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall he became angry and was quite upset. He derided the Jews, 
<bqverse 2>2  and in the presence of his colleagues<a name="fnB63" href="neh_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> and the army of Samaria he said, "What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they be left alone?<a name="fnB64" href="neh_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> Will they again offer sacrifice? Will they finish this in a day? Can they bring these burnt stones to life again from piles of dust?"<p>

<bqverse 3>3  Then Tobiah the Ammonite, who was close by, said, "If even a fox were to climb up on what they are building, it would break down their wall of stones!"<p>

<bqverse 4>4  Hear, O our God, for we are despised! Return their reproach on their own head! Reduce them to plunder in a land of exile! 
<bqverse 5>5  Do not cover their iniquity, and do not wipe out their sin from before them. For they have bitterly offended<a name="fnB65" href="neh_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> the builders.<a name="fnB66" href="neh_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 6>6  So we rebuilt the wall, and all the wall was joined together up to half its height.<a name="fnB67" href="neh_note.htm#fn67"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> The people were enthusiastic in their work.<a name="fnB68" href="neh_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 7>7 <i>(4.1)</i><a name="fnB69" href="neh_note.htm#fn69"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> When Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the people of Ashdod heard that the restoration of the walls of Jerusalem had moved ahead and that the breaches had begun to be closed, they were very angry. 
<bqverse 8>8  All of them conspired together to move with armed forces<a name="fnB70" href="neh_note.htm#fn70"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> against Jerusalem and to create disturbance in it. 
<bqverse 9>9  So we prayed to our God and stationed a guard to protect against them<a name="fnB71" href="neh_note.htm#fn71"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> both day and night. 
<bqverse 10>10  Then those in Judah said, "The strength of the laborers<a name="fnB72" href="neh_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> has failed! The debris is so great that we are unable to rebuild the wall." <p>

<bqverse 11>11  Our adversaries also boasted,<a name="fnB73" href="neh_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> "Before they are aware or anticipate<a name="fnB74" href="neh_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> anything, we will come in among them and kill them, and we will bring this work to a halt!"<p>

<bqverse 12>12  So it happened that the Jews who were living near them came and warned us repeatedly<a name="fnB75" href="neh_note.htm#fn75"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> about all the schemes<a name="fnB76" href="neh_note.htm#fn76"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> they were plotting<a name="fnB77" href="neh_note.htm#fn77"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> against us. <p>

<bqverse 13>13 So I stationed people at the lower places behind the wall in the exposed places.<a name="fnB78" href="neh_note.htm#fn78"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> I stationed the people by families, with their swords, spears, and bows. 
<bqverse 14>14  When I had made an inspection, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, "Don't be afraid of them. Remember the great and awesome Lord,<a name="fnB79" href="neh_note.htm#fn79"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and fight in behalf of your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your families!"<p>

<bqverse 15>15  It so happened that when our adversaries heard that we were aware of these matters,<a name="fnB80" href="neh_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> God frustrated their intentions. Then all of us returned to the wall, each to his own work. 
<bqverse 16>16 From that day forward, half of my men were doing the work and half of them were taking up spears,<a name="fnB81" href="neh_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> shields, bows, and body-armor. Now the officers were behind all the people<a name="fnB82" href="neh_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> of Judah 
<bqverse 17>17  who were rebuilding the wall.<a name="fnB83" href="neh_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> Those who were carrying loads did so<a name="fnB84" href="neh_note.htm#fn84"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> by keeping one hand on the work and the other on their weapon. 
<bqverse 18>18  The builders to a man had their swords strapped to their sides while they were building. But the trumpeter<a name="fnB85" href="neh_note.htm#fn85"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> remained with me.<p>

<bqverse 19>19  I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, "The work is demanding and extensive, and we are spread out on the wall, far removed from one another. 
<bqverse 20>20  Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, gather there with us. Our God will fight for us!" <p>

<bqverse 21>21  So we worked on,<a name="fnB86" href="neh_note.htm#fn86"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> with half<a name="fnB87" href="neh_note.htm#fn87"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> holding spears, from dawn till dusk.<a name="fnB88" href="neh_note.htm#fn88"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  At that time I instructed<a name="fnB89" href="neh_note.htm#fn89"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> the people, "Let every man and his coworker spend the night in Jerusalem and let them be guards for us by night and workers by day. 
<bqverse 23>23 We did not change clothes<a name="fnB90" href="neh_note.htm#fn90"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a>--not I, nor my relatives, nor my workers, nor the watchmen who were with me.

<a name="_Toc494012198"></a></p>
<p><i>Nehemiah Intervenes in behalf of the Oppressed</i>
<p><A NAME="5"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Then there was a great outcry from the people and their wives against their Jewish countrymen.<a name="fnB92" href="neh_note.htm#fn92"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  There were those who said, "With our sons and daughters, we are many. We must obtain<a name="fnB93" href="neh_note.htm#fn93"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> grain in order to eat and continue living." 
<bqverse 3>3 There were others who said, "We are putting up our fields, our vineyards, and our houses as collateral in order to obtain grain during the famine." 
<bqverse 4>4  Then there were those who said, "We have borrowed money to pay our taxes<a name="fnB94" href="neh_note.htm#fn94"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> on our fields and our vineyards. 
<bqverse 5>5  And now, though we are of the same flesh and blood as our fellow countrymen,<a name="fnB95" href="neh_note.htm#fn95"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> and our children are just like their children,<a name="fnB96" href="neh_note.htm#fn96"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> still we have found it necessary to subject our sons and daughters to slavery.<a name="fnB97" href="neh_note.htm#fn97"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> Some of our daughters have been subjected to slavery, while we are without power to help,<a name="fnB98" href="neh_note.htm#fn98"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> since our fields and vineyards now belong to other people."<a name="fnB99" href="neh_note.htm#fn99"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 6>6 I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these complaints. 
<bqverse 7>7  I considered these things carefully<a name="fnB100" href="neh_note.htm#fn100"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> and then registered a complaint with the wealthy<a name="fnB101" href="neh_note.htm#fn101"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and the officials. I said to them, "Each one of you is seizing the collateral<a name="fnB102" href="neh_note.htm#fn102"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> from your own countrymen."<a name="fnB103" href="neh_note.htm#fn103"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> Because of them I called for<a name="fnB104" href="neh_note.htm#fn104"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> a great assembly. 
<bqverse 8>8 I said to them, "We have bought back our fellow Jews<a name="fnB105" href="neh_note.htm#fn105"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> who had been sold to the Gentiles. But now you yourselves want to sell your own countrymen,<a name="fnB106" href="neh_note.htm#fn106"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> so that we can then buy them back!" They were utterly silent, and could find nothing to say. <p>

<bqverse 9>9  Then I<a name="fnB107" href="neh_note.htm#fn107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> said, "The thing that you are doing is wrong!<a name="fnB108" href="neh_note.htm#fn108"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> Should you not conduct yourselves<a name="fnB109" href="neh_note.htm#fn109"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> in the fear of our God, so as to not come under the reproach of the Gentiles who are our enemies? 
<bqverse 10>10 Even I and my relatives<a name="fnB110" href="neh_note.htm#fn110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> and my associates<a name="fnB111" href="neh_note.htm#fn111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> are lending them money and grain. But let us abandon this practice of seizing collateral!<a name="fnB112" href="neh_note.htm#fn112"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11 This very day return to them their fields, their vineyards, their olive trees, and their houses, along with the interest<a name="fnB113" href="neh_note.htm#fn113"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> on the money, the grain, the new wine, and the olive oil that you are exacting from them." <p>

<bqverse 12>12  They replied, "We will return these things,<a name="fnB114" href="neh_note.htm#fn114"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> and we will no longer demand anything from them. We will do just as you say." Then I called the priests and made them swear to do what had been agreed on.<a name="fnB115" href="neh_note.htm#fn115"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13 I also shook out my garment,<a name="fnB116" href="neh_note.htm#fn116"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> and I said, "In this way may God shake out from his house and his property every person who does not carry out<a name="fnB117" href="neh_note.htm#fn117"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> this matter. In this way may he be shaken out and emptied!" All the assembly replied, "So be it!," and they praised the LORD. Then the people did as they had agreed.<a name="fnB118" href="neh_note.htm#fn118"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 14>14 From the day that I was appointed<a name="fnB119" href="neh_note.htm#fn119"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> governor<a name="fnB120" href="neh_note.htm#fn120"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> in the land of Judah, that is, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes--twelve years in all--neither I nor my relatives<a name="fnB121" href="neh_note.htm#fn121"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> ate the food allotted to the governor.<a name="fnB122" href="neh_note.htm#fn122"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15 But the former governors who preceded me had burdened the people and had taken food and wine from them, in addition to<a name="fnB123" href="neh_note.htm#fn123"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> forty shekels of silver. Their associates were domineering over the people. But I did not behave in this way, due to my fear of God. 
<bqverse 16>16 I gave myself to this work on the wall, without even purchasing<a name="fnB124" href="neh_note.htm#fn124"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> a field. All my associates were gathered there for the work.<p>

<bqverse 17>17 There were one hundred fifty<b> </b>Jews and officials who dined with me,<a name="fnB125" href="neh_note.htm#fn125"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> in addition to those who came to us from the Gentiles. 
<bqverse 18>18  Every day one ox, six select sheep, and some birds were prepared for me, and every ten days all kinds of wine in abundance. With this I did not require the food allotted to the governor, for the work was demanding on this people.<p>

<bqverse 19>19  Please remember me for good, O my God, for all that I have done for this people.
<bqchapter 6>
<a name="_Toc494012199"></a></p>
<p><i>Opposition to the Rebuilding Efforts Continues</i>
<p><A NAME="6"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and no breach remained in it (even though up to that time I had not positioned doors in the gates), 
<bqverse 2>2  Sanballat and Geshem sent word to me saying, "Come on! Let's set up a time to meet together at Kephirim<a name="fnB126" href="neh_note.htm#fn126"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> in the plain of Ono." Now they intended to do me harm.<p>

<bqverse 3>3  So I sent messengers to them saying, "I am engaged in<a name="fnB127" href="neh_note.htm#fn127"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> an important work, and I am unable to come down. Why should the work come to a halt when I leave it to come down to you?" 
<bqverse 4>4  They contacted<a name="fnB128" href="neh_note.htm#fn128"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> me four times in this way; I responded the same way each time.<a name="fnB129" href="neh_note.htm#fn129"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 5>5  The fifth time that Sanballat sent his assistant to me in this way, he had an open letter in his hand. 
<bqverse 6>6  Written in it were the following words: <p>
"Among the nations it is rumored<a name="fnB130" href="neh_note.htm#fn130"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> (and Geshem<a name="fnB131" href="neh_note.htm#fn131"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> has substantiated<a name="fnB132" href="neh_note.htm#fn132"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> this) that you and the Jews have intentions of revolting, and for this reason you are building the wall. Furthermore, according to these rumors you are going to become their king. 
<bqverse 7>7  You have also established prophets to announce<a name="fnB133" href="neh_note.htm#fn133"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> in Jerusalem on your behalf, `We have a king in Judah!' Now the king is going to hear about these rumors. So come on! Let's talk about this."<a name="fnB134" href="neh_note.htm#fn134"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 8>8 I sent word back to him, "We are not engaged in these activities you are describing.<a name="fnB135" href="neh_note.htm#fn135"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> All of this is a figment of your imagination."<a name="fnB136" href="neh_note.htm#fn136"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 9>9  They all were wanting<a name="fnB137" href="neh_note.htm#fn137"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> to scare us, supposing, "Their hands will grow slack from the work, and it won't get done." <p>
So now, strengthen my hands!<a name="fnB138" href="neh_note.htm#fn138"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 10>10  Then I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel. He was confined to his home.<a name="fnB139" href="neh_note.htm#fn139"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> He said, "Let's set up a time to meet in the house of God, within the temple. Let's close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you. It will surely be at night that they will come to kill you." <p>

<bqverse 11>11  But I replied, "Should a man like me run away? Would someone like me flee to the temple in order to save his life?<a name="fnB140" href="neh_note.htm#fn140"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> I will not go!" 
<bqverse 12>12  I recognized the fact that God had not sent him, for he had spoken the prophecy against me as a hired agent of Tobiah and Sanballat.<a name="fnB141" href="neh_note.htm#fn141"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13 He had been hired to scare me so that I would do this and thereby sin. They would thus bring reproach on me and I<a name="fnB142" href="neh_note.htm#fn142"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> would be discredited.<a name="fnB143" href="neh_note.htm#fn143"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 14>14  Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat in light of these actions of theirs--also Noadiah the prophetess and the other prophets who were trying to scare me!<a name="_Toc494012200"></a></p>
<p><i>The Rebuilding of the Wall Is Finally Completed</i>
<p>
<bqverse 15>15  So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in just fifty-two days. 
<bqverse 16>16  When all our enemies heard and all the nations who were around us saw<a name="fnB144" href="neh_note.htm#fn144"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> this, they were greatly disheartened.<a name="fnB145" href="neh_note.htm#fn145"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> They knew that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God.<p>

<bqverse 17>17  In those days the nobles of Judah repeatedly sent letters to Tobiah, and responses from Tobiah were repeatedly coming to them. 
<bqverse 18>18  For many in Judah had sworn allegiance to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah. His son Jonathan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah.
<bqverse 19>19  They were telling me about his good deeds and then taking back to him the things I said.<a name="fnB146" href="neh_note.htm#fn146"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> Tobiah, on the other hand, sent letters in order to scare me.<p>

<bqchapter 7><A NAME="7"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> When the wall had been rebuilt and I had positioned the doors, and the gate-keepers, the singers, and the Levites had been appointed, 
<bqverse 2>2  I then appointed over Jerusalem my brother Hanani and Hananiah<a name="fnB147" href="neh_note.htm#fn147"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> the chief of the citadel, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many do. 
<bqverse 3>3  I<a name="fnB148" href="neh_note.htm#fn148"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> said to them, "The gates of Jerusalem must not be opened in the early morning,<a name="fnB149" href="neh_note.htm#fn149"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> until those who are standing guard close the doors and lock them.<a name="fnB150" href="neh_note.htm#fn150"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> Position residents of Jerusalem as guards, some at their guard stations and some near their homes." 
<bqverse 4>4  Now the city was spread out<a name="fnB151" href="neh_note.htm#fn151"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and large, and there were not a lot of people in it. At that time houses had not been rebuilt. 
<bqverse 5>5  My God placed it on my heart to gather the nobles, the officials, and the people so they could be enrolled on the basis of genealogy. I found the genealogical records<a name="fnB152" href="neh_note.htm#fn152"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> of those who had formerly returned. Here is what I found written in that record:<a name="fnB153" href="neh_note.htm#fn153"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 6>6 These are the people<a name="fnB154" href="neh_note.htm#fn154"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> of the province who were going up from the captivity of the exiles, whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had forced into exile to Babylon. They returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, each to his own city.

<bqverse 65>65 The governor<a name="fnB166" href="neh_note.htm#fn166"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> instructed them not to eat any of the sacred food until there was a priest who could consult<a name="fnB167" href="neh_note.htm#fn167"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> the Urim and Thummim.<p>

<bqverse 66>66  The entire group numbered 42,360, 
<bqverse 67>67  not counting their 7,337 male and female servants. They also had 245 male and female singers. 
<bqverse 68>68  They had 736 horses, 245 mules,

<bqverse 70>70  Some of the family leaders<a name="fnB169" href="neh_note.htm#fn169"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> contributed to the work.

<bqverse 71>71  Some of the family leaders gave to the project treasury 20,000 gold drachmas and 2,200 minas of silver. 
<bqverse 72>72 What the rest of the people gave amounted to 20,000 gold drachmas, 2,000 minas of silver, and 67 priestly garments. <p>

<p><i>The People Respond to the Reading of the Law</i>
<p>When the seventh month arrived and the Israelites<a name="fnB171" href="neh_note.htm#fn171"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> were settled in their cities, <A NAME="8"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> all the people gathered together<a name="fnB172" href="neh_note.htm#fn172"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> in the plaza which was in front of the Water Gate. They asked<a name="fnB173" href="neh_note.htm#fn173"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the LORD had commanded Israel. 
<bqverse 2>2  So Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly which included men and women and all those able to understand what they heard. (This happened on the first day of the seventh month.) 
<bqverse 3>3  So he read it before the plaza in front of the Water Gate from dawn till noon<a name="fnB174" href="neh_note.htm#fn174"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> before the men and women and those who could understand. All the people were eager to hear<a name="fnB175" href="neh_note.htm#fn175"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> the book of the law.<p>

<bqverse 4>4 Ezra the scribe stood on a towering platform<a name="fnB176" href="neh_note.htm#fn176"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> constructed for this purpose. Standing near him on his right were Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Masseiah. On his left were Pedaiah, Mishael, Malkijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam. 
<bqverse 5>5  Ezra opened the book in plain view<a name="fnB177" href="neh_note.htm#fn177"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> of all the people, for he was elevated above all the people. When he opened the book, all the people stood up. 
<bqverse 6>6  Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God, and all the people replied "Amen! Amen!" as they lifted their hands. Then they bowed down and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground.<p>

<bqverse 7>7  Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah--all of whom were Levites<a name="fnB178" href="neh_note.htm#fn178"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a>--were teaching the people the law, as the people remained standing. 
<bqverse 8>8  They read from the book of God's law, explaining it and imparting insight. Thus the people<a name="fnB179" href="neh_note.htm#fn179"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> gained understanding from what was read.<p>

<bqverse 9>9  Then Nehemiah the governor,<a name="fnB180" href="neh_note.htm#fn180"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> Ezra the priestly scribe,<a name="fnB181" href="neh_note.htm#fn181"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> and the Levites who were imparting understanding to the people said to all of them,<a name="fnB182" href="neh_note.htm#fn182"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> "This day is holy to the LORD your God. Do not mourn or weep." For all the people had been weeping when they heard the words of the law. 
<bqverse 10>10  He said to them, "Go and eat delicacies and drink sweet drinks and send portions to those for whom nothing is prepared. For this day is holy to our Lord.<a name="fnB183" href="neh_note.htm#fn183"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> Do not grieve, for the joy of the LORD is your strength."<p>

<bqverse 11>11  Then the Levites quieted all the people saying, "Be quiet, for this day is holy. Do not grieve." 
<bqverse 12>12  So all the people departed to eat and drink and to share their food<a name="fnB184" href="neh_note.htm#fn184"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> with others<a name="fnB185" href="neh_note.htm#fn185"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> and to enjoy tremendous joy,<a name="fnB186" href="neh_note.htm#fn186"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> for they had gained insight in the matters that had been made known to them.<p>

<bqverse 13>13  On the second day of the month the family leaders<a name="fnB187" href="neh_note.htm#fn187"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> were gathered to Ezra the scribe, together with all the people, the priests, and the Levites, to consider the words of the law. 
<bqverse 14>14  They discovered written in the law that the LORD had commanded through Moses that the Israelites should live in huts during the festival of the seventh month, 
<bqverse 15>15  and that they should make a proclamation and disseminate this message in all their cities and in Jerusalem: "Go to the hill country and bring back olive leaves and leaves of wild olive trees and leaves of myrtle trees and leaves of date-palms and of leafy trees to construct huts, as it is written."<p>

<bqverse 16>16  So the people went out and brought these things back and constructed huts for themselves, each on his roof and in his courtyard and in the courtyards of God's temple<a name="fnB188" href="neh_note.htm#fn188"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and in the plaza of the Water Gate and the plaza of the Ephraim Gate. 
<bqverse 17>17  So all the assembly which had returned from the exile constructed huts and lived in them. The Israelites had not so done from the days of Joshua son of Nun until that day. Everyone experienced very great joy.<a name="fnB189" href="neh_note.htm#fn189"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  Ezra<a name="fnB190" href="neh_note.htm#fn190"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> read in the book of the law of God day by day, from the first day to the last.<a name="fnB191" href="neh_note.htm#fn191"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> They observed the festival for seven days, and on the eighth day they held an assembly<a name="fnB192" href="neh_note.htm#fn192"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> as was required.<a name="fnB193" href="neh_note.htm#fn193"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 3>3  For one-fourth of the day they stood in their place and read from the book of the law of the LORD their God, and for another fourth they were confessing and worshiping the LORD their God.

<bqverse 5>5  The Levites--Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah--said, "Stand up and bless the LORD your God!"<p>
"May you be blessed, O LORD our God, from age to age.<a name="fnB199" href="neh_note.htm#fn199"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> May your glorious name<a name="fnB200" href="neh_note.htm#fn200"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> be blessed; may it be lifted up above all blessing and praise.

<bqverse 10>10 You performed awesome signs<a name="fnB207" href="neh_note.htm#fn207"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> against Pharaoh, against his servants, and against all the people of his land, for you knew that the Egyptians<a name="fnB208" href="neh_note.htm#fn208"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> had behaved presumptuously against them.

<bqverse 12>12  You guided them with a pillar of cloud by day and with a pillar of fire by night to illumine for them the path they were to travel.<p>

<bqverse 13>13  "You came down on Mount Sinai and spoke with them from heaven. You provided them with just judgments, true laws, and good statutes and commandments.

<bqverse 15>15  You provided bread from heaven for them in their time of hunger, and you brought forth water from the rock for them in their time of thirst.

<bqverse 16>16  "But they--our ancestors<a name="fnB213" href="neh_note.htm#fn213"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a>--behaved presumptuously; they rebelled<a name="fnB214" href="neh_note.htm#fn214"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> and did not obey your commandments. 
<bqverse 17>17  They refused to obey and did not recall your miracles that you had performed among them.

<bqverse 18>18  even when they made a cast image of a calf for themselves and said, `This is your God who brought you up from Egypt', or when they committed atrocious blasphemies.<p>

<bqverse 19>19  "Due to your great compassion you did not abandon them in the desert. The pillar of cloud did not stop guiding them in the path by day,<a name="fnB217" href="neh_note.htm#fn217"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> nor did the pillar of fire stop illuminating for them by night the path on which they should travel. 
<bqverse 20>20  You imparted your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold your manna from their mouths; you provided water for their thirst. 
<bqverse 21>21  For forty years you sustained them. Even in the desert they did not go wanting. Their clothes did not wear out and their feet did not swell.<p>

<bqverse 22>22  "You gave them kingdoms and peoples, and you allocated them to every corner of the land.<a name="fnB218" href="neh_note.htm#fn218"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> They inherited the land of King Sihon of Heshbon<a name="fnB219" href="neh_note.htm#fn219"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> and the land of King Og of Bashan. 
<bqverse 23>23  You multiplied their descendants like the stars of the sky. You brought them to the land you had told their ancestors to enter in order to possess. 
<bqverse 24>24  Their<a name="fnB220" href="neh_note.htm#fn220"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> descendants entered and possessed the land. You subdued before them the Canaanites who were the inhabitants of the land. You delivered them into their hand, together with their kings and the peoples of the land, to deal with as they wished. 
<bqverse 25>25  They captured fortified cities and fertile land. They took possession of houses full of all sorts of good things--wells previously dug, vineyards, olive trees, and fruit trees in abundance. They ate until they were full<a name="fnB221" href="neh_note.htm#fn221"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> and grew fat. They enjoyed to the full your great goodness.<p>

<bqverse 26>26  "Nonetheless they grew disobedient and rebelled against you; they disregarded your law.<a name="fnB222" href="neh_note.htm#fn222"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> They killed your prophets who had solemnly admonished them in order to cause them to return to you.

<bqverse 27>27  Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, and they oppressed them. But in the time of their distress they called to you, and you heard from heaven. In your abundant compassion you provided them with deliverers to rescue them from<a name="fnB223" href="neh_note.htm#fn223"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> their adversaries.<p>

<bqverse 28>28  "Then, when they were at rest again, they went back to doing evil before you.

When they again cried out to you, in your compassion you heard from heaven and rescued them time and again. 
<bqverse 29>29  But you solemnly admonished them so as to return them to your law, but they behaved presumptuously and did not obey your commandments. They sinned against your judgments--those by which an individual, if he obeys them,<a name="fnB225" href="neh_note.htm#fn225"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> will live.

<bqverse 30>30  You prolonged your kindness<a name="fnB228" href="neh_note.htm#fn228"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> with them for many years, and you solemnly admonished them by your Spirit through your prophets. Still they paid no attention,<a name="fnB229" href="neh_note.htm#fn229"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> so you delivered them into the hands of the resident peoples.<a name="fnB230" href="neh_note.htm#fn230"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 31>31  However, due to your abundant mercy you did not do away with them altogether; you did not abandon them. For you are a merciful and compassionate God.<p>

<bqverse 32>32  "So now, our God--the great, powerful, and awesome God, who keeps covenant fidelity<a name="fnB231" href="neh_note.htm#fn231"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a>--do not regard as inconsequential<a name="fnB232" href="neh_note.htm#fn232"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> all the hardship that has befallen us--our kings, our leaders, our priests, our prophets, our ancestors, and all your people--from the days of the kings of Assyria until this very day.

<p><i>The Population of Jerusalem</i>
<p><A NAME="11"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> So the leaders of the people settled in Jerusalem, while the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of every ten to settle in Jerusalem, the holy city, while the other nine<a name="fnB260" href="neh_note.htm#fn260"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> remained in other cities. 
<bqverse 2>2  The people gave their blessing on all the men who volunteered to settle in Jerusalem. <p>

<bqverse 3>3  These are the heads of the province who settled in Jerusalem. (While Israel, the priests, the Levites, the temple attendants, and the sons of the servants of Solomon settled in the cities of Judah, each on his own property in their cities, 
<bqverse 4>4  some of the descendants of Judah and some of the descendants of Benjamin settled in Jerusalem.) <p>
Of the descendants of Judah: <p>
Athaiah son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, from the descendants of Perez; 
<bqverse 5>5 and Maaseiah son of Baruch, the son of Col-Hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, from the descendants of Shelah.<a name="fnB261" href="neh_note.htm#fn261"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  The sum total of the descendants of Perez who were settling in Jerusalem was 468 efficient men. <p>

<bqverse 7>7 These are the descendants of Benjamin: <p>
Sallu son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah, 
<bqverse 8>8 and his followers, Gabbai and Sallai--928. 
<bqverse 9>9 Joel son of Zicri was the officer in charge of them, and Judah son of Hassenuah was second-in-command of the city. <p>

<bqverse 10>10  From the priests: <p>
Jedaiah son of Joiarib, Jakin, 
<bqverse 11>11 Seraiah son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, supervisor in the temple of God, 
<bqverse 12>12  and their colleagues<a name="fnB262" href="neh_note.htm#fn262"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> who were carrying out work for the temple--822; and Adaiah son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malkijah, 
<bqverse 13>13  and his colleagues who were heads of families<a name="fnB263" href="neh_note.htm#fn263"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a>--242; and Amashsai son of Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer, 
<bqverse 14>14  and his colleagues<a name="fnB264" href="neh_note.htm#fn264"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> who were capable men--128. The officer over them was Zabdiel the son of Haggedolim. <p>

<bqverse 15>15  From the Levites: <p>
Shemaiah son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni; 
<bqverse 16>16  Shabbethai and Jozabad, leaders<a name="fnB265" href="neh_note.htm#fn265"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> of the Levites, were in charge of the external work for the temple of God; 
<bqverse 17>17  Mattaniah son of Mica, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, the praise<a name="fnB266" href="neh_note.htm#fn266"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> leader who led in thanksgiving and prayer; Bakbukiah, second among his colleagues; and Abda son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun. 
<bqverse 18>18  The sum total of the Levites in the holy city was 284.<p>

<bqverse 19>19  And the gatekeepers: <p>
Akkub, Talmon and their colleagues who were guarding the gates--172. <p>

<bqverse 20>20  And the rest of Israel, with the priests and the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, each on his own property. <p>

<bqverse 21>21 The temple attendants were living on Ophel, and Ziha and Gishpa were over them.<a name="fnB267" href="neh_note.htm#fn267"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 22>22  The overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica. He was one of the descendants of Asaph who were the singers responsible for the service of the temple of God. 
<bqverse 23>23  For they were under royal orders<a name="fnB268" href="neh_note.htm#fn268"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> which determined their activity day by day. <p>

<bqverse 24>24  Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, one of the descendants of Zerah son of Judah, was an advisor to the king<a name="fnB269" href="neh_note.htm#fn269"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> in every matter pertaining to the people.<p>

<bqverse 25>25  As for the settlements with their fields, some of the people of Judah settled in Kiriath Arba and its neighboring regions, in Dibon and its regions,<a name="fnB270" href="neh_note.htm#fn270"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> in Jekabzeel and its settlements, 
<bqverse 26>26  in Jeshua, in Moladah, in Beth Pelet, 
<bqverse 27>27 in Hazar Shual, in Beersheba and its regions, 
<bqverse 28>28  in Ziklag, in Meconah and its regions, 
<bqverse 29>29  in En Rimmon, in Zorah, in Jarmuth, 
<bqverse 30>30  Zanoah, Adullam and their settlements, in Lachish and its fields, and in Azekah and its regions. So they were encamped from Beersheba to the Valley of Hinnom. <p>

<bqverse 31>31 Some of the descendants of<a name="fnB271" href="neh_note.htm#fn271"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> Benjamin settled in Geba,<a name="fnB272" href="neh_note.htm#fn272"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> Micmash, Aija, Bethel and its regions, 
<bqverse 32>32  in Anathoth, Nob, and Ananiah, 
<bqverse 33>33  in Hazor, Ramah, and Gittaim, 
<bqverse 34>34  in Hadid, Zeboim, and Neballat, 
<bqverse 35>35  in Lod, Ono, and<a name="fnB273" href="neh_note.htm#fn273"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> the Valley of the Craftsmen.<a name="fnB274" href="neh_note.htm#fn274"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 36>36  Some of the Judean divisions of the Levites settled in Benjamin.

<p><i>The Priests and the Levites Who Returned to Jerusalem</i>
<p><A NAME="12"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> These are the priests and Levites who went up with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, 
<bqverse 2>2  Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,

<bqverse 6>6  Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah, 
<bqverse 7>7  Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the leaders<a name="fnB276" href="neh_note.htm#fn276"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> of the priests and their colleagues<a name="fnB277" href="neh_note.htm#fn277"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> in the days of Jeshua. <p>

<bqverse 8>8  And the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who together with his colleagues was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving. 
<bqverse 9>9  Bakbukiah and Unni,<a name="fnB278" href="neh_note.htm#fn278"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> their colleagues, stood opposite them in the services. <p>

<bqverse 10>10  Jeshua was the father of Joiakim, Joiakim was the father of Eliashib, Eliashib was the father of Joiada, 
<bqverse 11>11  Joiada was the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan was the father of Jaddua. <p>

<bqverse 12>12  In the days of Joiakim, these were the priests who were leaders of the families: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah; 
<bqverse 13>13  of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; 
<bqverse 14>14  of Malluch,<a name="fnB279" href="neh_note.htm#fn279"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> Jonathan; of Shecaniah,<a name="fnB280" href="neh_note.htm#fn280"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> Joseph;

<bqverse 21>21  of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel. <p>

<bqverse 22>22  In the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan and Jaddua were recorded as heads of families, as were the priests in the reign of Darius the Persian. 
<bqverse 23>23  The descendants of Levi were recorded in the Book of the Chronicles as heads of families up to the days of Johanan son of Eliashib. 
<bqverse 24>24  And the leaders of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua son of Kadmiel, and their colleagues, who stood opposite them to offer praise and thanks, one contingent corresponding to the other, as specified by<a name="fnB284" href="neh_note.htm#fn284"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> David the man of God.<p>

<bqverse 25>25  Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers who were guarding the storerooms at the gates. 
<bqverse 26>26  These all served in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priestly scribe.<a name="fnB285" href="neh_note.htm#fn285"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> <a name="_Toc494012206"></a></p>
<p><i>The Wall of Jerusalem is Dedicated</i>
<p>
<bqverse 27>27  At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they sought the Levites from all the places they lived to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication joyfully with songs of thanksgiving and songs accompanied by cymbals, harps, and lyres. 
<bqverse 28>28  The singers<a name="fnB286" href="neh_note.htm#fn286"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> were also assembled from the district around Jerusalem and from the settlements of the Netophathites 
<bqverse 29>29  and from Beth Gilgal and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built settlements for themselves around Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 30>30  When the priests and Levites had purified themselves, they purified the people, the gates, and the wall. <p>

<bqverse 31>31  I brought the leaders of Judah up on the wall, and I appointed two large thanksgiving choirs. One was to proceed<a name="fnB287" href="neh_note.htm#fn287"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> on the top of the wall southward, toward the Dung Gate. 
<bqverse 32>32  Going after them were Hoshaiah, half the leaders of Judah, 
<bqverse 33>33  Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 
<bqverse 34>34  Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, 
<bqverse 35>35  some of the priests<a name="fnB288" href="neh_note.htm#fn288"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> with trumpets, Zechariah son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph, 
<bqverse 36>36  and his colleagues--Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani--with musical instruments of David the man of God. Now Ezra the scribe led them.<a name="fnB289" href="neh_note.htm#fn289"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 37>37  They went over the Fountain Gate and continued directly up the steps of the City of David on the ascent to the wall. They passed the house of David and continued on to the Water Gate toward the east. <p>

<bqverse 38>38  The second choir was proceeding<a name="fnB290" href="neh_note.htm#fn290"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> in the opposite direction. I followed them, along with half the people, on top of the wall, past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall, 
<bqverse 39>39  over the Ephraim Gate, the Jeshanah Gate,<a name="fnB291" href="neh_note.htm#fn291"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, and the Tower of the Hundred, to the Sheep Gate. They stopped<a name="fnB292" href="neh_note.htm#fn292"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> at the Gate of the Guard. <p>

<bqverse 40>40  Then the two choirs that gave thanks took their stations<a name="fnB293" href="neh_note.htm#fn293"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> in the temple of God. I did also, along with half the officials with me, 
<bqverse 41>41  and the priests--Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with their trumpets-- 
<bqverse 42>42  and also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam, and Ezer. The choirs sang loudly<a name="fnB294" href="neh_note.htm#fn294"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> under the direction of Jezrahiah. 
<bqverse 43>43  And on that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced, for God had given them great joy. The women and children also rejoiced. The rejoicing in Jerusalem could be heard from far away. <p>

<bqverse 44>44  On that day men were appointed over the storerooms for the contributions, first fruits, and tithes, to gather into them from<a name="fnB295" href="neh_note.htm#fn295"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> the fields of the cities the portions prescribed by the law for the priests and the Levites, for Judah took delight in the priests and Levites who were ministering.<a name="fnB296" href="neh_note.htm#fn296"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 45>45  They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, along with the singers and gatekeepers, according to the commandment of David and<a name="fnB297" href="neh_note.htm#fn297"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> his son Solomon. 
<bqverse 46>46  For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there had been directors<a name="fnB298" href="neh_note.htm#fn298"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> for the singers and for the songs of praise and thanks to God. 
<bqverse 47>47  So in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah, all Israel was contributing the portions for the singers and gatekeepers, according to the daily need. They also set aside<a name="fnB299" href="neh_note.htm#fn299"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> the portion for the Levites, and the Levites set aside the portion for the descendants of Aaron. 
<bqchapter 13>
<a name="_Toc494012207"></a></p>
<p><i>Further Reforms by Nehemiah</i>
<p><A NAME="13"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>On that day the book of Moses was read in the hearing<a name="fnB300" href="neh_note.htm#fn300"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> of the people. They found<a name="fnB301" href="neh_note.htm#fn301"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite may ever enter the assembly of God, 
<bqverse 2>2  for they had not met the Israelites with food<a name="fnB302" href="neh_note.htm#fn302"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> and water, but instead had hired Balaam to curse them. (Our God, however, turned the curse into blessing.) 
<bqverse 3>3  When they heard the law, they removed from Israel all who were of mixed ancestry.<p>

<bqverse 4>4  But prior to this time, Eliashib the priest, a relative of Tobiah, had been appointed over the storerooms<a name="fnB303" href="neh_note.htm#fn303"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> of the temple of our God. 
<bqverse 5>5  He made for himself a large storeroom where previously they had been keeping<a name="fnB304" href="neh_note.htm#fn304"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> the grain offering, the incense, and the vessels, along with the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the olive oil as commanded for the Levites, the singers, the gate keepers, and the offering for the priests.<p>

<bqverse 6>6  During all this time I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes of Babylon, I had gone to the king. After some time I had requested leave of the king, 
<bqverse 7>7  and I returned to Jerusalem. Then I discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah by supplying him with a storeroom in the courts of the temple of God. 
<bqverse 8>8  I was very upset, and I threw all of Tobiah's household possessions out of the storeroom. 
<bqverse 9>9  Then I gave instructions that the storerooms should be purified, and I brought back the equipment of the temple of God, along with the grain offering and the incense.<p>

<bqverse 10>10  I also discovered that the grain offerings for the Levites had not been provided, and that as a result the Levites and the singers who performed this work had all gone off to their fields. 
<bqverse 11>11  So I registered a complaint with the leaders, asking "Why is the temple of God neglected?" Then I gathered them and reassigned them to their positions.<a name="fnB305" href="neh_note.htm#fn305"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 12>12 Then all of Judah brought the tithe of the grain, the new wine, and the olive oil to the storerooms. 
<bqverse 13>13  I gave instructions<a name="fnB306" href="neh_note.htm#fn306"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> that Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and a certain Levite named Pedaiah be put in charge of<a name="fnB307" href="neh_note.htm#fn307"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> the storerooms, and that Hanan son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah, be their assistant,<a name="fnB308" href="neh_note.htm#fn308"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> for they were regarded as trustworthy. It was then their responsibility to oversee the distribution to their colleagues.<a name="fnB309" href="neh_note.htm#fn309"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 14>14  Please remember me for this, O my God, and do not wipe out the kindness that I have done for the temple of my God and for its services! <p>

<bqverse 15>15  In those days I saw people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath, bringing in heaps of grain and loading them onto donkeys, along with wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of loads, and bringing them to Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I warned them on the day that they sold these provisions. 
<bqverse 16>16  The people from Tyre who lived there were bringing fish and all kinds of merchandise and were selling it on the Sabbath to the people of Judah--and in Jerusalem, of all places! 
<bqverse 17>17  So I registered a complaint with the nobles of Judah, saying to them "What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the Sabbath day? 
<bqverse 18>18  Isn't this the way your ancestors<a name="fnB310" href="neh_note.htm#fn310"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> acted, causing our God to bring on them and on this city all this misfortune? And now you are causing even more wrath on Israel, profaning the Sabbath like this!<p>

<bqverse 19>19  When the evening shadows<a name="fnB311" href="neh_note.htm#fn311"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> began to fall on the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I ordered<a name="fnB312" href="neh_note.htm#fn312"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> the doors to be closed. I further directed that they were not to be opened until after the Sabbath. I positioned<a name="fnB313" href="neh_note.htm#fn313"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> some of my young men at the gates so that no load could enter on the Sabbath day. 
<bqverse 20>20  The traders and sellers of all kinds of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem once or twice. 
<bqverse 21>21  But I warned them and said, "Why do you spend the night by the wall? If you repeat this, I will forcibly remove you!"<a name="fnB314" href="neh_note.htm#fn314"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath.<a name="fnB315" href="neh_note.htm#fn315"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  Then I directed the Levites to purify themselves and come and guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy.<p>
For this please remember me, O my God, and have pity on me in keeping with your great love. <p>

<bqverse 23>23  Also in those days I saw the men of Judah who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. 
<bqverse 24>24  Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod (or the language of one of the other peoples mentioned<a name="fnB316" href="neh_note.htm#fn316"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a>) and were unable to speak the language of Judah. 
<bqverse 25>25  So I entered a complaint with them. I expressed a curse on them, and I struck some of the men and pulled out their hair. I had them swear by God saying, "You will not marry off<a name="fnB317" href="neh_note.htm#fn317"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> your daughters to their sons, and you will not take any of their daughters as wives for your sons or for yourselves! 
<bqverse 26>26  Was it not because of things like these that King Solomon of Israel sinned? Among the many nations there was no king like him. He was loved by his God, and God made<a name="fnB318" href="neh_note.htm#fn318"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> him king over all Israel. But the foreign wives made even him sin! 
<bqverse 27>27 Then in your case, should we hear that you do all this great evil, thereby being unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign wives?"<p>

<bqverse 28>28  Now one of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high priest was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite. So I banished him from my sight.<p>

<bqverse 29>29  Please remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, the covenant of the priesthood,<a name="fnB319" href="neh_note.htm#fn319"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> and the Levites.<p>

<bqverse 30>30  So I purified them of everything foreign, and I assigned specific<a name="fnB320" href="neh_note.htm#fn320"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> duties to the priests and the Levites. 
<bqverse 31>31  I also provided for<a name="fnB321" href="neh_note.htm#fn321"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> the wood offering at the appointed times and also for the first fruits. <p>
Please remember me for good, O my God.</p>
