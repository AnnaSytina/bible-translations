<a name="_Toc494013734"></a><p><i>Salutation</i>
<p><A NAME="1"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> From Paul<a name="fnB0" href="2th_note.htm#fn0"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> and Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
<bqverse 2>2  Grace and peace to you<a name="fnB1" href="2th_note.htm#fn1"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> from God the<a name="fnB2" href="2th_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> Father and the Lord Jesus Christ! <a name="_Toc403221944"></a><a name="_Toc416894434"></a><a name="_Toc432265297"></a><a name="_Toc485060238"></a><a name="_Toc494013735"></a></p>
<p><i>Thanksgiving</i>
<p>
<bqverse 3>3  We ought to thank God always for you, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB3" href="2th_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> and rightly so,<a name="fnB4" href="2th_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> because your faith flourishes more and more and the love of each one of you all for one another is ever greater. 
<bqverse 4>4  As a result we ourselves boast about you in the churches of God for your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and afflictions you are enduring.<a name="_Toc403221945"></a><a name="_Toc416894435"></a><a name="_Toc432265298"></a><a name="_Toc485060239"></a><a name="_Toc494013736"></a></p>
<p><i>Encouragement in Persecution</i>
<p>
<bqverse 5>5  This is evidence of God's righteous judgment, to make you worthy<a name="fnB5" href="2th_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> of the kingdom of God, for which in fact you are suffering. 
<bqverse 6>6  For it is right<a name="fnB6" href="2th_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you, 
<bqverse 7>7  and to you who are being afflicted to give rest together with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed<a name="fnB7" href="2th_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> from heaven with his mighty angels.<a name="fnB8" href="2th_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  <i>With flaming fire he will mete out</i><a name="fnB9" href="2th_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> <i>punishment on those who do not know God</i><a name="fnB10" href="2th_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. 
<bqverse 9>9  They<a name="fnB11" href="2th_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> will undergo the penalty of eternal destruction, <i>away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might</i>,<a name="fnB12" href="2th_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  when he comes to be glorified among his saints and admired<a name="fnB13" href="2th_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> on that day among all who have believed--and you did in fact believe our testimony.<a name="fnB14" href="2th_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  And in this regard we pray for you always, that our God will make you worthy of his calling<a name="fnB15" href="2th_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> and fulfill by his power your every desire for goodness and work of faith, 
<bqverse 12>12  that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to<a name="fnB16" href="2th_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<p><i>The Day of the Lord</i>
<p><A NAME="2"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Now regarding the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered so as to be with him,<a name="fnB17" href="2th_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> we ask you, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB18" href="2th_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  that you not be easily<a name="fnB19" href="2th_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> shaken from your composure or be disturbed by any kind of spirit or message or letter allegedly from us,<a name="fnB20" href="2th_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> to the effect that the day of the Lord is already here. 
<bqverse 3>3  Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not arrive until the rebellion comes<a name="fnB21" href="2th_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> and the man of lawlessness<a name="fnB22" href="2th_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> is revealed, the son of destruction.<a name="fnB23" href="2th_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  He<a name="fnB24" href="2th_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> opposes <i>and exalts himself above every</i> so-called <i>god</i> or object of worship, and as a result <i>he takes his seat</i><a name="fnB25" href="2th_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> in God's temple, displaying himself as God.<a name="fnB26" href="2th_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  Surely you recall<a name="fnB27" href="2th_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> that I used to tell you these things while I was still with you. 
<bqverse 6>6  And so<a name="fnB28" href="2th_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> you know what holds him back,<a name="fnB29" href="2th_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> so that he will be revealed in his own time. 
<bqverse 7>7  For the hidden power of lawlessness<a name="fnB30" href="2th_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> is already at work. However, the one who holds him back<a name="fnB31" href="2th_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> will do so until he is taken out of the way, 
<bqverse 8>8  and then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord<a name="fnB32" href="2th_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> will destroy by the breath of his mouth and wipe out by the manifestation of his coming. 
<bqverse 9>9  The coming of the lawless one<a name="fnB33" href="2th_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> will be by Satan's working with all kinds of miracles<a name="fnB34" href="2th_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and signs and false wonders, 
<bqverse 10>10  and with every kind of evil deception directed against<a name="fnB35" href="2th_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> those who are perishing, because they found no place in their hearts for the truth<a name="fnB36" href="2th_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> so as to be saved. 
<bqverse 11>11  Consequently<a name="fnB37" href="2th_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> God sends on them a deluding influence<a name="fnB38" href="2th_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> that they may believe what is false. 
<bqverse 12>12  And so they will all<a name="fnB39" href="2th_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> be judged<a name="fnB40" href="2th_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> who have not believed the truth but have delighted in evil.<a name="_Toc403221947"></a><a name="_Toc416894437"></a><a name="_Toc432265300"></a><a name="_Toc485060241"></a><a name="_Toc494013738"></a></p>
<p><i>Call to Stand Firm</i>
<p>
<bqverse 13>13  But we ought to give thanks for you always, brothers and sisters<a name="fnB41" href="2th_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> loved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning<a name="fnB42" href="2th_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth. 
<bqverse 14>14  He called you to this salvation<a name="fnB43" href="2th_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> through our gospel, so that you may possess the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name="fnB44" href="2th_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  Therefore, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB45" href="2th_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> stand firm and hold on to the traditions that we taught you, whether by speech or by letter.<a name="fnB46" href="2th_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by grace gave us eternal comfort and good hope, 
<bqverse 17>17  encourage your hearts and strengthen you<a name="fnB47" href="2th_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> in every good thing you do or say.<a name="fnB48" href="2th_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Request for Prayer</i>
<p><A NAME="3"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Finally, pray for us, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB49" href="2th_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> that the Lord's message<a name="fnB50" href="2th_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> may spread quickly and be honored<a name="fnB51" href="2th_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> as in fact it was among you, 
<bqverse 2>2  and that we may be delivered from perverse and evil people. For not all have faith. 
<bqverse 3>3  But the Lord is faithful and he<a name="fnB52" href="2th_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> will strengthen you and protect you from the evil one. 
<bqverse 4>4  And we are confident about you in the Lord that you are both doing--and will do--what we are commanding. 
<bqverse 5>5  Now may the Lord direct your hearts toward the love of God and the endurance of Christ.<a name="_Toc403221949"></a><a name="_Toc416894439"></a><a name="_Toc432265302"></a><a name="_Toc485060243"></a><a name="_Toc494013740"></a></p>
<p><i>Response to the Undisciplined</i>
<p>
<bqverse 6>6  But we command you, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB53" href="2th_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from any brother who lives an undisciplined<a name="fnB54" href="2th_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> life<a name="fnB55" href="2th_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> and not according to the tradition you received from us. 
<bqverse 7>7  For you know yourselves how you must imitate us, because we did not behave without discipline<a name="fnB56" href="2th_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> among you, 
<bqverse 8>8  and we did not eat anyone's food<a name="fnB57" href="2th_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> without paying.<a name="fnB58" href="2th_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> Instead, in toil and drudgery we worked<a name="fnB59" href="2th_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> night and day in order not to burden any of you. 
<bqverse 9>9  It was not because we do not have that right, but to give ourselves as an example for you to imitate.<a name="fnB60" href="2th_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  For even when we were with you we used to give you this command: "If anyone is not willing to work, neither should he eat." 
<bqverse 11>11  For we hear that some among you are living an undisciplined life,<a name="fnB61" href="2th_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> not doing their own work but meddling in the work of others.<a name="fnB62" href="2th_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  Now such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and so provide their own food to eat.<a name="fnB63" href="2th_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  But you, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB64" href="2th_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> do not grow weary in doing what is right. 
<bqverse 14>14  But if anyone does not obey our message through this letter, take note of him and do not associate closely with him, so that he may be ashamed. 
<bqverse 15>15  Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.<a name="fnB65" href="2th_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc403221950"></a><a name="_Toc416894440"></a><a name="_Toc432265303"></a><a name="_Toc485060244"></a><a name="_Toc494013741"></a></p>
<p><i>Closing</i>
<p>
<bqverse 16>16  Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with you all. 
<bqverse 17>17  I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, which is how I write in every letter.<a name="fnB66" href="2th_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.</p>
