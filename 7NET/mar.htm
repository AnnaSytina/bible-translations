<bqverse 5>5  People<a name="fnB9" href="mar_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> from the whole Judean countryside and all of Jerusalem were going out to him, and he was baptizing them<a name="fnB10" href="mar_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins.

<p><i>The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus</i>
<p>
<bqverse 9>9 Now<a name="fnB15" href="mar_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> in those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.<a name="fnB16" href="mar_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  And just as Jesus<a name="fnB17" href="mar_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens<a name="fnB18" href="mar_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> splitting apart and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.<a name="fnB19" href="mar_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 11>11  And a voice came from heaven: "You are my one dear Son;<a name="fnB20" href="mar_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> in you I take great delight."<a name="fnB21" href="mar_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12 The Spirit immediately drove him into the wilderness. 
<bqverse 13>13 He was in the wilderness forty days,<a name="fnB22" href="mar_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> enduring temptations from Satan. He<a name="fnB23" href="mar_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> was with wild animals, and angels were ministering to his needs.<a name="fnB24" href="mar_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc403221421"></a><a name="_Toc416893909"></a><a name="_Toc432264769"></a><a name="_Toc485059709"></a><a name="_Toc494013206"></a></p>
<p><i>The Beginning of Jesus' Ministry and the Call of the Disciples</i>
<p>
<bqverse 14>14 Now after John was imprisoned,<a name="fnB25" href="mar_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> Jesus went into Galilee and proclaimed the gospel of God. 
<bqverse 15>15  He<a name="fnB26" href="mar_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> said, "The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God<a name="fnB27" href="mar_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> is near. Repent and believe the gospel!" 
<bqverse 16>16 As he went along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, Simon's brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishermen).<a name="fnB28" href="mar_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 17>17  Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will turn you into fishers of people."<a name="fnB29" href="mar_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  They left their nets immediately and followed him.<a name="fnB30" href="mar_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 19>19  Going on a little farther, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother in their<a name="fnB31" href="mar_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> boat mending nets. 
<bqverse 20>20  Immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, and followed him.<a name="_Toc403221422"></a><a name="_Toc416893910"></a><a name="_Toc432264770"></a><a name="_Toc485059710"></a><a name="_Toc494013207"></a></p>
<p><i>Jesus</i>'<i> Authority</i>
<p>
<bqverse 21>21 Then<a name="fnB32" href="mar_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> they went to Capernaum.<a name="fnB33" href="mar_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> When the Sabbath came, Jesus<a name="fnB34" href="mar_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> went into the synagogue<a name="fnB35" href="mar_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> and began to teach. 
<bqverse 22>22  The people there<a name="fnB36" href="mar_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> were amazed by his teaching, because he taught them like one who had authority,<a name="fnB37" href="mar_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> not like the experts in the law.<a name="fnB38" href="mar_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 23>23 Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit,<a name="fnB39" href="mar_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> and he cried out,<a name="fnB40" href="mar_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  "Leave us alone,<a name="fnB41" href="mar_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> Jesus the Nazarene! Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One<a name="fnB42" href="mar_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> of God!" 
<bqverse 25>25  But<a name="fnB43" href="mar_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> Jesus rebuked him,<a name="fnB44" href="mar_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> "Silence! Come out of him!"<a name="fnB45" href="mar_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  After throwing him into convulsions, the unclean spirit cried out with a loud voice and came out of him. 
<bqverse 27>27  They were all amazed so that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands the unclean spirits and they obey him." 
<bqverse 28>28  So<a name="fnB46" href="mar_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> the news about him spread quickly throughout all the region around Galilee.<a name="_Toc403221423"></a><a name="_Toc416893911"></a><a name="_Toc432264771"></a><a name="_Toc485059711"></a><a name="_Toc494013208"></a></p>
<p><i>Healings at Simon</i>'<i>s House </i>
<p>
<bqverse 29>29  Now<a name="fnB47" href="mar_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> as soon as they left the synagogue,<a name="fnB48" href="mar_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> they entered Simon and Andrew's house, with James and John.
<bqverse 30>30  Simon's mother-in-law was lying down, sick with a fever, so<a name="fnB49" href="mar_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> they spoke to Jesus<a name="fnB50" href="mar_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> at once about her. 
<bqverse 31>31  He came and raised her up by gently taking her hand. Then the fever left her and she began to serve<a name="fnB51" href="mar_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> them. 
<bqverse 32>32 When it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all who were sick and demon-possessed. 
<bqverse 33>33  The whole town gathered by the door. 
<bqverse 34>34  So<a name="fnB52" href="mar_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> he healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons.<a name="fnB53" href="mar_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> But<a name="fnB54" href="mar_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> he would not permit the demons to speak,<a name="fnB55" href="mar_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> because they knew him.<a name="_Toc432264772"></a><a name="_Toc485059712"></a><a name="_Toc494013209"></a></p>
<p><i>Praying and Preaching </i>
<p>
<bqverse 35>35  Then<a name="fnB56" href="mar_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> Jesus<a name="fnB57" href="mar_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> got up early in the morning when it was still very dark, departed, and went out to a deserted place, and there he spent time in prayer.<a name="fnB58" href="mar_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 36>36  Simon and his companions searched for him. 
<bqverse 37>37  When they found him, they said, "Everyone is looking for you." 
<bqverse 38>38  He replied,<a name="fnB59" href="mar_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> "Let us go elsewhere, into the surrounding villages, so that I can preach there too. For that is what I came out to do." 
<bqverse 39>39 So<a name="fnB60" href="mar_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> he went into all of Galilee preaching in their synagogues<a name="fnB61" href="mar_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> and casting out demons.<a name="_Toc403221425"></a><a name="_Toc416893913"></a><a name="_Toc432264773"></a><a name="_Toc485059713"></a><a name="_Toc494013210"></a></p>
<p><i>Cleansing a Leper</i>
<p>
<bqverse 40>40 Now<a name="fnB62" href="mar_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> a leper<a name="fnB63" href="mar_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> came to him and fell to his knees, asking for help. "If<a name="fnB64" href="mar_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> you are willing, you can make me clean," he said. 
<bqverse 41>41  Moved with compassion,<a name="fnB65" href="mar_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a> Jesus<a name="fnB66" href="mar_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> stretched out his hand and touched<a name="fnB67" href="mar_note.htm#fn67"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a> him, saying, "I am willing. Be clean!" 
<bqverse 42>42  The leprosy left him at once, and he was clean. 
<bqverse 43>43  Immediately Jesus<a name="fnB68" href="mar_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>69</SUP></FONT></a> sent the man<a name="fnB69" href="mar_note.htm#fn69"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>70</SUP></FONT></a> away with a very strong warning. 
<bqverse 44>44  He told him,<a name="fnB70" href="mar_note.htm#fn70"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>71</SUP></FONT></a> "See that you do not say anything to anyone;<a name="fnB71" href="mar_note.htm#fn71"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>72</SUP></FONT></a> but go, show yourself to a priest, and bring the offering that Moses commanded<a name="fnB72" href="mar_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>73</SUP></FONT></a> for your cleansing as a testimony to them."<a name="fnB73" href="mar_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>74</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 45>45  But as the man<a name="fnB74" href="mar_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>75</SUP></FONT></a> went out he began to announce it publicly and spread the story widely, so that Jesus<a name="fnB75" href="mar_note.htm#fn75"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>76</SUP></FONT></a> was no longer able to enter any town openly but stayed outside in remote places. Still<a name="fnB76" href="mar_note.htm#fn76"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>77</SUP></FONT></a> they kept coming<a name="fnB77" href="mar_note.htm#fn77"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>78</SUP></FONT></a> to him from everywhere.

<p><i>Healing and Forgiving a Paralytic </i>
<p><A NAME="2"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Now<a name="fnB78" href="mar_note.htm#fn78"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> after some days, when he returned to Capernaum,<a name="fnB79" href="mar_note.htm#fn79"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> the news spread<a name="fnB80" href="mar_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> that he was at home. 
<bqverse 2>2  So many gathered that there was no longer any room, not even by the door, and he preached the word to them. 
<bqverse 3>3  Some people came bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them.<a name="fnB81" href="mar_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  When they were not able to bring him in because of the crowd, they removed the roof<a name="fnB82" href="mar_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> above Jesus.<a name="fnB83" href="mar_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> Then,<a name="fnB84" href="mar_note.htm#fn84"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> after tearing it out, they lowered the stretcher the paralytic was lying on. 
<bqverse 5>5  When Jesus saw their<a name="fnB85" href="mar_note.htm#fn85"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."<a name="fnB86" href="mar_note.htm#fn86"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  Now some of the experts in the law<a name="fnB87" href="mar_note.htm#fn87"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> were sitting there, turning these things over in their minds:<a name="fnB88" href="mar_note.htm#fn88"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  "Why does this man speak this way? He is blaspheming!<a name="fnB89" href="mar_note.htm#fn89"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> Who can forgive sins but God alone?" 
<bqverse 8>8  Now<a name="fnB90" href="mar_note.htm#fn90"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> immediately, when Jesus realized in his spirit that they were contemplating such thoughts,<a name="fnB91" href="mar_note.htm#fn91"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> he said to them, "Why are you thinking such things in your hearts?<a name="fnB92" href="mar_note.htm#fn92"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  Which is easier,<a name="fnB93" href="mar_note.htm#fn93"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> to say to the paralytic, `Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, `Stand up, take your stretcher, and walk'? 
<bqverse 10>10  But so that you may know<a name="fnB94" href="mar_note.htm#fn94"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> that the Son of Man<a name="fnB95" href="mar_note.htm#fn95"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> has authority on earth to forgive sins,"--he said to the paralytic<a name="fnB96" href="mar_note.htm#fn96"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a>-- 
<bqverse 11>11  "I tell you, stand up, take your stretcher, and go home."<a name="fnB97" href="mar_note.htm#fn97"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  And immediately the man<a name="fnB98" href="mar_note.htm#fn98"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> stood up, took his stretcher, and went out in front of them all. They were all amazed and glorified God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!"<a name="_Toc403221427"></a><a name="_Toc416893915"></a><a name="_Toc432264775"></a><a name="_Toc485059715"></a><a name="_Toc494013212"></a></p>
<p><i>The Call of Levi and Eating with Sinners </i>
<p>
<bqverse 13>13  Jesus<a name="fnB99" href="mar_note.htm#fn99"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> went out again by the sea. The whole crowd came to him, and he taught them. 
<bqverse 14>14  As he went along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax booth.<a name="fnB100" href="mar_note.htm#fn100"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> "Follow me," he said to him. And he got up and followed him. 
<bqverse 15>15  As Jesus<a name="fnB101" href="mar_note.htm#fn101"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> was having a meal<a name="fnB102" href="mar_note.htm#fn102"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> in Levi's<a name="fnB103" href="mar_note.htm#fn103"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> home, many tax collectors<a name="fnB104" href="mar_note.htm#fn104"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> and sinners were eating with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. 
<bqverse 16>16  When the experts in the law<a name="fnB105" href="mar_note.htm#fn105"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> and the Pharisees<a name="fnB106" href="mar_note.htm#fn106"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"<a name="fnB107" href="mar_note.htm#fn107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  When Jesus heard this he said to them, "Those who are healthy don't need a physician, but those who are sick do.<a name="fnB108" href="mar_note.htm#fn108"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> I have not come to call the righteous but sinners."<a name="_Toc432264776"></a><a name="_Toc485059716"></a><a name="_Toc494013213"></a></p>

<bqverse 3>3  "Listen! A sower went out to sow.<a name="fnB192" href="mar_note.htm#fn192"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 6>6  When the sun came up it was scorched, and because it did not have a root, it withered.

<bqverse 15>15 These are the ones on the path where the word is sown: whenever they hear, immediately Satan<a name="fnB203" href="mar_note.htm#fn203"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> comes and snatches the word<a name="fnB204" href="mar_note.htm#fn204"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> that was sown in them.

<bqverse 26>26  He also said, "The kingdom of God is like someone who spread seed on the ground. 
<bqverse 27>27  He goes to sleep and gets up, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.
<bqverse 28>28  By itself the soil produces a crop, first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head. 
<bqverse 29>29  And when the grain is ripe, he sends in the sickle because the harvest has come."<a name="fnB218" href="mar_note.htm#fn218"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc403221439"></a><a name="_Toc416893927"></a><a name="_Toc432264787"></a><a name="_Toc485059727"></a><a name="_Toc494013224"></a></p>
<p><i>The Parable of the Mustard Seed </i>
<p>
<bqverse 30>30 He also asked, "To what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable can we use to present it? 
<bqverse 31>31  It is like a mustard seed,<a name="fnB219" href="mar_note.htm#fn219"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> that when placed on the ground is the smallest of all the seeds scattered on the ground.

<bqverse 2>2  Just as Jesus<a name="fnB238" href="mar_note.htm#fn238"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> was getting out of the boat, a man from the tombs with an unclean spirit<a name="fnB239" href="mar_note.htm#fn239"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> met him. 
<bqverse 3>3  He lived among the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain. 
<bqverse 4>4  For his hands and feet had often been bound with chains and shackles,<a name="fnB240" href="mar_note.htm#fn240"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> but<a name="fnB241" href="mar_note.htm#fn241"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> he had torn the chains apart and broken the shackles in pieces. No one was strong enough to subdue him.
<bqverse 5>5 Each night and every day among the tombs and in the mountains, he would cry out and cut himself with stones. 
<bqverse 6>6  When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed down before him. 
<bqverse 7>7  Then<a name="fnB242" href="mar_note.htm#fn242"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> he cried out with a loud voice, "Leave me alone,<a name="fnB243" href="mar_note.htm#fn243"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> Jesus, Son of the Most High God! I implore you by God<a name="fnB244" href="mar_note.htm#fn244"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a>--do not torment me!" 
<bqverse 8>8  (For Jesus<a name="fnB245" href="mar_note.htm#fn245"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> had said to him, "Come out of that man, you unclean spirit!")<a name="fnB246" href="mar_note.htm#fn246"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  Jesus<a name="fnB247" href="mar_note.htm#fn247"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> asked him, "What is your name?" And he said, "My name is Legion,<a name="fnB248" href="mar_note.htm#fn248"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> for we are many." 
<bqverse 10>10  He begged Jesus<a name="fnB249" href="mar_note.htm#fn249"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> repeatedly not to send them out of the region.
<bqverse 11>11  There on the hillside,<a name="fnB250" href="mar_note.htm#fn250"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> a great herd of pigs was feeding.
<bqverse 12>12  And the spirits<a name="fnB251" href="mar_note.htm#fn251"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> begged him, "Send us into the pigs. Let us enter them." 
<bqverse 13>13  Jesus<a name="fnB252" href="mar_note.htm#fn252"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> gave them permission.<a name="fnB253" href="mar_note.htm#fn253"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> So<a name="fnB254" href="mar_note.htm#fn254"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs. Then the<sup><sub> </sub></sup>herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake, and about two thousand were drowned in the lake. <p>

<bqverse 14>14  Now<a name="fnB255" href="mar_note.htm#fn255"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> the herdsmen ran off and spread the news in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. 
<bqverse 15>15  They came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting there, clothed and in his right mind--the one who had the legion--and they were afraid. 
<bqverse 16>16 Those who had seen what had happened to the demon-possessed man reported it, and they also told about the pigs.
<bqverse 17>17  Then<a name="fnB256" href="mar_note.htm#fn256"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> they asked Jesus<a name="fnB257" href="mar_note.htm#fn257"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> to leave their region. 
<bqverse 18>18  As he was getting into the boat the man who had been demon-possessed asked if he could go with him. 
<bqverse 19>19  But<a name="fnB258" href="mar_note.htm#fn258"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> Jesus<a name="fnB259" href="mar_note.htm#fn259"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> did not permit him.

<p><i>Restoration and Healing </i>
<p>
<bqverse 21>21  When Jesus had crossed again in a boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around him, and he was by the sea. 
<bqverse 22>22  Then<a name="fnB264" href="mar_note.htm#fn264"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> one of the synagogue rulers,<a name="fnB265" href="mar_note.htm#fn265"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> named Jairus,<a name="fnB266" href="mar_note.htm#fn266"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> came and when he saw him he fell at his feet. 
<bqverse 23>23  He asked him urgently, "My little daughter is near death. Come and lay your hands on her so that she may be healed and live."
<bqverse 24>24  Jesus<a name="fnB267" href="mar_note.htm#fn267"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> went with him, and a large crowd followed and pressed around him.<p>

<bqverse 25>25  Now<a name="fnB268" href="mar_note.htm#fn268"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> a woman was there who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years.<a name="fnB269" href="mar_note.htm#fn269"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  She had endured a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all that she had. Yet instead of getting better, she grew worse. 
<bqverse 27>27  When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,<a name="fnB270" href="mar_note.htm#fn270"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28 for she kept saying,<a name="fnB271" href="mar_note.htm#fn271"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> "If only I touch his clothes, I will be healed."<a name="fnB272" href="mar_note.htm#fn272"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 29>29  At once the bleeding stopped,<a name="fnB273" href="mar_note.htm#fn273"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. 
<bqverse 30>30  Jesus knew at once that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and said, "Who touched my clothes?" 
<bqverse 31>31  His disciples said to him, "You see the crowd pressing against you and you say, `Who touched me?'"
<bqverse 32>32  But<a name="fnB274" href="mar_note.htm#fn274"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> he looked around to see who had done it. 
<bqverse 33>33  Then the woman, with fear and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth. 
<bqverse 34>34  He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well.<a name="fnB275" href="mar_note.htm#fn275"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> Go in peace, and be healed of your disease."<p>

<bqverse 35>35  While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler's<a name="fnB276" href="mar_note.htm#fn276"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> house saying, "Your daughter has died. Why trouble the teacher any longer?" 
<bqverse 36>36  But Jesus, paying no attention to what was said, told the synagogue ruler, "Do not be afraid; just believe." 
<bqverse 37>37  He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James,<a name="fnB277" href="mar_note.htm#fn277"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> and John, the brother of James. 
<bqverse 38>38  They came to the house of the synagogue ruler where<a name="fnB278" href="mar_note.htm#fn278"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> he saw noisy confusion and people weeping and wailing loudly.<a name="fnB279" href="mar_note.htm#fn279"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 39>39  When he entered he said to them, "Why are you distressed and weeping? The child is not dead but asleep." 
<bqverse 40>40  And they began making fun of him.<a name="fnB280" href="mar_note.htm#fn280"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> But he put them all outside<a name="fnB281" href="mar_note.htm#fn281"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> and he took the child's father and mother and his own companions<a name="fnB282" href="mar_note.htm#fn282"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> and went into the room where the child was.<a name="fnB283" href="mar_note.htm#fn283"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 41>41  Then, gently taking the child by the hand, he said to her, "<i>Talitha cum</i>," which means, "Little girl, I say to you, get up." 
<bqverse 42>42  The girl got up at once and began to walk about (she was twelve years old). They were completely astonished at this. 
<bqverse 43>43  He strictly ordered that no one should know about this,<a name="fnB284" href="mar_note.htm#fn284"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> and told them to give her something to eat.

<bqverse 5>5  He was not able to do a miracle there, except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. 
<bqverse 6>6  And he was amazed because of their unbelief.

<bqverse 8>8  He instructed them to take nothing for the journey except a staff<a name="fnB295" href="mar_note.htm#fn295"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a>--no bread, no bag,<a name="fnB296" href="mar_note.htm#fn296"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> no money in their belts--

<bqverse 16>16  But when Herod heard this, he said, "John, whom I beheaded, has been raised." 
<bqverse 17>17 For Herod himself had sent men, arrested John, and bound him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because Herod had married her;

<bqverse 19>19  So Herodias nursed a grudge against him and wanted to kill him. But<a name="fnB308" href="mar_note.htm#fn308"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> she could not 
<bqverse 20>20 because Herod stood in awe of<a name="fnB309" href="mar_note.htm#fn309"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> John and protected him, since he knew that John<a name="fnB310" href="mar_note.htm#fn310"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> was a righteous and holy man. When he heard him, he was thoroughly baffled,<a name="fnB311" href="mar_note.htm#fn311"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> and yet<a name="fnB312" href="mar_note.htm#fn312"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> he liked to listen to him. <p>

<bqverse 21>21  But<a name="fnB313" href="mar_note.htm#fn313"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> a day of opportunity came, when Herod gave a banquet on his birthday for his court officials, military commanders, and leaders of Galilee. 
<bqverse 22>22  When his daughter Herodias<a name="fnB314" href="mar_note.htm#fn314"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, "Ask me for whatever you want and I will give it to you." 
<bqverse 23>23  He swore insistently, "Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom."<a name="fnB315" href="mar_note.htm#fn315"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  So<a name="fnB316" href="mar_note.htm#fn316"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> she went out and said to her mother, "What should I ask for?" Her mother<a name="fnB317" href="mar_note.htm#fn317"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> said, "The head of John the baptizer."<a name="fnB318" href="mar_note.htm#fn318"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  Immediately she hurried back to the king and made her request:<a name="fnB319" href="mar_note.htm#fn319"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> "I want the head of John the Baptist on a platter immediately." 
<bqverse 26>26  Although it grieved the king deeply,<a name="fnB320" href="mar_note.htm#fn320"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> he did not want to reject her request because of his oath and his guests. 
<bqverse 27>27  So<a name="fnB321" href="mar_note.htm#fn321"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> the king sent an executioner at once to bring John's<a name="fnB322" href="mar_note.htm#fn322"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> head, and he went and beheaded John in prison. 
<bqverse 28>28  He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.
<bqverse 29>29  When John's<a name="fnB323" href="mar_note.htm#fn323"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> disciples heard this, they came and took his body and placed it in a tomb.<a name="_Toc403221447"></a><a name="_Toc416893935"></a><a name="_Toc485059735"></a><a name="_Toc494013232"></a></p>
<p><i>The Feeding of the Five Thousand</i>
<p>
<bqverse 30>30 Then<a name="fnB324" href="mar_note.htm#fn324"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> the apostles gathered around Jesus and told him everything they had done and taught. 
<bqverse 31>31  He said to them, "Come with me privately to an isolated place and rest a while" (for many were coming and going, and there was no time to eat).
<bqverse 32>32 So they went away by themselves in a boat to some remote place. 
<bqverse 33>33  But many saw them leaving and recognized them, and they hurried on foot<a name="fnB325" href="mar_note.htm#fn325"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> from all the towns<a name="fnB326" href="mar_note.htm#fn326"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> and arrived there ahead of them.<a name="fnB327" href="mar_note.htm#fn327"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 34>34 As Jesus<a name="fnB328" href="mar_note.htm#fn328"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> came ashore<a name="fnB329" href="mar_note.htm#fn329"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> he saw the large crowd and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So<a name="fnB330" href="mar_note.htm#fn330"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> he taught them many things.<p>

<bqverse 35>35  When it became late, his disciples came to him and said, "This is an isolated place<a name="fnB331" href="mar_note.htm#fn331"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> and it is already very late. 
<bqverse 36>36  Send them away so that they can go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy something for themselves to eat." 
<bqverse 37>37 But he answered them,<a name="fnB332" href="mar_note.htm#fn332"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> "You<a name="fnB333" href="mar_note.htm#fn333"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> give them something to eat." And they said, "Should we go and buy bread for two hundred silver coins<a name="fnB334" href="mar_note.htm#fn334"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> and give it to them to eat?" 
<bqverse 38>38  And he said to them, "How many loaves do you have? Go and see." When they found out they said, "Five--and two fish." 
<bqverse 39>39  Then he directed them all to sit down in groups on the green grass.
<bqverse 40>40  So they reclined in groups of hundreds and fifties.
<bqverse 41>41  He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the bread. He<a name="fnB335" href="mar_note.htm#fn335"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> gave them to his disciples to serve the people, and he divided the two fish among them all. 
<bqverse 42>42  They all ate and were satisfied, 
<bqverse 43>43  and they picked up the broken pieces and fish left over, twelve baskets full.
<bqverse 44>44  Now<a name="fnB336" href="mar_note.htm#fn336"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> there were five thousand men<a name="fnB337" href="mar_note.htm#fn337"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> who ate the bread.<a name="fnB338" href="mar_note.htm#fn338"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc403221448"></a><a name="_Toc416893936"></a><a name="_Toc432264796"></a><a name="_Toc485059736"></a><a name="_Toc494013233"></a></p>
<p><i>Walking on Water </i>
<p>
<bqverse 45>45  Immediately Jesus<a name="fnB339" href="mar_note.htm#fn339"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dispersed the crowd. 
<bqverse 46>46  After saying good-bye to them, he went to the mountain to pray. 
<bqverse 47>47 When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea and he was alone on the land.
<bqverse 48>48  He<a name="fnB340" href="mar_note.htm#fn340"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> saw them straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. As the night was ending,<a name="fnB341" href="mar_note.htm#fn341"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> he came to them walking on the sea<a name="fnB342" href="mar_note.htm#fn342"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> for<a name="fnB343" href="mar_note.htm#fn343"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> he wanted to pass by them.<a name="fnB344" href="mar_note.htm#fn344"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 49>49  When they saw him walking on the water<a name="fnB345" href="mar_note.htm#fn345"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> they thought he was a ghost. They<a name="fnB346" href="mar_note.htm#fn346"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> cried out, 
<bqverse 50>50  for they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them:<a name="fnB347" href="mar_note.htm#fn347"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> "Have courage! It is I. Do not be afraid." 
<bqverse 51>51  Then he went up with them into the boat, and the wind ceased. They were completely astonished, 
<bqverse 52>52  because they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.<a name="_Toc403221449"></a><a name="_Toc416893937"></a><a name="_Toc432264797"></a><a name="_Toc485059737"></a><a name="_Toc494013234"></a></p>
<p><i>Healing the Sick </i>
<p>
<bqverse 53>53  After they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret<a name="fnB348" href="mar_note.htm#fn348"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> and anchored there. 
<bqverse 54>54  As they got out of the boat, people immediately recognized Jesus.<a name="fnB349" href="mar_note.htm#fn349"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 55>55  They ran through that whole region and began to bring the sick on mats to wherever he was rumored to be.<a name="fnB350" href="mar_note.htm#fn350"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 56>56  And wherever he would go--into villages, towns, or countryside--they would place the sick in the marketplaces, and would ask him if<a name="fnB351" href="mar_note.htm#fn351"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> they could just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.

<p><i>Breaking Man-Made Traditions </i>

<bqverse 1>1 </b> Now<a name="fnB352" href="mar_note.htm#fn352"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> the Pharisees<a name="fnB353" href="mar_note.htm#fn353"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> and some of the experts in the law<a name="fnB354" href="mar_note.htm#fn354"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> who came from Jerusalem gathered to him. 
<bqverse 2>2  And they saw that some of Jesus' disciples ate their bread with unclean hands, that is, unwashed. 
<bqverse 3>3  (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they perform a ritual washing,<a name="fnB355" href="mar_note.htm#fn355"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> holding on to the tradition of the elders. 
<bqverse 4>4  And when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. They hold on to many other traditions: the washing of cups, pots, kettles, and dining couches.)<a name="fnB356" href="mar_note.htm#fn356"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  The Pharisees and the experts in the law asked him, "Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat<a name="fnB357" href="mar_note.htm#fn357"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> with unwashed hands?" 
<bqverse 6>6 He said to them, "Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written:</p>
<br><b><i>`<b><i>This people honors me with their lips,</i></b><br>

<bqverse 9>9  He also said to them, "You neatly reject the commandment of God in order to set up<a name="fnB361" href="mar_note.htm#fn361"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> your tradition. 
<bqverse 10>10  For Moses said, `<b><i>Honor your father and your mother</i></b>,'<a name="fnB362" href="mar_note.htm#fn362"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> and, `<b><i>Whoever insults his father or mother must be put to death</i></b><i>.</i>'<a name="fnB363" href="mar_note.htm#fn363"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  But you say that if anyone tells his father or mother, `Whatever help you would have received from me is <i>corban</i>'<a name="fnB364" href="mar_note.htm#fn364"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> (that is, a gift for God),
<bqverse 12>12  then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother. 
<bqverse 13>13  Thus you nullify<a name="fnB365" href="mar_note.htm#fn365"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like this."</p>
<p>
<bqverse 14>14  Then<a name="fnB366" href="mar_note.htm#fn366"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> he called the crowd again and said to them, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand.

<bqverse 18>18  He said to them, "Are you so foolish? Don't you understand that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him?

<bqverse 20>20  He said, "What comes out of a person defiles him. 
<bqverse 21>21  For from within, out of the human heart, comes evil ideas, sexual immorality, theft, murder, 
<bqverse 22>22  adultery, greed, evil, deceit, debauchery, envy, slander, pride, and folly.

<bqverse 11>11  Then the Pharisees<a name="fnB396" href="mar_note.htm#fn396"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> came and began to argue with Jesus, asking for<a name="fnB397" href="mar_note.htm#fn397"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> a sign from heaven<a name="fnB398" href="mar_note.htm#fn398"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> to test him.
<bqverse 12>12  Sighing deeply in his spirit he said, "Why does this generation look for a sign? I tell you the truth,<a name="fnB399" href="mar_note.htm#fn399"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> no sign will be given to this generation."

<bqverse 15>15  And Jesus<a name="fnB402" href="mar_note.htm#fn402"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> gave them orders, saying, "Watch out!

<bqverse 16>16  So they began to discuss with one another about having no bread.<a name="fnB404" href="mar_note.htm#fn404"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  When he learned of this,<a name="fnB405" href="mar_note.htm#fn405"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> Jesus said to them, "Why are you arguing<a name="fnB406" href="mar_note.htm#fn406"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Have your hearts been hardened?

<bqverse 19>19  When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of pieces did you pick up?" They said, "Twelve." 
<bqverse 20>20  "When I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many baskets full of pieces did you pick up?" They said, "Seven." 
<bqverse 21>21 Then<a name="fnB408" href="mar_note.htm#fn408"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> he said to them, "Do you still not understand?"<a name="fnB409" href="mar_note.htm#fn409"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc403221456"></a><a name="_Toc416893944"></a><a name="_Toc432264804"></a><a name="_Toc485059744"></a><a name="_Toc494013241"></a></p>

<bqverse 23>23  He took the blind man by the hand and brought him outside of the village.

<bqverse 24>24  Regaining his sight<a name="fnB414" href="mar_note.htm#fn414"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> he said, "I see people, but they look like trees walking." 
<bqverse 25>25  Then Jesus<a name="fnB415" href="mar_note.htm#fn415"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> placed his hands on the man's<a name="fnB416" href="mar_note.htm#fn416"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> eyes again; then he opened his eyes, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. 
<bqverse 26>26  Jesus<a name="fnB417" href="mar_note.htm#fn417"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> sent him home, saying, "Do not even go into the village."<a name="fnB418" href="mar_note.htm#fn418"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc403221457"></a><a name="_Toc416893945"></a><a name="_Toc432264805"></a><a name="_Toc485059745"></a><a name="_Toc494013242"></a></p>

<p><i>The Transfiguration </i>
<p>
<bqverse 2>2  And after six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John and led them alone up a high mountain privately. And he was transfigured before them,<a name="fnB446" href="mar_note.htm#fn446"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  and his clothes became radiantly white, more than any launderer in the world could bleach them. 
<bqverse 4>4  Then Elijah appeared before them along with Moses,<a name="fnB447" href="mar_note.htm#fn447"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> and they were talking with Jesus. 
<bqverse 5>5  Then<a name="fnB448" href="mar_note.htm#fn448"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> Peter said to Jesus,<a name="fnB449" href="mar_note.htm#fn449"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here.

<bqverse 6>6  (For they were afraid, and he did not know what to say.)<a name="fnB451" href="mar_note.htm#fn451"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 8>8  Suddenly when they looked around, they saw no one with them any more except Jesus.<p>

<bqverse 9>9  As they were coming down from the mountain, he gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead. 
<bqverse 10>10  They kept this statement to themselves, discussing what this rising from the dead meant. <p>

<bqverse 11>11 Then<a name="fnB458" href="mar_note.htm#fn458"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> they asked him,<a name="fnB459" href="mar_note.htm#fn459"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> "Why do the experts in the law<a name="fnB460" href="mar_note.htm#fn460"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> say that Elijah must come first?"

<bqverse 14>14  When they came to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and experts in the law<a name="fnB461" href="mar_note.htm#fn461"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> arguing with them. 
<bqverse 15>15  When the whole crowd saw him they were amazed and ran<a name="fnB462" href="mar_note.htm#fn462"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> at once and greeted him. 
<bqverse 16>16  He asked them, "What are you arguing about with them?" 
<bqverse 17>17  A member of the crowd said to him, "Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that makes him mute. 
<bqverse 18>18  Whenever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to cast it out, but<a name="fnB463" href="mar_note.htm#fn463"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> they were not able to do it." 
<bqverse 19>19  He answered them,<a name="fnB464" href="mar_note.htm#fn464"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> "You<a name="fnB465" href="mar_note.htm#fn465"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> unbelieving<a name="fnB466" href="mar_note.htm#fn466"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> generation!

<bqverse 20>20  So they brought the boy<a name="fnB470" href="mar_note.htm#fn470"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> to him. When the spirit saw him, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He<a name="fnB471" href="mar_note.htm#fn471"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> fell on the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth. 
<bqverse 21>21  Jesus<a name="fnB472" href="mar_note.htm#fn472"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> asked his father, "How long has this been happening to him?" And he said, "From childhood. 
<bqverse 22>22  It has often thrown him into fire or water to destroy him. But if you are able to do anything, have compassion on us and help us." 
<bqverse 23>23  Then Jesus said to him, "`If you are able?' All things are possible for the one who believes." 
<bqverse 24>24  Immediately the father of the boy cried out and said, "I believe; help my unbelief!"<p>

<bqverse 25>25  Now when Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly gathering, he rebuked<a name="fnB473" href="mar_note.htm#fn473"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> the unclean spirit,<a name="fnB474" href="mar_note.htm#fn474"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> saying to it, "Mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again." 
<bqverse 26>26  It shrieked, threw him into terrible convulsions, and came out. The boy<a name="fnB475" href="mar_note.htm#fn475"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> looked so much like a corpse that many said, "He is dead!" 
<bqverse 27>27  But Jesus gently took his hand and raised him to his feet, and he stood up.<p>

<bqverse 28>28  Then,<a name="fnB476" href="mar_note.htm#fn476"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> after he went into the house, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn't we cast it out?"

<bqverse 29>29  Jesus said to them, "I will ask you one question. Answer me and I will tell you by what authority I do these things:

<bqverse 31>31  They discussed with one another, saying, "If we say, `From heaven,' he will say, `Then why did you not believe him?' 
<bqverse 32>32  But if we say, `From men--'" (they feared the crowd, for they all considered John to be truly a prophet).

<bqverse 31>31 But Peter<a name="fnB786" href="mar_note.htm#fn786"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> insisted emphatically,<a name="fnB787" href="mar_note.htm#fn787"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> "Even if I must die with you, I will never deny you."

<p><i>Gethsemane </i>
<p>
<bqverse 32>32  Then<a name="fnB788" href="mar_note.htm#fn788"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> they went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus<a name="fnB789" href="mar_note.htm#fn789"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray." 
<bqverse 33>33  He took Peter, James,<a name="fnB790" href="mar_note.htm#fn790"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> and John with him, and became very troubled and distressed. 
<bqverse 34>34  He said to them, "My soul is deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Remain here and stay alert." 
<bqverse 35>35  Going a little farther, he threw himself to the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour would pass from him. 
<bqverse 36>36  He said, "Abba,<a name="fnB791" href="mar_note.htm#fn791"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> Father, all things are possible for you. Take this cup away from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will." 
<bqverse 37>37  Then<a name="fnB792" href="mar_note.htm#fn792"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> he came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "Simon, are you sleeping? Couldn't you stay awake for one hour? 
<bqverse 38>38  Stay awake and pray that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." 
<bqverse 39>39  He went away again and prayed the same thing. 
<bqverse 40>40  When he came again he found them sleeping; they could not keep their eyes open.<a name="fnB793" href="mar_note.htm#fn793"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> And they did not know what to tell him. 
<bqverse 41>41  He came a third time and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting?<a name="fnB794" href="mar_note.htm#fn794"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> Enough of that!<a name="fnB795" href="mar_note.htm#fn795"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> The hour has come.

<bqverse 42>42  Get up, let us go. Look!

<p><i>Betrayal and Arrest </i>
<p>
<bqverse 43>43  Right away, while Jesus<a name="fnB797" href="mar_note.htm#fn797"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived. With him came a crowd armed with swords and clubs, and sent by the chief priests and experts in the law<a name="fnB798" href="mar_note.htm#fn798"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> and elders. 
<bqverse 44>44 (Now the betrayer<a name="fnB799" href="mar_note.htm#fn799"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> had given them a sign, saying, "The one I kiss is the man.<b> </b>Arrest him and lead him away under guard.")<a name="fnB800" href="mar_note.htm#fn800"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 45>45  When Judas<a name="fnB801" href="mar_note.htm#fn801"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> came, he went to Jesus<a name="fnB802" href="mar_note.htm#fn802"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> immediately and said, "Rabbi!" and kissed<a name="fnB803" href="mar_note.htm#fn803"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> him. 
<bqverse 46>46  Then they took hold of him<a name="fnB804" href="mar_note.htm#fn804"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> and arrested him.
<bqverse 47>47  One of the bystanders drew his sword and struck the high priest's slave,<a name="fnB805" href="mar_note.htm#fn805"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> cutting off his ear. 
<bqverse 48>48  Jesus said to them, "Have you come with swords and clubs to arrest me like you would an outlaw?<a name="fnB806" href="mar_note.htm#fn806"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 49>49  Day after day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, yet<a name="fnB807" href="mar_note.htm#fn807"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> you did not arrest me. But this has happened so that<a name="fnB808" href="mar_note.htm#fn808"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a> the scriptures would be fulfilled." 
<bqverse 50>50  Then<a name="fnB809" href="mar_note.htm#fn809"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>69</SUP></FONT></a> all the disciples<a name="fnB810" href="mar_note.htm#fn810"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>70</SUP></FONT></a> left him and fled. 
<bqverse 51>51  A young man was following him, wearing only a linen cloth. They tried to arrest him, 
<bqverse 52>52  but he ran off naked,<a name="fnB811" href="mar_note.htm#fn811"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>71</SUP></FONT></a> leaving his linen cloth behind.<a name="_Toc403221500"></a><a name="_Toc416893988"></a><a name="_Toc432264846"></a><a name="_Toc485059786"></a><a name="_Toc494013283"></a></p>
<p><i>Condemned by the Sanhedrin </i>
<p>
<bqverse 53>53  Then<a name="fnB812" href="mar_note.htm#fn812"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>72</SUP></FONT></a> they led Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests and elders and experts in the law<a name="fnB813" href="mar_note.htm#fn813"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>73</SUP></FONT></a> came together. 
<bqverse 54>54  And Peter had followed him from a distance, up to the courtyard of the high priest. He<a name="fnB814" href="mar_note.htm#fn814"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>74</SUP></FONT></a> was sitting with the guards<a name="fnB815" href="mar_note.htm#fn815"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>75</SUP></FONT></a> and warming himself by the fire. 
<bqverse 55>55  The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find anything. 
<bqverse 56>56  Many gave false testimony against him, but their testimony did not agree. 
<bqverse 57>57  Some stood up and gave this false testimony against him:<a name="fnB816" href="mar_note.htm#fn816"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>76</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 58>58  "We heard him say, `I will destroy this temple made with hands and in three days build another not made with hands.'" 
<bqverse 59>59  Yet even on this point their testimony did not agree. 
<bqverse 60>60  Then<a name="fnB817" href="mar_note.htm#fn817"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>77</SUP></FONT></a> the high priest stood up before them<a name="fnB818" href="mar_note.htm#fn818"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>78</SUP></FONT></a> and asked Jesus, "Have you no answer? What is this that they are testifying against you?" 
<bqverse 61>61  But he was silent and did not answer. Again the high priest questioned him,<a name="fnB819" href="mar_note.htm#fn819"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>79</SUP></FONT></a> "Are you the Christ,<a name="fnB820" href="mar_note.htm#fn820"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>80</SUP></FONT></a> the Son of the Blessed One?" 
<bqverse 62>62  "I am," said Jesus, "and you will see <i>the Son of Man sitting at the right hand</i><a name="fnB821" href="mar_note.htm#fn821"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>81</SUP></FONT></a><i> </i>of the Power<a name="fnB822" href="mar_note.htm#fn822"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>82</SUP></FONT></a> and <i>coming with the clouds of heaven</i>."<a name="fnB823" href="mar_note.htm#fn823"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>83</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 63>63  Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "Why do we still need witnesses? 
<bqverse 64>64  You have heard the blasphemy! What is your verdict?"<a name="fnB824" href="mar_note.htm#fn824"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>84</SUP></FONT></a> They all condemned him as deserving death. 
<bqverse 65>65 Then<a name="fnB825" href="mar_note.htm#fn825"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>85</SUP></FONT></a> some began to spit on him, and to blindfold him, and strike him with their fists, saying, "Prophesy!"

<p><i>Peter</i>'<i>s Denials </i>

<bqverse 66>66  Now<a name="fnB827" href="mar_note.htm#fn827"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>87</SUP></FONT></a> while Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the high priest's slave girls<a name="fnB828" href="mar_note.htm#fn828"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>88</SUP></FONT></a> came by. 
<bqverse 67>67  When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked directly at him and said, "You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus."
<bqverse 68>68  But he denied it:<a name="fnB829" href="mar_note.htm#fn829"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>89</SUP></FONT></a> "I don't even understand what you're talking about."<a name="fnB830" href="mar_note.htm#fn830"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>90</SUP></FONT></a> Then<a name="fnB831" href="mar_note.htm#fn831"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>91</SUP></FONT></a> he went out to the gateway, and a rooster crowed.<a name="fnB832" href="mar_note.htm#fn832"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>92</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 69>69  When the slave girl saw him, she began again to say to the bystanders, "This man is one of them." 
<bqverse 70>70  But he denied it again. A short time later the bystanders again said to Peter, "You must be<a name="fnB833" href="mar_note.htm#fn833"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>93</SUP></FONT></a> one of them, because you are also a Galilean." 
<bqverse 71>71  Then he began to curse, and he swore with an oath, "I do not know this man you are talking about!"
<bqverse 72>72  Immediately the rooster crowed a second time. Then<a name="fnB834" href="mar_note.htm#fn834"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>94</SUP></FONT></a> Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."

<p><i>Jesus Brought Before Pilate </i>
<p><A NAME="15"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Early in the morning, after forming a plan, the chief priests with the elders and the experts in the law<a name="fnB836" href="mar_note.htm#fn836"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> and the whole Sanhedrin tied Jesus up, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate.<a name="fnB837" href="mar_note.htm#fn837"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  So<a name="fnB838" href="mar_note.htm#fn838"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> Pilate asked him, "Are you the king<a name="fnB839" href="mar_note.htm#fn839"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> of the Jews?" He replied,<a name="fnB840" href="mar_note.htm#fn840"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> "You say so."<a name="fnB841" href="mar_note.htm#fn841"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  Then<a name="fnB842" href="mar_note.htm#fn842"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> the chief priests began to accuse him repeatedly. 
<bqverse 4>4  So Pilate asked him again,<a name="fnB843" href="mar_note.htm#fn843"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> "Have you nothing to say? See how many charges they are bringing against you!" 
<bqverse 5>5  But Jesus made no further reply, so that Pilate was amazed. <a name="_Toc403221503"></a><a name="_Toc416893991"></a><a name="_Toc432264849"></a><a name="_Toc485059789"></a><a name="_Toc494013286"></a></p>
<p><i>Jesus and Barabbas </i>
<p>
<bqverse 6>6  During the feast<b> </b>it was customary to release one prisoner to the people,<a name="fnB844" href="mar_note.htm#fn844"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> whomever they requested. 
<bqverse 7>7  A man named Barabbas was imprisoned with rebels who had committed murder during an insurrection. 
<bqverse 8>8  Then the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to release a prisoner for them, as was his custom.<a name="fnB845" href="mar_note.htm#fn845"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  So Pilate asked them,<a name="fnB846" href="mar_note.htm#fn846"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> "Do you want me to release the king of the Jews for you?" 
<bqverse 10>10  (For he knew that the chief priests had handed him over because of envy.)<a name="fnB847" href="mar_note.htm#fn847"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 11>11  But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release<a name="fnB848" href="mar_note.htm#fn848"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> Barabbas instead. 
<bqverse 12>12  So Pilate spoke to them again,<a name="fnB849" href="mar_note.htm#fn849"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> "Then what do you want me to do with the one you call king of the Jews?" 
<bqverse 13>13  They shouted back, "Crucify<a name="fnB850" href="mar_note.htm#fn850"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> him!"
<bqverse 14>14  Pilate asked them, "Why? What has he done wrong?" But they shouted more insistently, "Crucify him!"
<bqverse 15>15 Because he wanted to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas for them. Then<a name="fnB851" href="mar_note.htm#fn851"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> after he had Jesus flogged<a name="fnB852" href="mar_note.htm#fn852"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> he handed him over<a name="fnB853" href="mar_note.htm#fn853"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> to be crucified.<a name="_Toc403221504"></a><a name="_Toc416893992"></a><a name="_Toc432264850"></a><a name="_Toc485059790"></a><a name="_Toc494013287"></a></p>

<bqverse 17>17 They put a purple cloak<a name="fnB857" href="mar_note.htm#fn857"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> on him and after braiding<a name="fnB858" href="mar_note.htm#fn858"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> a crown of thorns,<a name="fnB859" href="mar_note.htm#fn859"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> they put it on him.

<bqverse 23>23  They offered him wine mixed with myrrh,<a name="fnB872" href="mar_note.htm#fn872"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> but he did not take it. 
<bqverse 24>24  Then<a name="fnB873" href="mar_note.htm#fn873"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> they crucified<a name="fnB874" href="mar_note.htm#fn874"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> him and divided his clothes, throwing dice<a name="fnB875" href="mar_note.htm#fn875"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> for them, to decide what each would take.

<bqverse 33>33  Now<a name="fnB884" href="mar_note.htm#fn884"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> when it was noon,<a name="fnB885" href="mar_note.htm#fn885"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> darkness came over the whole land<a name="fnB886" href="mar_note.htm#fn886"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> until three in the afternoon.<a name="fnB887" href="mar_note.htm#fn887"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 34>34  Around three o'clock<a name="fnB888" href="mar_note.htm#fn888"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> Jesus cried out with a loud voice, "<i>Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?</i>" which means, "<b><i>My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</i></b>"<a name="fnB889" href="mar_note.htm#fn889"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 35>35  When some of the bystanders heard it they said, "Listen, he is calling for Elijah!"<a name="fnB890" href="mar_note.htm#fn890"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 36>36  Then someone ran, filled a sponge with sour wine,<a name="fnB891" href="mar_note.htm#fn891"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> put it on a stick,<a name="fnB892" href="mar_note.htm#fn892"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Leave him alone! Let's see if Elijah will come to take him down!" 
<bqverse 37>37  But Jesus<b> </b>cried out with a loud voice and breathed his last.
<bqverse 38>38  And the temple curtain<a name="fnB893" href="mar_note.htm#fn893"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> was torn in two, from top to bottom. 
<bqverse 39>39  Now when the centurion,<a name="fnB894" href="mar_note.htm#fn894"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> who stood in front of him, saw how he died,<a name="fnB895" href="mar_note.htm#fn895"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> he said, "Truly this man was God's Son!"
<bqverse 40>40 There were also women, watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses,<a name="fnB896" href="mar_note.htm#fn896"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> and Salome. 
<bqverse 41>41  When he was in Galilee, they had followed him and given him support.<a name="fnB897" href="mar_note.htm#fn897"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were there too.<a name="_Toc403221507"></a><a name="_Toc416893995"></a><a name="_Toc432264853"></a><a name="_Toc485059793"></a><a name="_Toc494013290"></a></p>

<bqverse 42>42  Now<a name="fnB898" href="mar_note.htm#fn898"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> when evening had already come, since it was the day of preparation (that is, the day before the Sabbath),<a name="fnB899" href="mar_note.htm#fn899"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 43>43  Joseph of Arimathea, a highly regarded member of the council,<a name="fnB900" href="mar_note.htm#fn900"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> who was himself looking forward to<a name="fnB901" href="mar_note.htm#fn901"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a> the kingdom of God,<a name="fnB902" href="mar_note.htm#fn902"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> went boldly to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.<a name="fnB903" href="mar_note.htm#fn903"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 44>44  Pilate was surprised that he was already dead. He<a name="fnB904" href="mar_note.htm#fn904"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>69</SUP></FONT></a> called the centurion and asked him if he had been dead for some time.
<bqverse 45>45  When Pilate<a name="fnB905" href="mar_note.htm#fn905"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>70</SUP></FONT></a> was informed by the centurion,<a name="fnB906" href="mar_note.htm#fn906"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>71</SUP></FONT></a> he gave the body to Joseph. 
<bqverse 46>46  After Joseph<a name="fnB907" href="mar_note.htm#fn907"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>72</SUP></FONT></a> bought a linen cloth<a name="fnB908" href="mar_note.htm#fn908"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>73</SUP></FONT></a> and took down the body, he wrapped it in the linen and placed it in a tomb cut out of the rock.<a name="fnB909" href="mar_note.htm#fn909"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>74</SUP></FONT></a> Then<a name="fnB910" href="mar_note.htm#fn910"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>75</SUP></FONT></a> he rolled a stone across the entrance<a name="fnB911" href="mar_note.htm#fn911"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>76</SUP></FONT></a> of the tomb. 
<bqverse 47>47  Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where the body<a name="fnB912" href="mar_note.htm#fn912"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>77</SUP></FONT></a> was placed.

<p><i>The Resurrection </i>
<p><A NAME="16"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought aromatic spices<a name="fnB913" href="mar_note.htm#fn913"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> so that they might go and anoint him.
<bqverse 2>2  And very early on the first day of the week, at sunrise, they went to the tomb. 
<bqverse 3>3  They had been asking each other, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?" 
<bqverse 4>4  But<a name="fnB914" href="mar_note.htm#fn914"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled back. 
<bqverse 5>5  Then<a name="fnB915" href="mar_note.htm#fn915"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> as they went into the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe<a name="fnB916" href="mar_note.htm#fn916"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed. 
<bqverse 6>6  But he said to them, "Do not be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified.<a name="fnB917" href="mar_note.htm#fn917"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> He has been raised!<a name="fnB918" href="mar_note.htm#fn918"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> He is not here. Look, there is the place where they laid him. 
<bqverse 7>7  But go, tell his disciples, even Peter, that he is going ahead of you into Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you." 
<bqverse 8>8  Then<a name="fnB919" href="mar_note.htm#fn919"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> they went out and ran from the tomb, for terror and bewilderment had seized them.<a name="fnB920" href="mar_note.htm#fn920"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> And they said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.<a name="_Toc403221510"></a><a name="_Toc416893997"></a><a name="_Toc432264855"></a><a name="_Toc485059795"></a><a name="_Toc494013292"></a></p>

<bqverse 9>9 Early on the first day of the week, after he arose, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had driven out seven demons. 
<bqverse 10>10  She went out and told those who were with him, while they were mourning and weeping. 
<bqverse 11>11  And when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe.<p>

<bqverse 12>12  After this he appeared in a different form to two of them while they were on their way to the country. 
<bqverse 13>13  They went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them. 
<bqverse 14>14  Then he appeared to the eleven themselves, while they were eating, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him resurrected. 
<bqverse 15>15  He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. 
<bqverse 16>16  The one who believes and is baptized will be saved, but the one who does not believe will be condemned. 
<bqverse 17>17 These signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new languages;<a name="fnB922" href="mar_note.htm#fn922"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 19>19  After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. 
<bqverse 20>20  They went out and proclaimed everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word through the accompanying signs.]]<a name="fnB924" href="mar_note.htm#fn924"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a></p>
