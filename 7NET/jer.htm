<a name="_Toc494012685"></a><p><i>The Superscription</i>
<p><A NAME="1"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b>The following is a record of what Jeremiah son of Hilkiah prophesied and did.<a name="fnB0" href="jer_note.htm#fn0"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a><sup> </sup>He was one of the priests who lived at Anathoth in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. 
<bqverse 2>2 The LORD<a name="fnB1" href="jer_note.htm#fn1"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> began to speak to him<a name="fnB2" href="jer_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> in the thirteenth year that Josiah son of Amon ruled over Judah. 
<bqverse 3>3 The LORD also spoke to him during the time Jehoiakim son of Josiah ruled over Judah, and he continued to speak to him until the fifth month of the eleventh year<a name="fnB3" href="jer_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> that Zedekiah son of Josiah ruled over Judah. That was when the people of Jerusalem were taken into exile.<a name="fnB4" href="jer_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494012686"></a></p>
<p><i>Jeremiah's Call and Commission</i>
<p>
<bqverse 4>4 The LORD said to me, </p>
<br>
<bqverse 5>5  "Before I formed you in your mother's womb<a name="fnB5" href="jer_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> I chose you.<a name="fnB6" href="jer_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a><br>
Before you were born I set you apart.<br>
I appointed you to be a prophet to the nations."</ul><p>
<bqverse 6>6 I answered, "Oh, Lord GOD,<a name="fnB7" href="jer_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> I really<a name="fnB8" href="jer_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> do not know how to speak well enough for that,<a name="fnB9" href="jer_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> for I am too young."<a name="fnB10" href="jer_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  The LORD said to me, "Do not say, `I am too young.' But go<a name="fnB11" href="jer_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> to whomever I send you and say whatever I tell you. 
<bqverse 8>8  Do not be afraid of those to whom I send you,<a name="fnB12" href="jer_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> for I will be with you to rescue you," says the LORD. 
<bqverse 9>9  Then the LORD reached out his hand and touched my mouth and said to me, "I will most assuredly give you the words you are to speak for me.<a name="fnB13" href="jer_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  Know for certain that<a name="fnB14" href="jer_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> I hereby give you the authority to announce to nations and kingdoms that they will be<a name="fnB15" href="jer_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> uprooted and torn down, destroyed and demolished, rebuilt and firmly planted."<a name="fnB16" href="jer_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494012687"></a></p>
<p><i>Visions Confirming Jeremiah's Call and Commission</i>
<p>
<bqverse 11>11 Later the LORD spoke to me and asked me, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" I answered, "I see a branch of an almond tree." 
<bqverse 12>12  Then the LORD said to me, "You have observed correctly. This means<a name="fnB17" href="jer_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> I am watching to make sure my threats are carried out."<a name="fnB18" href="jer_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 13>13  The LORD spoke to me again and asked me, "What do you see?" I answered, "I see a pot of boiling water, and it is tipped toward us from the north."<a name="fnB19" href="jer_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  Then the LORD said to me, "This means<a name="fnB20" href="jer_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> destruction will break out from the north on all who live in the land. 
<bqverse 15>15  For I will soon call for all the peoples of the kingdoms of the north to come," says the LORD. "They will come and their kings will set up their thrones<a name="fnB21" href="jer_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> near the entrances of the gates of Jerusalem. They will attack all the walls surrounding it. They will also attack all the towns in Judah.<a name="fnB22" href="jer_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  In this way<a name="fnB23" href="jer_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> I will pass sentence<a name="fnB24" href="jer_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> on the people of Jerusalem and Judah<a name="fnB25" href="jer_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> because of all their wickedness. For they left me and offered sacrifices to other gods and worshiped what they made with their own hands."<a name="fnB26" href="jer_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 17>17  "But you, Jeremiah,<a name="fnB27" href="jer_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> get ready.<a name="fnB28" href="jer_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> Go and tell these people everything I instruct you to say. Do not be terrified of them, or I will give you good reason to be terrified in front of them.<a name="fnB29" href="jer_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  I, the LORD,<a name="fnB30" href="jer_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> hereby promise to make you<a name="fnB31" href="jer_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> as strong as a fortified city, an iron pillar, and a bronze wall. That way you will be able to stand up against all who live in<a name="fnB32" href="jer_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> the whole land, including the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the rest of the people of the land. 
<bqverse 19>19  They will attack you but they will not be able to overcome you, for I will be with you to rescue you," says the LORD.

<p><i>The LORD Recalls Israel's Earlier Faithfulness</i>
<p><A NAME="2"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> The LORD spoke to me. He said: 
<bqverse 2>2  "Go and declare in the hearing of the people of Jerusalem: `This is what the LORD says: "I remember for your sake<a name="fnB33" href="jer_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> how devoted you were to me in your early years.<a name="fnB34" href="jer_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> I remember how you loved me like a new bride and followed me through the wilderness, through a land that had never been planted. 
<bqverse 3>3 Israel was set apart to the LORD; they were like the first fruits of a harvest to him.<a name="fnB35" href="jer_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> All who tried to devour them were punished; disaster came upon them," says the LORD.'"<a name="_Toc494012689"></a></p>
<p><i>The LORD Reminds Them of the Unfaithfulness of Their Ancestors</i>
<br>
<bqverse 4>4  Now listen to what the Lord has to say, you descendants of Jacob,<br>
all you family groups from the nation of Israel.<br>

<bqverse 5>5  This is what the Lord says:<br>
"What possible fault could your ancestors<a name="fnB36" href="jer_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> have found in me<br>
that they strayed so far from me?<a name="fnB37" href="jer_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a><br>
They paid allegiance to<a name="fnB38" href="jer_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> worthless idols, and so became worthless to me.<a name="fnB39" href="jer_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 6>6 They did not ask:<br>
`Where is the LORD who delivered us out of Egypt,<br>
who brought us through the wilderness,<br>
through a land of desert sands and rift valleys,<br>
through a land of drought and deep darkness,<a name="fnB40" href="jer_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a><br>
through a land in which no one travels,<br>
and where no one lives?'<a name="fnB41" href="jer_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 7>7  I brought you<a name="fnB42" href="jer_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> into a fertile land<br>
so you could enjoy<a name="fnB43" href="jer_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> its fruits and its rich bounty.<br>
But when you entered my land, you defiled it;<a name="fnB44" href="jer_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a><br>
you made the land I call my own<a name="fnB45" href="jer_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> loathsome to me.<br>

<bqverse 8>8 Your priests did not ask, `Where is the LORD?'<a name="fnB46" href="jer_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a><br>
Those responsible for teaching my law<a name="fnB47" href="jer_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> did not really know me.<a name="fnB48" href="jer_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a><br>
Your rulers rebelled against me.<br>
Your prophets prophesied in the name of the god Baal.<a name="fnB49" href="jer_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a><br>
All your leaders worshiped idols that could not help them.<a name="fnB50" href="jer_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494012690"></a></ul><p><i>The LORD Charges Contemporary Israel with Spiritual Adultery</i>
<br>
<bqverse 9>9  "So, once more I will state my case<a name="fnB51" href="jer_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> against you," says the LORD.<br>
"I will also state it against your children and grandchildren.<a name="fnB52" href="jer_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 10>10 For<a name="fnB53" href="jer_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> go west across the sea to the coasts of Cyprus<a name="fnB54" href="jer_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> and see.<br>
Send someone east to Kedar<a name="fnB55" href="jer_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> and have them look carefully.<br>
See if such a thing as this has ever happened:<br>

<bqverse 11>11 Has a nation ever changed its gods,<br>
even though they are not really gods at all?<br>
But my people have exchanged me, their glorious God,<a name="fnB56" href="jer_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a><br>
for a god that cannot help them at all!<a name="fnB57" href="jer_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 12>12 Be amazed at this, O heavens!<a name="fnB58" href="jer_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a><br>
Be shocked and utterly dumbfounded,"<br>
says the LORD.<br>

<bqverse 13>13  "Do so because my people have committed a double wrong:<br>
they have left me,<br>
the fountain of life-giving water,<a name="fnB59" href="jer_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a><br>

cracked cisterns which cannot even hold water."<a name="_Toc494012691"></a></ul><p><i>Israel's Reliance on Foreign Alliances (not on God)</i>

<bqverse 14>14 "Israel is not a slave, is he?<br>
He was not born into slavery, was he?<a name="fnB60" href="jer_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a><br>
If not, why then has he become something to be carried off?<br>

<bqverse 15>15 Like lions his enemies roar victoriously over him;<br>
they raise their voices in triumph.<a name="fnB61" href="jer_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a><br>

his cities have been burned down and abandoned.<a name="fnB62" href="jer_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 16>16 Moreover, the soldiers from Memphis and Tahpanhes<br>
have cracked your skulls, people of Israel.<a name="fnB63" href="jer_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 17>17  You have brought all this on yourself, Israel.<a name="fnB64" href="jer_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a><br>
You brought it about by leaving the LORD your God,<br>
even while he was leading you along the way.<a name="fnB65" href="jer_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a><br>

Know, then, and realize how utterly harmful<a name="fnB72" href="jer_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a><br>
it was for you to leave me, the LORD your God,<a name="fnB73" href="jer_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<br>
<bqverse 20>20 "Indeed,<a name="fnB76" href="jer_note.htm#fn76"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> long ago you threw off my authority<br>
and refused to be subject to me.<a name="fnB77" href="jer_note.htm#fn77"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a><br>
You said, `I will not serve you.'<a name="fnB78" href="jer_note.htm#fn78"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a><br>
Instead, you gave yourself to other gods on every high hill<br>
and under every green tree,<br>
like a prostitute sprawls down before her lovers.<a name="fnB79" href="jer_note.htm#fn79"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 21>21 I planted you in the land <br>
like a special vine of the very best stock.<br>
Why in the world have you turned into something like a wild vine<br>
that produces rotten, foul-smelling grapes?<a name="fnB80" href="jer_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 22>22  You can try to wash away your guilt with a strong detergent.<br>
You can use as much soap as you want.<br>
But the stain of your guilt is still there for me to see,"<a name="fnB81" href="jer_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a><br>
says the Lord GOD.<a name="fnB82" href="jer_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 23>23 "How can you say, `I have not made myself unclean.<br>
I have not paid allegiance to<a name="fnB83" href="jer_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> the gods called Baal.'<br>
Just look at the way you have behaved in the Valley of Hinnom!<a name="fnB84" href="jer_note.htm#fn84"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a><br>
Think about the things you have done there!<br>
You are like a flighty, young female camel<br>
that rushes here and there, criss-crossing its path.<a name="fnB85" href="jer_note.htm#fn85"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 24>24 You are like a wild female donkey brought up in the wilderness.<br>
In her lust she sniffs the wind to get the scent of a male.<a name="fnB86" href="jer_note.htm#fn86"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a><br>
No one can hold her back when she is in heat.<br>
None of the males need wear themselves out chasing after her.<br>
At mating time she is easy to find.<a name="fnB87" href="jer_note.htm#fn87"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 25>25 Israel, do not chase after other gods until your shoes wear out<br>
and your throats become dry.<a name="fnB88" href="jer_note.htm#fn88"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a><br>
But you say, `It is useless for you to try and stop me!<br>
You cannot, because I love those foreign gods.<a name="fnB89" href="jer_note.htm#fn89"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a><br>
I want to chase after them.'<br>

<bqverse 26>26  A thief has to suffer dishonor when he is caught.<br>
So also the people of Israel will suffer dishonor for what they have done.<a name="fnB90" href="jer_note.htm#fn90"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a><br>
And so will their kings and officials,<br>
their priests and their prophets.<br>

<bqverse 27>27 They say to a piece of wood, `You are my father.'<br>
They say to a piece of stone, `You gave me birth.'<a name="fnB91" href="jer_note.htm#fn91"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a><br>
Yes, they have turned away from me<br>
instead of turning to me.<a name="fnB92" href="jer_note.htm#fn92"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a><br>
Yet when they are in trouble they say,<br>
`Come and save us!'<br>

<bqverse 28>28  But where are the gods you made for yourselves?<br>
Let them come and save you, if they really can,<br>
when you are in trouble.<br>
The sad fact is that<a name="fnB93" href="jer_note.htm#fn93"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> you have as many gods<br>
as you have towns, Judah.<br>

<bqverse 29>29  "Why do you try to refute me?<a name="fnB94" href="jer_note.htm#fn94"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a><br>
All of you have rebelled against me,"<br>
says the LORD.<br>

<bqverse 30>30  "It did no good for me to punish your people.<br>
They did not respond to such correction.<br>
You slaughtered your prophets<br>
just like a voracious lion would."<a name="fnB95" href="jer_note.htm#fn95"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 31>31  You people of this generation,<br>
listen to what the LORD says.<br>
"Have I been like a wilderness to you, Israel?<br>
Have I been like a dark and dangerous land to you?<a name="fnB96" href="jer_note.htm#fn96"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a><br>
Why then do you<a name="fnB97" href="jer_note.htm#fn97"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> say, `We are free to wander.<a name="fnB98" href="jer_note.htm#fn98"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a><br>
We will not come to you any more?'<br>

<bqverse 32>32  Does a young woman forget to put on her jewels?<br>
Does a bride forget to put on her bridal attire?<br>
But my people have forgotten me <br>
for more days than can even be counted.<br>

<bqverse 33>33  "My, how good you have become<br>
at chasing after your lovers!<a name="fnB99" href="jer_note.htm#fn99"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a><br>

could learn from the things you have done!<a name="fnB100" href="jer_note.htm#fn100"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 34>34 Moreover, your clothes are stained with<br>
the lifeblood of the poor, <br>
who were not guilty of doing anything wrong.<br>
You did not, for example, catch them breaking into your homes.<a name="fnB101" href="jer_note.htm#fn101"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>69</SUP></FONT></a><br>
Yet, in spite of all these things you have done,<a name="fnB102" href="jer_note.htm#fn102"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>70</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 35>35 you say, `I have not done anything wrong;<br>
so the LORD cannot really be angry with me any more.'<br>
But, watch out!<a name="fnB103" href="jer_note.htm#fn103"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>71</SUP></FONT></a> I will bring down judgment on you<br>

I looked up at the heavens<br>

<bqverse 24>24 I looked at the mountains and I saw that they were shaking.<br>
All the hills were swaying back and forth.<br>

<bqverse 25>25 I looked and saw that there were no people,<a name="fnB227" href="jer_note.htm#fn227"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a><br>

Some of them go into the thickets.<br>
Others climb up among the rocks.<br>
All the cities are deserted.<br>
No one remains in them.<br>

<bqverse 31>31 In fact,<a name="fnB237" href="jer_note.htm#fn237"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>73</SUP></FONT></a> I hear a cry like that of a woman in labor,<br>
a cry of anguish like that of a woman giving birth to her first baby.<br>
It is the cry of fair Zion<a name="fnB238" href="jer_note.htm#fn238"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>74</SUP></FONT></a> gasping for breath,<br>
reaching out for help,<a name="fnB239" href="jer_note.htm#fn239"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>75</SUP></FONT></a> saying,<br>

Their ears are so closed<a name="fnB342" href="jer_note.htm#fn342"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<br>
<bqverse 13>13  "That is because, from the least important to the most important of them,<br>

Ask where the path is that leads to blessing<a name="fnB356" href="jer_note.htm#fn356"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> and follow it.<br>
If you do, you will find rest for your souls."<br>
But they said, "We will not follow it."</ul><p>
<bqverse 17>17  The LORD said,<a name="fnB357" href="jer_note.htm#fn357"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> </p>
<br>"I appointed prophets as watchmen to warn you,<a name="fnB358" href="jer_note.htm#fn358"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> saying:<br>
`Pay attention to the warning sound of the trumpet!'"<a name="fnB359" href="jer_note.htm#fn359"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a><br>
But they said, "We will not pay attention."</ul><p>
<bqverse 18>18  So the LORD said,<a name="fnB360" href="jer_note.htm#fn360"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> </p>
<br>"Hear, you nations!<br>
Be witnesses and take note of what will happen to these people.<a name="fnB361" href="jer_note.htm#fn361"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 19>19  Hear this, you peoples of the earth:<a name="fnB362" href="jer_note.htm#fn362"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a><br>
`Take note!<a name="fnB363" href="jer_note.htm#fn363"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> I am about to bring disaster on these people.<br>
It will come as a payment for their scheming.<a name="fnB364" href="jer_note.htm#fn364"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a><br>
For they have not paid any heed to what I have said<a name="fnB365" href="jer_note.htm#fn365"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a><br>
and have rejected my law.<br>

<bqverse 20>20  It does me no good<a name="fnB366" href="jer_note.htm#fn366"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> for them to bring me<a name="fnB367" href="jer_note.htm#fn367"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> the frankincense that comes from Sheba <br>

I get no pleasure from the sacrifices they offer to me.'<a name="fnB368" href="jer_note.htm#fn368"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 21>21 So, this is what the LORD says:<br>
`I will assuredly<a name="fnB369" href="jer_note.htm#fn369"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> bring an army against<a name="fnB370" href="jer_note.htm#fn370"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> these people.<br>
Parents and children will stumble and fall to their destruction.<a name="fnB371" href="jer_note.htm#fn371"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a><br>
Friends and neighbors will die.'<br>

<bqverse 22>22  "This is what the LORD says:<br>
`Beware! An army is coming from a land in the north.<br>
A mighty nation is stirring into action in faraway parts of the earth.<br>

<bqverse 27>27  The LORD said to me,<a name="fnB381" href="jer_note.htm#fn381"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> </p>
<br>"I appoint you to be like a tester of metal.<br>

<bqverse 28>28  And I reported,<a name="fnB384" href="jer_note.htm#fn384"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>70</SUP></FONT></a> </p>
<br>"All of them are the most stubborn of rebels.<a name="fnB385" href="jer_note.htm#fn385"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>71</SUP></FONT></a><br>
They are as hard as bronze or iron.<br>
They go about telling lies.<br>
They all deal corruptly.<br>

<bqverse 29>29  The fires of judgment have burned fiercely.<br>
But there is too much dross to be removed.<a name="fnB386" href="jer_note.htm#fn386"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>72</SUP></FONT></a><br>
The process of refining them has proved useless.<a name="fnB387" href="jer_note.htm#fn387"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>73</SUP></FONT></a><br>
The wicked have not been removed.<br>

<bqverse 30>30  They are to be evaluated like `reject silver.'<a name="fnB388" href="jer_note.htm#fn388"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>74</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 18>18  The children are gathering firewood. The fathers are building fires with it.

<bqverse 21>21  The LORD also said to the people of Judah,<a name="fnB431" href="jer_note.htm#fn431"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> "The LORD God of Israel who rules over all<a name="fnB432" href="jer_note.htm#fn432"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> says: `You might as well go ahead and add the meat of your burnt offerings to that of the other sacrifices and eat it, too!<a name="fnB433" href="jer_note.htm#fn433"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 24>24  But they did not listen to me or pay any attention to me. They followed the stubborn inclinations of their own wicked hearts. They got worse and worse instead of getting better.<a name="fnB438" href="jer_note.htm#fn438"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 13>13  The LORD answered, "This has happened because these people have rejected my laws which I gave them. They have not obeyed me or followed those laws.<a name="fnB551" href="jer_note.htm#fn551"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  Instead they have followed the stubborn inclinations of their own hearts.

<bqverse 11>11  So, I, the LORD, say this:<a name="fnB663" href="jer_note.htm#fn663"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> `I will soon bring disaster on them which they will not be able to escape! And when they cry out to me for help, I will not listen to them. 
<bqverse 12>12  Then those living in the towns of Judah and in Jerusalem will<a name="fnB664" href="jer_note.htm#fn664"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> go and cry out for help to the gods to whom they have been sacrificing. However, those gods will by no means<a name="fnB665" href="jer_note.htm#fn665"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> be able to save them when disaster strikes them. 
<bqverse 13>13  This is in spite of the fact that<a name="fnB666" href="jer_note.htm#fn666"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> the people of Judah have as many gods as they have towns<a name="fnB667" href="jer_note.htm#fn667"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> and the citizens of Jerusalem have set up as many altars to sacrifice to that disgusting god, Baal, as they have streets in the city.'<a name="fnB668" href="jer_note.htm#fn668"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  So, Jeremiah, do not pray for these people. Do not cry out to me or petition me on their behalf. Do not plead with me to save them.<a name="fnB669" href="jer_note.htm#fn669"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> For I will not listen to them when they call out to me for help when disaster strikes them."<a name="fnB670" href="jer_note.htm#fn670"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 15>15  The LORD says to<a name="fnB671" href="jer_note.htm#fn671"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> the people of Judah,</p>
<br>"What right do you have to be in my temple, my beloved people?<a name="fnB672" href="jer_note.htm#fn672"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a><br>
Many of you have done wicked things.<a name="fnB673" href="jer_note.htm#fn673"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a><br>
Can your acts of treachery be so easily canceled by sacred offerings<a name="fnB674" href="jer_note.htm#fn674"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a><br>
that you take joy in doing evil even while you make them?<a name="fnB675" href="jer_note.htm#fn675"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 16>16  I, the LORD, once called<a name="fnB676" href="jer_note.htm#fn676"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> you a thriving olive tree,<br>
one that produced beautiful fruit.<br>
But I will set you<a name="fnB677" href="jer_note.htm#fn677"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> on fire<br>

Then all your branches will be good for nothing.<a name="fnB679" href="jer_note.htm#fn679"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 17>17  For though I, the LORD who rules over all,<a name="fnB680" href="jer_note.htm#fn680"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> planted you in the land,<a name="fnB681" href="jer_note.htm#fn681"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a><br>
I now decree that disaster will come on you.<a name="fnB682" href="jer_note.htm#fn682"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a><br>
That is because the nations of Israel and Judah have done evil<br>
and have made me angry by offering sacrifices to the god Baal."<a name="fnB683" href="jer_note.htm#fn683"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494012705"></a></ul><p><i>A Plot Against Jeremiah is Revealed and He Complains of Injustice</i>
<br>
<bqverse 18>18  The LORD gave me knowledge, that I might have understanding.<a name="fnB684" href="jer_note.htm#fn684"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 19>19  Before this I had been like a docile lamb ready to be led to the slaughter.

<bqverse 20>20 So I said to the LORD,<a name="fnB691" href="jer_note.htm#fn691"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 21>21  Then the LORD spoke to me about<a name="fnB695" href="jer_note.htm#fn695"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> some men from Anathoth<a name="fnB696" href="jer_note.htm#fn696"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> who were threatening to kill me.

<bqverse 1>1 </b> The LORD said to Jeremiah:<a name="fnB1019" href="jer_note.htm#fn1019"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  "Go down at once<a name="fnB1020" href="jer_note.htm#fn1020"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> to the potter's house. I will speak to you further there."<a name="fnB1021" href="jer_note.htm#fn1021"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  So I went down to the potter's house and found him working<a name="fnB1022" href="jer_note.htm#fn1022"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> at his wheel.<a name="fnB1023" href="jer_note.htm#fn1023"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  Now and then<a name="fnB1024" href="jer_note.htm#fn1024"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> there would be something wrong<a name="fnB1025" href="jer_note.htm#fn1025"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> with the pot he was molding from the clay<a name="fnB1026" href="jer_note.htm#fn1026"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> with his hands. Then he would rework<a name="fnB1027" href="jer_note.htm#fn1027"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> the clay into another pot as he saw fit.<a name="fnB1028" href="jer_note.htm#fn1028"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 5>5 Then the LORD said to me,<a name="fnB1029" href="jer_note.htm#fn1029"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  "I, the LORD, say,<a name="fnB1030" href="jer_note.htm#fn1030"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> `O nation of Israel, can I not deal with you as this potter deals with the clay?<a name="fnB1031" href="jer_note.htm#fn1031"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> In my hands, you, O nation of Israel, are just like the clay in this potter's hand.' 
<bqverse 7>7  There are times, Jeremiah,<a name="fnB1032" href="jer_note.htm#fn1032"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> when I threaten to uproot, tear down, and destroy a nation or a kingdom.<a name="fnB1033" href="jer_note.htm#fn1033"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8 But if that nation that I threatened stops doing wrong,<a name="fnB1034" href="jer_note.htm#fn1034"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> I will forgo the destruction<a name="fnB1035" href="jer_note.htm#fn1035"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> I intended to do to it. 
<bqverse 9>9 And there are times when I promise to build up and establish<a name="fnB1036" href="jer_note.htm#fn1036"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> a nation or a kingdom. 
<bqverse 10>10 But if that nation does what displeases me and does not obey me, then I will forgo the good I promised to do to it. 
<bqverse 11>11  So now, tell the people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem this: The LORD says, `I am preparing to bring disaster on you. I am making plans to punish you.<a name="fnB1037" href="jer_note.htm#fn1037"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> So, every one of you, stop the evil things you have been doing.<a name="fnB1038" href="jer_note.htm#fn1038"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> Correct the way you have been living and do what is right.'<a name="fnB1039" href="jer_note.htm#fn1039"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  But they just keep saying, `It is useless for you to try to stop us.<a name="fnB1040" href="jer_note.htm#fn1040"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> For we will continue to follow our own ways.

<bqverse 13>13  Therefore, the LORD says,</p>
<br>"Ask the people of other nations<br>
whether they have heard of anything like this.<br>
Israel should have been like a virgin.<br>
But she has done something utterly revolting!<br>

<bqverse 14>14  Does the snow ever completely vanish from the rocky slopes of Lebanon?<br>

<bqverse 15>15  Yet my people have forgotten me<br>

This makes them stumble along in the way they live<br>
and to leave the old reliable path of their fathers.<a name="fnB1043" href="jer_note.htm#fn1043"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 16>16  So their land will become an object of horror.<a name="fnB1045" href="jer_note.htm#fn1045"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a><br>
People will forever hiss out their scorn over it.<br>
All who pass that way will be filled with horror<br>
and will shake their heads in derision.<a name="fnB1046" href="jer_note.htm#fn1046"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 17>17  I will scatter them before their enemies<br>

I will turn my back on them and not look favorably on them<a name="fnB1047" href="jer_note.htm#fn1047"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 16>16  May that man be like the cities<a name="fnB1127" href="jer_note.htm#fn1127"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a><br>
that the LORD destroyed without showing any mercy.<br>
May he hear a cry of distress in the morning<br>
and a battle cry at noon.<br>

<bqverse 17>17  For he did not kill me before I came from the womb,<br>
making my mother's womb my grave<br>
and leaving her pregnant with me forever.<a name="fnB1128" href="jer_note.htm#fn1128"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 18>18  Why did I ever come forth from my mother's womb?<br>

They live wicked lives and they misuse their power.<a name="fnB1246" href="jer_note.htm#fn1246"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a><br>
So the land is dried up<a name="fnB1247" href="jer_note.htm#fn1247"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> because it is under his curse.<a name="fnB1248" href="jer_note.htm#fn1248"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 11>11  Moreover,<a name="fnB1249" href="jer_note.htm#fn1249"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD says,<a name="fnB1250" href="jer_note.htm#fn1250"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a><br>
"Both the prophets and priests are godless.<br>

<bqverse 12>12  So the paths they follow will be dark and slippery.<br>
They will stumble and fall headlong.<br>

`Nothing bad will happen to you.'<br>

they would have proclaimed my message to my people.<br>

<bqverse 34>34  And I will punish any prophet, priest, or other person who says "The LORD's message is burdensome."<a name="fnB1311" href="jer_note.htm#fn1311"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>97</SUP></FONT></a> I will punish both that person and his whole family.'"<a name="fnB1312" href="jer_note.htm#fn1312"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>98</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 35>35  So I, Jeremiah, tell you,<a name="fnB1313" href="jer_note.htm#fn1313"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>99</SUP></FONT></a> "Each of you people should rather say to his friend or his relative, `How did the LORD answer? Or what did the LORD say?'<a name="fnB1314" href="jer_note.htm#fn1314"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>100</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 36>36  You must no longer say that the LORD's message is burdensome.<a name="fnB1315" href="jer_note.htm#fn1315"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>101</SUP></FONT></a> For what is `burdensome'<a name="fnB1316" href="jer_note.htm#fn1316"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>102</SUP></FONT></a> really pertains to what a person himself says.<a name="fnB1317" href="jer_note.htm#fn1317"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>103</SUP></FONT></a> Thus, you are misrepresenting<a name="fnB1318" href="jer_note.htm#fn1318"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>104</SUP></FONT></a> the words of our God, the living God, the LORD who rules over all.<a name="fnB1319" href="jer_note.htm#fn1319"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>105</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 37>37  Each of you should merely ask the prophet, `What answer did the LORD give you? Or what did the LORD say?'<a name="fnB1320" href="jer_note.htm#fn1320"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>106</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 38>38  But just suppose you keep on saying, `The message of the LORD is burdensome.' Here is what the LORD says will happen: `I sent word to you that you must not say, "The LORD's message is burdensome." But you used the words "The LORD's message is burdensome" anyway. 
<bqverse 39>39 So<a name="fnB1321" href="jer_note.htm#fn1321"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>107</SUP></FONT></a> I will carry you far off<a name="fnB1322" href="jer_note.htm#fn1322"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>108</SUP></FONT></a> and throw you away.

<bqverse 40>40  I will bring on you lasting shame and lasting disgrace which will never be forgotten!'"

<p><i>Seventy Years of Servitude for Failure to Give Heed</i>
<p><A NAME="25"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> In the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah, the LORD spoke to Jeremiah<a name="fnB1338" href="jer_note.htm#fn1338"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> concerning all the people of Judah.

<bqverse 2>2  So the prophet Jeremiah spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the people who were living in Jerusalem. He said, 
<bqverse 3>3  "For the last twenty-three years, from the thirteenth year that Josiah son of Amon was ruling in Judah<a name="fnB1340" href="jer_note.htm#fn1340"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> until now, the LORD has been speaking to me. I told you over and over again<a name="fnB1341" href="jer_note.htm#fn1341"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> what he said.<a name="fnB1342" href="jer_note.htm#fn1342"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> But you would not listen. 
<bqverse 4>4  Over and over again<a name="fnB1343" href="jer_note.htm#fn1343"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD has sent<a name="fnB1344" href="jer_note.htm#fn1344"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> his servants the prophets to you.

<bqverse 5>5  He said through them,<a name="fnB1346" href="jer_note.htm#fn1346"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> `Each of you must turn from your wicked ways and stop doing the evil things you are doing.<a name="fnB1347" href="jer_note.htm#fn1347"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> If you do, I will let you continue to live here in the land that I gave to you and your ancestors as a lasting possession.<a name="fnB1348" href="jer_note.htm#fn1348"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 7>7  So, now the LORD says,<a name="fnB1351" href="jer_note.htm#fn1351"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> `You have not listened to me. But<a name="fnB1352" href="jer_note.htm#fn1352"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> you have made me angry by the things that you have done.<a name="fnB1353" href="jer_note.htm#fn1353"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> Thus you have brought harm on yourselves.'<p>

<bqverse 8>8  "Therefore, the LORD who rules over all<a name="fnB1354" href="jer_note.htm#fn1354"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> says, `You have not listened to what I said.<a name="fnB1355" href="jer_note.htm#fn1355"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 12>12  "`But when the seventy years are over, I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation<a name="fnB1367" href="jer_note.htm#fn1367"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> for their sins.

The LORD so affirms it.<a name="fnB1422" href="jer_note.htm#fn1422"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>85</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 32>32  The LORD who rules over all<a name="fnB1423" href="jer_note.htm#fn1423"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>86</SUP></FONT></a> says,<br>
`Disaster will soon come on one nation after another.<a name="fnB1424" href="jer_note.htm#fn1424"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>87</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 33>33  Those who have been killed by the LORD at that time will be scattered from one end of the earth to the other.

The shepherds of the flocks will not be able to escape.<br>

<bqverse 36>36 Listen to the cries of anguish of the leaders.<br>
Listen to the wails of the shepherds of the flocks.<br>
They are wailing because the LORD<br>
is about to destroy their lands.<a name="fnB1430" href="jer_note.htm#fn1430"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>93</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 37>37  Their peaceful dwelling places will be laid waste<a name="fnB1431" href="jer_note.htm#fn1431"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>94</SUP></FONT></a><br>
by the fierce anger of the LORD.<a name="fnB1432" href="jer_note.htm#fn1432"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>95</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 38>38  The LORD is like a lion who has left his lair.<a name="fnB1433" href="jer_note.htm#fn1433"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>96</SUP></FONT></a><br>
So their lands will certainly<a name="fnB1434" href="jer_note.htm#fn1434"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>97</SUP></FONT></a> be laid waste<br>
by the warfare of the oppressive nation<a name="fnB1435" href="jer_note.htm#fn1435"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>98</SUP></FONT></a><br>
and by the fierce anger of the LORD."

<bqverse 1>1 </b> The LORD spoke to Jeremiah<a name="fnB1437" href="jer_note.htm#fn1437"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> at the beginning of the reign<a name="fnB1438" href="jer_note.htm#fn1438"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> of Josiah's son, King Jehoiakim of Judah. 
<bqverse 2>2  The LORD said, "Go and stand in the courtyard of the LORD's temple.<a name="fnB1439" href="jer_note.htm#fn1439"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> Speak out to all the people who are coming from the towns of Judah to worship in the LORD's temple. Tell them everything I command you to tell them. Don't leave out a single word! 
<bqverse 3>3  Maybe they will pay heed and each of them will stop living the evil way they do.<a name="fnB1440" href="jer_note.htm#fn1440"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> If they do that, then I will forgo destroying them<a name="fnB1441" href="jer_note.htm#fn1441"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> as I had intended to do because of the wicked things they have been doing.<a name="fnB1442" href="jer_note.htm#fn1442"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  Tell them that the LORD says,<a name="fnB1443" href="jer_note.htm#fn1443"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> `You must obey me! You must live according to the way I have instructed you in my laws.<a name="fnB1444" href="jer_note.htm#fn1444"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  You must pay heed to the exhortations of my servants the prophets. I have sent them to you over and over again.<a name="fnB1445" href="jer_note.htm#fn1445"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> But you have not paid any heed to them. 
<bqverse 6>6  If you do not obey me,<a name="fnB1446" href="jer_note.htm#fn1446"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> then I will do to this temple what I did to Shiloh.<a name="fnB1447" href="jer_note.htm#fn1447"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> And I will make this city an example to be used in curses by people from all the nations on the earth.'"<p>

<bqverse 7>7 The priests, the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah say these things in the LORD's temple. 
<bqverse 8>8  Jeremiah had just barely finished saying all the LORD had commanded him to say to all the people. All at once some<a name="fnB1448" href="jer_note.htm#fn1448"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> of the priests, the prophets, and the people grabbed him and shouted, "You deserve to die!<a name="fnB1449" href="jer_note.htm#fn1449"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  How dare you claim the LORD's authority to prophesy such things! How dare you claim his authority to prophesy that this temple will become like Shiloh and that this city will become an uninhabited ruin!"<a name="fnB1450" href="jer_note.htm#fn1450"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> Then all the people crowded around Jeremiah.<p>

<bqverse 10>10  However, some of the officials<a name="fnB1451" href="jer_note.htm#fn1451"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> of Judah heard about what was happening<a name="fnB1452" href="jer_note.htm#fn1452"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> and they rushed up to the LORD's temple from the royal palace. They set up court<a name="fnB1453" href="jer_note.htm#fn1453"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> at the entrance of the New Gate of the LORD's temple.<a name="fnB1454" href="jer_note.htm#fn1454"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  Then the priests and the prophets made their charges before the officials and all the people. They said,<a name="fnB1455" href="jer_note.htm#fn1455"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> "This man should be condemned to die<a name="fnB1456" href="jer_note.htm#fn1456"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> because he prophesied against this city. You have heard him do so<a name="fnB1457" href="jer_note.htm#fn1457"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> with your own ears."<p>

<bqverse 12>12  Then Jeremiah made his defense before all the officials and all the people. He said,<a name="fnB1458" href="jer_note.htm#fn1458"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> "The LORD sent me to prophesy everything you have heard me say against this temple and against this city.

<bqverse 14>14  As to my case, I am in your power.<a name="fnB1461" href="jer_note.htm#fn1461"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> Do to me what you deem fair and proper. 
<bqverse 15>15  But you should take careful note of this: If you put me to death, you will bring on yourselves and this city and those who live in it the guilt of murdering an innocent man. For the LORD has sent me to speak all this where you can hear it. That is the truth!"<a name="fnB1462" href="jer_note.htm#fn1462"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 16>16  Then the officials and all the people rendered their verdict to the priests and the prophets. They said,<a name="fnB1463" href="jer_note.htm#fn1463"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> "This man should not be condemned to die.<a name="fnB1464" href="jer_note.htm#fn1464"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> For he has spoken to us under the authority of the LORD our God."<a name="fnB1465" href="jer_note.htm#fn1465"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  Then some of the elders of Judah<a name="fnB1466" href="jer_note.htm#fn1466"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> stepped forward and spoke to all the people gathered there. They said, 
<bqverse 18>18 "Micah from Moresheth<a name="fnB1467" href="jer_note.htm#fn1467"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> prophesied during the time Hezekiah was king of Judah.<a name="fnB1468" href="jer_note.htm#fn1468"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> He told all the people of Judah,</p>

<bqverse 19>19  King Hezekiah and all the people of Judah didn't put him to death, did they?

But we are on the verge of bringing great disaster on ourselves."<a name="fnB1475" href="jer_note.htm#fn1475"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 20>20  (Now there was another man<a name="fnB1476" href="jer_note.htm#fn1476"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> who prophesied as the LORD's representative<a name="fnB1477" href="jer_note.htm#fn1477"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> against this city and this land just as Jeremiah did. His name was Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath Jearim.<a name="fnB1478" href="jer_note.htm#fn1478"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  When the king and all his bodyguards<a name="fnB1479" href="jer_note.htm#fn1479"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> and officials heard what he was prophesying,<a name="fnB1480" href="jer_note.htm#fn1480"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> the king sought to have him executed. But Uriah found out about it and fled to Egypt out of fear.<a name="fnB1481" href="jer_note.htm#fn1481"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  However, King Jehoiakim sent some men to Egypt, including Elnathan son of Achbor,<a name="fnB1482" href="jer_note.htm#fn1482"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23  and they brought Uriah back from there.<a name="fnB1483" href="jer_note.htm#fn1483"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> They took him to King Jehoiakim, who had him executed and had his body thrown into the burial place of the common people.)<a name="fnB1484" href="jer_note.htm#fn1484"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 24>24  However, Ahikam son of Shaphan<a name="fnB1485" href="jer_note.htm#fn1485"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> used his influence to keep Jeremiah from being handed over and executed by the people.<a name="fnB1486" href="jer_note.htm#fn1486"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Jeremiah Counsels Submission to Babylon </i>
<p><A NAME="27"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> The LORD spoke to Jeremiah<a name="fnB1487" href="jer_note.htm#fn1487"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a><sup> </sup>early in the reign of Josiah's son, King Zedekiah of Judah.<a name="fnB1488" href="jer_note.htm#fn1488"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  The LORD told me,<a name="fnB1489" href="jer_note.htm#fn1489"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> "Make a yoke<a name="fnB1490" href="jer_note.htm#fn1490"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> out of leather straps and wooden crossbars and put it on your neck. 
<bqverse 3>3  Use it to send messages to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon.<a name="fnB1491" href="jer_note.htm#fn1491"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> Send them through<a name="fnB1492" href="jer_note.htm#fn1492"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to King Zedekiah of Judah. 
<bqverse 4>4  Charge them to give their masters a message from me. Tell them, `The LORD God of Israel who rules over all<a name="fnB1493" href="jer_note.htm#fn1493"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> says to give your masters this message. He says,<a name="fnB1494" href="jer_note.htm#fn1494"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5 "I made the earth and the people and animals on it by my mighty power and great strength,<a name="fnB1495" href="jer_note.htm#fn1495"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> and I give it to whomever I see fit.<a name="fnB1496" href="jer_note.htm#fn1496"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  I have at this time placed all these nations of yours under the power<a name="fnB1497" href="jer_note.htm#fn1497"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> of my servant,<a name="fnB1498" href="jer_note.htm#fn1498"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.

<bqverse 7>7  All nations must serve him and his son and grandson<a name="fnB1500" href="jer_note.htm#fn1500"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> until the time comes for his own nation to fall.<a name="fnB1501" href="jer_note.htm#fn1501"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> Then many nations and great kings will in turn subjugate Babylon.<a name="fnB1502" href="jer_note.htm#fn1502"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  But suppose a nation or a kingdom will not be subject to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. Suppose it will not submit to the yoke of servitude to<a name="fnB1503" href="jer_note.htm#fn1503"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> him. I, the LORD, affirm that<a name="fnB1504" href="jer_note.htm#fn1504"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> I will punish that nation. I will use the king of Babylon to punish it<a name="fnB1505" href="jer_note.htm#fn1505"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> with war,<a name="fnB1506" href="jer_note.htm#fn1506"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> starvation, and disease until I have destroyed it.<a name="fnB1507" href="jer_note.htm#fn1507"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  So don't listen to your prophets or to those who claim to predict the future by divination,<a name="fnB1508" href="jer_note.htm#fn1508"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> by dreams, by consulting the dead,<a name="fnB1509" href="jer_note.htm#fn1509"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> or by practicing magic.

<bqverse 10>10  Don't listen to them,<a name="fnB1511" href="jer_note.htm#fn1511"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> because their prophecies are lies.<a name="fnB1512" href="jer_note.htm#fn1512"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> Listening to them will only cause you<a name="fnB1513" href="jer_note.htm#fn1513"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> to be taken far away from your native land. I will drive you out of your country and you will die in exile.<a name="fnB1514" href="jer_note.htm#fn1514"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  Things will go better for the nation that submits to the yoke of servitude to<a name="fnB1515" href="jer_note.htm#fn1515"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> the king of Babylon and is subject to him.

<bqverse 12>12  I told King Zedekiah of Judah the same thing. I said,<a name="fnB1518" href="jer_note.htm#fn1518"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> "Submit<a name="fnB1519" href="jer_note.htm#fn1519"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> to the yoke of servitude to<a name="fnB1520" href="jer_note.htm#fn1520"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> the king of Babylon.

<bqverse 13>13  Why should you and your people die in war<a name="fnB1521" href="jer_note.htm#fn1521"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> or from starvation or disease? That's what the LORD says will happen to any nation<a name="fnB1522" href="jer_note.htm#fn1522"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> that will not be subject to the king of Babylon.

<p><i>Jeremiah Confronted by a False Prophet</i>
<p><A NAME="28"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> The following events occurred in that same year, early in the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah. To be more precise, it was the fifth month of the fourth year of his reign.<a name="fnB1544" href="jer_note.htm#fn1544"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> The prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, who was from Gibeon, spoke to Jeremiah<a name="fnB1545" href="jer_note.htm#fn1545"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> in the LORD's temple in the presence of the priests and all the people.<a name="fnB1546" href="jer_note.htm#fn1546"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> He said,<a name="fnB1547" href="jer_note.htm#fn1547"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2 "The LORD God of Israel who rules over all<a name="fnB1548" href="jer_note.htm#fn1548"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> says, `I will break the yoke of servitude<a name="fnB1549" href="jer_note.htm#fn1549"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> to the king of Babylon. 
<bqverse 3>3  Before two years are over,<sup> </sup>I will bring back to this place everything that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took from it and carried away to Babylon. 
<bqverse 4>4  I will also bring back to this place Jehoiakim's son King Jeconiah of Judah<sup> </sup>and all the exiles who were taken to Babylon.' Indeed, the LORD affirms,<a name="fnB1550" href="jer_note.htm#fn1550"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> `I will break the yoke of servitude to the king of Babylon.'"<p>

<bqverse 5>5  Then the prophet Jeremiah responded to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the LORD's temple. 
<bqverse 6>6  The prophet Jeremiah said, "Amen! May the LORD do all this! May the LORD make your prophecy come true! May he bring back to this place from Babylon all the valuable articles taken from the LORD's temple and the people who were carried into exile. 
<bqverse 7>7  But listen to what I have to say to you and to all these people.<a name="fnB1551" href="jer_note.htm#fn1551"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  From earliest times, the prophets who preceded you and me invariably<a name="fnB1552" href="jer_note.htm#fn1552"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> prophesied war, disaster,<a name="fnB1553" href="jer_note.htm#fn1553"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and plagues against many countries and great kingdoms. 
<bqverse 9>9  So if a prophet prophesied<a name="fnB1554" href="jer_note.htm#fn1554"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> peace and prosperity, it was only known that the LORD truly sent him when what he prophesied came true."<p>

<bqverse 10>10  The prophet Hananiah then took the yoke off the prophet Jeremiah's neck and broke it. 
<bqverse 11>11  Then he spoke up in the presence of all the people. He said, "The LORD says, `In the same way I will break the yoke of servitude of all the nations to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon<a name="fnB1555" href="jer_note.htm#fn1555"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> before two years are over.'" After he heard this, the prophet Jeremiah left and went on his way.<a name="fnB1556" href="jer_note.htm#fn1556"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 12>12  But shortly after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, the LORD spoke to Jeremiah. He said, 
<bqverse 13>13  "Go and tell Hananiah that the LORD says,<a name="fnB1557" href="jer_note.htm#fn1557"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> `You have indeed broken the wooden yoke. But you have<a name="fnB1558" href="jer_note.htm#fn1558"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> only succeeded in replacing it with an iron one!<a name="fnB1559" href="jer_note.htm#fn1559"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  For the LORD God of Israel who rules over all<a name="fnB1560" href="jer_note.htm#fn1560"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> says, "I have put an irresistible yoke of servitude on all these nations<a name="fnB1561" href="jer_note.htm#fn1561"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> so they will serve King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. And they will indeed serve him. I have even given him control over the wild animals."'"<a name="fnB1562" href="jer_note.htm#fn1562"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  Then the prophet Jeremiah told the prophet Hananiah, "Listen, Hananiah! The LORD did not send you! You are giving these people false assurances.<a name="fnB1563" href="jer_note.htm#fn1563"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  So the LORD says, `I will most assuredly remove<a name="fnB1564" href="jer_note.htm#fn1564"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> you from the face of the earth. You will die this very year because you have counseled rebellion against the LORD.'"<a name="fnB1565" href="jer_note.htm#fn1565"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 17>17  In the seventh month of that very same year<a name="fnB1566" href="jer_note.htm#fn1566"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> the prophet Hananiah died.

Have you ever seen a man give birth to a baby?<br>

grabbing their stomachs in pain like<a name="fnB1642" href="jer_note.htm#fn1642"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> a woman giving birth?<br>
And why have their faces<br>

<bqverse 2>2  The LORD God of Israel told him to go and give King Zedekiah of Judah a message.

<bqverse 10>10  All the people and their leaders had agreed to this. They had agreed to let their male and female slaves go free and not keep them enslaved any longer.

<p><i>Judah's Unfaithfulness Contrasted with the Rechabites' Faithfulness</i>
<p><A NAME="35"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> The LORD spoke to Jeremiah when Jehoiakim son of Josiah was ruling over Judah.<a name="fnB1955" href="jer_note.htm#fn1955"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> He said,<a name="fnB1956" href="jer_note.htm#fn1956"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 3>3  So I went and got Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, the grandson of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons and all the rest of the Rechabite community. 
<bqverse 4>4  I took them to the LORD's temple. I took them into the room where the disciples of the prophet Hanan son of Igdaliah stayed.<a name="fnB1959" href="jer_note.htm#fn1959"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> That room was next to the one where the temple officers stayed and above the room where Maaseiah son of Shallum, one of the doorkeepers<a name="fnB1960" href="jer_note.htm#fn1960"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> of the temple, stayed. 
<bqverse 5>5  Then I set cups and pitchers full of wine in front of the members of the Rechabite community and said to them, "Have some wine."<a name="fnB1961" href="jer_note.htm#fn1961"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  But they answered, "We don't drink wine because our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab commanded us not to. He told us, `You and your children must never drink wine. 
<bqverse 7>7  Don't build houses. Don't plant crops. Don't plant a vineyard or own one.<a name="fnB1962" href="jer_note.htm#fn1962"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a><sup> </sup>Live in tents all your lives.

<bqverse 8>8  We and our wives and our sons and daughters have obeyed everything our ancestor Jonadab commanded us. We have never drunk wine.<a name="fnB1965" href="jer_note.htm#fn1965"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  We haven't built any houses to live in. We don't own any vineyards, fields, or crops. 
<bqverse 10>10  We have lived in tents. We have obeyed our ancestor Jonadab and done exactly as he commanded us.<a name="fnB1966" href="jer_note.htm#fn1966"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  But when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon invaded the land we said, `Let's get up and go to Jerusalem to get away from the Babylonian<a name="fnB1967" href="jer_note.htm#fn1967"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> and Aramean armies.' That is why we are staying here in Jerusalem."<p>

<bqverse 12>12  Then the LORD spoke to Jeremiah. 
<bqverse 13>13  The LORD God of Israel who rules over all<a name="fnB1968" href="jer_note.htm#fn1968"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> told him, "Go and speak to the people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem.

<bqverse 14>14  Jonadab son of Rechab ordered his descendants not to drink wine. And his orders have been carried out.<a name="fnB1972" href="jer_note.htm#fn1972"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> To this day his descendants have drunk no wine because they have obeyed what their ancestor commanded them. But I<a name="fnB1973" href="jer_note.htm#fn1973"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> have spoken to you over and over again<a name="fnB1974" href="jer_note.htm#fn1974"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> and you have not obeyed me. 
<bqverse 15>15  I sent all my servants the prophets to warn you over and over again. They said, "Every one of you, stop doing the evil things you have been doing and do what is right.<a name="fnB1975" href="jer_note.htm#fn1975"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> Don't pay allegiance to other gods<a name="fnB1976" href="jer_note.htm#fn1976"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> and worship them. Then you can continue to live in this land that I gave to you and your ancestors." But you did not pay any attention or listen to me. 
<bqverse 16>16  Yes,<a name="fnB1977" href="jer_note.htm#fn1977"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> the descendants of Jonadab son of Rechab have carried out the orders that their ancestor gave them. But you people<a name="fnB1978" href="jer_note.htm#fn1978"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> have not listened to me. 
<bqverse 17>17  So, I, the LORD, the God who rules over all, the God of Israel say,<a name="fnB1979" href="jer_note.htm#fn1979"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> "I will soon bring on Judah and all the citizens of Jerusalem all the disaster that I threatened to bring on them. I will do this because I spoke to them but they did not listen. I called out to them but they did not answer."'"<p>

<bqverse 18>18  Then Jeremiah spoke to the Rechabite community. He said, "The LORD God of Israel who rules over all<a name="fnB1980" href="jer_note.htm#fn1980"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> says, `You have obeyed the orders of your ancestor Jonadab.

<bqverse 19>19  So the LORD God of Israel who rules over all says, `Jonadab son of Rechab will never lack a male descendant to serve me.'"<a name="fnB1981" href="jer_note.htm#fn1981"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Jehoiakim Burns the Scroll Containing the LORD's Messages</i>
<p><A NAME="36"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> The LORD spoke to Jeremiah in the fourth year that Jehoakim son of Josiah was ruling over Judah.<a name="fnB1982" href="jer_note.htm#fn1982"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> He said,<a name="fnB1983" href="jer_note.htm#fn1983"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 3>3  Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about all the disaster I intend to bring on them, they will all stop doing the evil things they have been doing.<a name="fnB1987" href="jer_note.htm#fn1987"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> If they do, I will forgive their sins and the wicked things they have done."<a name="fnB1988" href="jer_note.htm#fn1988"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 4>4  So Jeremiah summoned Baruch son of Neriah. Then Jeremiah dictated to Baruch everything the LORD had told him to say and Baruch wrote it all down in a scroll.<a name="fnB1989" href="jer_note.htm#fn1989"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  Then Jeremiah told Baruch, "I am no longer allowed to go<a name="fnB1990" href="jer_note.htm#fn1990"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> into the LORD's temple. 
<bqverse 6>6  So you go there the next time all the people of Judah come in from their towns to fast<a name="fnB1991" href="jer_note.htm#fn1991"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> in the LORD's temple.

<bqverse 7>7  Perhaps then they will ask the LORD for mercy and will all stop doing the evil things they have been doing.<a name="fnB1993" href="jer_note.htm#fn1993"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> For the LORD has threatened to bring great anger and wrath against these people."<a name="fnB1994" href="jer_note.htm#fn1994"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 8>8  So Baruch son of Neriah did exactly what the prophet Jeremiah had told him to do. He read what the LORD had said from the scroll in the temple of the LORD.<a name="fnB1995" href="jer_note.htm#fn1995"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  All the people living in Jerusalem and all the people who came into Jerusalem from the towns of Judah came to observe a fast before the LORD. The fast took place in the ninth month of the fifth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was ruling over Judah.<a name="fnB1996" href="jer_note.htm#fn1996"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  At that time Baruch went into the temple of the LORD. He stood in the entrance of the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan who had been the royal secretary.<a name="fnB1997" href="jer_note.htm#fn1997"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> That room was in the upper court<a name="fnB1998" href="jer_note.htm#fn1998"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> near the entrance of the New Gate.<a name="fnB1999" href="jer_note.htm#fn1999"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> There, where all the people could hear him, he read from the scroll what Jeremiah had said.<a name="fnB2000" href="jer_note.htm#fn2000"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 11>11  Micaiah, who was the son of Gemariah and the grandson of Shaphan, heard Baruch read from the scroll everything the LORD had said.<a name="fnB2001" href="jer_note.htm#fn2001"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  He went down to the chamber of the royal secretary in the king's palace and found all the court officials in session there. Elishama<a name="fnB2002" href="jer_note.htm#fn2002"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> the royal secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor,<a name="fnB2003" href="jer_note.htm#fn2003"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials were seated there. 
<bqverse 13>13  Micaiah told them everything he had heard Baruch read from the scroll in the hearing of the people.<a name="fnB2004" href="jer_note.htm#fn2004"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  All the officials sent Jehudi, who was the son of Nethaniah and the grandson of Cushi, to Baruch. They ordered him to tell Baruch, "Come here and bring with you<a name="fnB2005" href="jer_note.htm#fn2005"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> the scroll you read in the hearing of the people."<a name="fnB2006" href="jer_note.htm#fn2006"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> So Baruch son of Neriah went to them, carrying the scroll in his hand.<a name="fnB2007" href="jer_note.htm#fn2007"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  They said to him, "Please sit down and read it to us." So Baruch sat down and read it to them.<a name="fnB2008" href="jer_note.htm#fn2008"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  When they had heard it all,<a name="fnB2009" href="jer_note.htm#fn2009"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> they expressed their alarm to one another.<a name="fnB2010" href="jer_note.htm#fn2010"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> Then they said to Baruch, "We must certainly give the king a report about everything you have read."<a name="fnB2011" href="jer_note.htm#fn2011"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  Then they asked Baruch, "How did you come to write all these words? Do they actually come from Jeremiah's mouth?"<a name="fnB2012" href="jer_note.htm#fn2012"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 18>18  And Baruch answered, "Yes, they came from his own mouth. He dictated all these words to me and I wrote them down in ink on this scroll."<a name="fnB2013" href="jer_note.htm#fn2013"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  Then the officials said to Baruch, "You and Jeremiah must go and hide. And you must not let anyone know where you are."<a name="fnB2014" href="jer_note.htm#fn2014"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 20>20  The officials put the scroll in the room of Elishama, the royal secretary, for safekeeping.<a name="fnB2015" href="jer_note.htm#fn2015"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> Then they went to the court and reported everything<a name="fnB2016" href="jer_note.htm#fn2016"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> to the king.<a name="fnB2017" href="jer_note.htm#fn2017"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll. He went and got it from the room of Elishama, the royal secretary.

<bqverse 22>22  Since it was the ninth month of the year, the king was sitting in his winter quarters.<a name="fnB2019" href="jer_note.htm#fn2019"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> A fire was burning in the firepot in front of him.<a name="fnB2020" href="jer_note.htm#fn2020"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23  As soon as Jehudi had read three or four columns<a name="fnB2021" href="jer_note.htm#fn2021"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> of the scroll, the king<a name="fnB2022" href="jer_note.htm#fn2022"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> would cut them off with a penknife<a name="fnB2023" href="jer_note.htm#fn2023"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> and throw them on the fire in the firepot. He kept doing so until the whole scroll was burned up in the fire.<a name="fnB2024" href="jer_note.htm#fn2024"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  Neither he nor any of his attendants showed any alarm when they heard all that had been read. Nor did they tear their clothes to show any grief or sorrow.<a name="fnB2025" href="jer_note.htm#fn2025"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  The king didn't even listen to Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah, who had urged him not to burn the scroll.<a name="fnB2026" href="jer_note.htm#fn2026"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  He even ordered Jerahmeel, one of the royal princes,<a name="fnB2027" href="jer_note.htm#fn2027"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelamiah son of Abdeel to arrest the scribe Baruch and the prophet Jeremiah.

<p><i>Baruch and Jeremiah Write Another Scroll </i>
<p>
<bqverse 27>27  The LORD spoke to Jeremiah after Jehoiakim had burned the scroll containing what Jeremiah had spoken and Baruch had written down. He said,<a name="fnB2028" href="jer_note.htm#fn2028"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  "Get another<a name="fnB2029" href="jer_note.htm#fn2029"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> scroll and write on it everything<a name="fnB2030" href="jer_note.htm#fn2030"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> that was written on the original scroll<a name="fnB2031" href="jer_note.htm#fn2031"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> that King Jehoiakim of Judah burned. 
<bqverse 29>29  And tell King Jehoiakim of Judah, `The LORD says, "You burned the scroll.

<bqverse 30>30  So the LORD says concerning King Jehoiakim of Judah, "None of his line will occupy the throne of David.<a name="fnB2034" href="jer_note.htm#fn2034"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> And his dead body will be thrown out to be exposed to scorching heat by day and frost by night.<a name="fnB2035" href="jer_note.htm#fn2035"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 31>31  I will punish him and his descendants and the officials who serve him for the wicked things they have done.<a name="fnB2036" href="jer_note.htm#fn2036"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> I will bring on them and the citizens of Jerusalem and the people of Judah all the disaster that I threatened to do to them.

<bqverse 32>32  Then Jeremiah got another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah.

<p><i>The LORD Responds to Zedekiah's Hope for Help</i>
<p>
<bqverse 3>3  King Zedekiah sent<a name="fnB2042" href="jer_note.htm#fn2042"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> Jehucal<a name="fnB2043" href="jer_note.htm#fn2043"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> son of Shelemiah and the priest Zephaniah<a name="fnB2044" href="jer_note.htm#fn2044"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> son of Maaseiah to the prophet Jeremiah. He told them to say, "Please pray to the LORD our God on our behalf." 
<bqverse 4>4  (Now Jeremiah had not yet been put in prison.<a name="fnB2045" href="jer_note.htm#fn2045"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> So he was still free to come and go among the people as he pleased.<a name="fnB2046" href="jer_note.htm#fn2046"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5 At that time the Babylonian forces<a name="fnB2047" href="jer_note.htm#fn2047"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> had temporarily given up their siege against Jerusalem. They had had it under siege, but withdrew when they heard that the army of Pharaoh had set out from Egypt.<a name="fnB2048" href="jer_note.htm#fn2048"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a>) 
<bqverse 6>6  The LORD gave the prophet Jeremiah a message for them. He told him to tell them,<a name="fnB2049" href="jer_note.htm#fn2049"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  "The LORD God of Israel says, `Give a message to the king of Judah who sent you to ask me to help him.<a name="fnB2050" href="jer_note.htm#fn2050"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a><sup> </sup>Tell him, "The army of Pharaoh that was on its way to help you will go back home to Egypt.<a name="fnB2051" href="jer_note.htm#fn2051"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  Then the Babylonian forces<a name="fnB2052" href="jer_note.htm#fn2052"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> will return. They will attack the city and will capture it and burn it down.

<p><i>Jeremiah Charged with Deserting, Arrested, and Imprisoned</i>
<p>
<bqverse 11>11  The following events also occurred<a name="fnB2057" href="jer_note.htm#fn2057"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> while the Babylonian forces<a name="fnB2058" href="jer_note.htm#fn2058"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> had temporarily withdrawn from Jerusalem because the army of Pharaoh was coming. 
<bqverse 12>12  Jeremiah started out to leave Jerusalem to go to the territory of Benjamin. He wanted to make sure he got his share of the property that was being divided up among his family there.<a name="fnB2059" href="jer_note.htm#fn2059"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  But he only got as far as the Benjamin Gate.<a name="fnB2060" href="jer_note.htm#fn2060"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> There an officer in charge of the guards named Irijah,<a name="fnB2061" href="jer_note.htm#fn2061"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> who was the son of Shelemiah and the grandson of Hananiah, stopped him. He seized Jeremiah and said,<a name="fnB2062" href="jer_note.htm#fn2062"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> "You are deserting to the Babylonians!"<a name="fnB2063" href="jer_note.htm#fn2063"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  Jeremiah answered, "That's a lie! I am not deserting to the Babylonians."<a name="fnB2064" href="jer_note.htm#fn2064"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> But Irijah wouldn't listen to him. Irijah put Jeremiah under arrest and took him to the officials. 
<bqverse 15>15  The officials were very angry<a name="fnB2065" href="jer_note.htm#fn2065"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> at Jeremiah. They had him flogged and put in prison in the house of Jonathan, the royal secretary, which they had converted into a place for confining prisoners.<a name="fnB2066" href="jer_note.htm#fn2066"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 16>16  So<a name="fnB2067" href="jer_note.htm#fn2067"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> Jeremiah was put in prison, in a cell in the dungeon in Jonathan's house.<a name="fnB2068" href="jer_note.htm#fn2068"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> He<a name="fnB2069" href="jer_note.htm#fn2069"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> was kept there for a long time. 
<bqverse 17>17  Then King Zedekiah had him brought to the palace. There he questioned him privately and asked him,<a name="fnB2070" href="jer_note.htm#fn2070"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> "Is there any message from the LORD?" Jeremiah answered, "Yes, there is." Then he added,<a name="fnB2071" href="jer_note.htm#fn2071"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> "You will be handed over to the king of Babylon."<a name="fnB2072" href="jer_note.htm#fn2072"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  Then Jeremiah asked King Zedekiah, "What crime have I committed against you, or the officials who serve you, or the people of Judah? What have I done to make you people throw me into prison?<a name="fnB2073" href="jer_note.htm#fn2073"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  Where now are the prophets who prophesied to you that<a name="fnB2074" href="jer_note.htm#fn2074"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> the king of Babylon wouldn't attack you or this land? 
<bqverse 20>20  But now please listen, your royal Majesty,<a name="fnB2075" href="jer_note.htm#fn2075"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> and grant my plea for mercy.<a name="fnB2076" href="jer_note.htm#fn2076"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> Don't send me back to the house of Jonathan, the royal secretary. If you do, I will die there."<a name="fnB2077" href="jer_note.htm#fn2077"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  Then King Zedekiah ordered that Jeremiah be committed to the courtyard of the guardhouse. He also ordered that a loaf of bread<a name="fnB2078" href="jer_note.htm#fn2078"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> be given to him every day from the baker's street until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah was kept<a name="fnB2079" href="jer_note.htm#fn2079"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> in the courtyard of the guardhouse.

They had heard him say, 
<bqverse 2>2  "The LORD says, `Those who stay in this city will die in battle or of starvation or disease.<a name="fnB2083" href="jer_note.htm#fn2083"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> Those who leave the city and surrender to the Babylonians<a name="fnB2084" href="jer_note.htm#fn2084"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> will live.

<bqverse 4>4  So these officials said to the king, "This man must be put to death.

<p><i>An Ethiopian Official Rescues Jeremiah from the Cistern</i>
<p>
<bqverse 7>7  An Ethiopian, Ebed Melech,<a name="fnB2098" href="jer_note.htm#fn2098"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> a court official in the royal palace, heard that Jeremiah had been put<a name="fnB2099" href="jer_note.htm#fn2099"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> in the cistern. While the king was holding court<a name="fnB2100" href="jer_note.htm#fn2100"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> at the Benjamin Gate, 
<bqverse 8>8  Ebed Melech left the palace and went to speak to the king. He said to him, 
<bqverse 9>9 "Your royal Majesty, those men have been very wicked in all that they have done to the prophet Jeremiah. They have thrown him into a cistern and he is sure to die of starvation there because there isn't any food left in the city.<a name="fnB2101" href="jer_note.htm#fn2101"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  Then the king gave Ebed Melech the Ethiopian the following order: "Take thirty<a name="fnB2102" href="jer_note.htm#fn2102"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> men with you from here and go pull the prophet Jeremiah out of the cistern before he dies." 
<bqverse 11>11  So Ebed Melech took the men with him and went to a room under the treasure room in the palace.<a name="fnB2103" href="jer_note.htm#fn2103"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> He got some worn-out clothes and old rags<a name="fnB2104" href="jer_note.htm#fn2104"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> from there and let them down by ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern. 
<bqverse 12>12  Ebed Melech<a name="fnB2105" href="jer_note.htm#fn2105"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> called down to Jeremiah, "Put these rags and worn out clothes under your armpits to pad the ropes.<a name="fnB2106" href="jer_note.htm#fn2106"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> Jeremiah did as Ebed Melech instructed.<a name="fnB2107" href="jer_note.htm#fn2107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  So they pulled Jeremiah up from the cistern with ropes. Jeremiah, however, still remained confined<a name="fnB2108" href="jer_note.htm#fn2108"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> to the courtyard of the guardhouse.<a name="_Toc494012762"></a></p>
<p><i>Jeremiah Responds to Zedekiah's Request for Secret Advice</i>

<bqverse 14>14  Some time later<a name="fnB2109" href="jer_note.htm#fn2109"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> Zedekiah sent and had Jeremiah brought to him at the third entrance<a name="fnB2110" href="jer_note.htm#fn2110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> of the LORD's temple. The king said to Jeremiah, "I would like to ask you a question. Don't hide anything from me when you answer."<a name="fnB2111" href="jer_note.htm#fn2111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "If I answer you, you will certainly kill me.<a name="fnB2112" href="jer_note.htm#fn2112"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> If I give you advice, you won't listen to me." 
<bqverse 16>16  So King Zedekiah made a secret promise to Jeremiah and sealed it with an oath. He promised,<a name="fnB2113" href="jer_note.htm#fn2113"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> "As surely as the LORD lives who has given us life and breath,<a name="fnB2114" href="jer_note.htm#fn2114"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> I promise you this: I will not kill you or hand you over to those men who want to kill you."<a name="fnB2115" href="jer_note.htm#fn2115"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 17>17  Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "The LORD, the God who rules over all, the God of Israel,<a name="fnB2116" href="jer_note.htm#fn2116"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> says, `You must by all means surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon.

Indeed, you and your whole family will be spared. 
<bqverse 18>18  But if you do not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, this city will be handed over to the Babylonians<a name="fnB2118" href="jer_note.htm#fn2118"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> and they will burn it down. And you yourself will not escape from them.'"<a name="fnB2119" href="jer_note.htm#fn2119"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Babylonians.<a name="fnB2120" href="jer_note.htm#fn2120"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> The Babylonians might hand me over to them and they will torture me."<a name="fnB2121" href="jer_note.htm#fn2121"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  Then Jeremiah answered, "You won't be handed over to them.

<bqverse 21>21  But if you refuse to surrender, the LORD has shown me a vision of what will happen. Here is what I saw: 
<bqverse 22>22  All the women who are left in the royal palace of Judah will be led out to the officers of the king of Babylon. They will taunt you saying,<a name="fnB2124" href="jer_note.htm#fn2124"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a></p>
<br>`Your trusted friends misled you <br>

they turned their backs on you.'<a name="fnB2125" href="jer_note.htm#fn2125"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a></ul><p>
<bqverse 23>23  "All your wives and your children will be led out to the Babylonians.<a name="fnB2126" href="jer_note.htm#fn2126"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> You yourself will not escape from them but will be captured by the<a name="fnB2127" href="jer_note.htm#fn2127"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> king of Babylon.

<bqverse 24>24  Then Zedekiah told Jeremiah, "Don't let anyone know about the conversation we have had.<a name="fnB2129" href="jer_note.htm#fn2129"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> If you do, you will die.<a name="fnB2130" href="jer_note.htm#fn2130"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  The officials may hear that I have talked with you.

<bqverse 26>26  If they do, tell<a name="fnB2133" href="jer_note.htm#fn2133"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> them, `I was pleading with the king not to send me back to die in the dungeon of Jonathan's house.'"<a name="fnB2134" href="jer_note.htm#fn2134"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  All the officials did come and question Jeremiah.<a name="fnB2135" href="jer_note.htm#fn2135"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> He told them exactly what the king had instructed him to say.<a name="fnB2136" href="jer_note.htm#fn2136"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> They gave up questioning him any further because no one had actually heard their conversation.<a name="fnB2137" href="jer_note.htm#fn2137"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  So Jeremiah remained confined<a name="fnB2138" href="jer_note.htm#fn2138"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> in the courtyard of the guardhouse until the day Jerusalem was captured.

They caught up with Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho and captured him.<a name="fnB2148" href="jer_note.htm#fn2148"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> They took him to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon at Riblah<a name="fnB2149" href="jer_note.htm#fn2149"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> in the territory of Hamath and Nebuchadnezzar passed sentence on him there. 
<bqverse 6>6  There at Riblah the king of Babylon had Zedekiah's sons put to death while Zedekiah was looking on. The king of Babylon also had all the nobles of Judah put to death. 
<bqverse 7>7  Then he had Zedekiah's eyes put out and had him bound in chains<a name="fnB2150" href="jer_note.htm#fn2150"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> to be led off to Babylon. 
<bqverse 8>8  The Babylonians<a name="fnB2151" href="jer_note.htm#fn2151"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> burned down the royal palace, the temple of the LORD, and the people's homes<a name="fnB2152" href="jer_note.htm#fn2152"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> and tore down the wall of Jerusalem.<a name="fnB2153" href="jer_note.htm#fn2153"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard,<a name="fnB2154" href="jer_note.htm#fn2154"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> took captive the rest of the people who were left in the city. He carried them off to Babylon along with the people who had deserted to him.<a name="fnB2155" href="jer_note.htm#fn2155"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  But he<a name="fnB2156" href="jer_note.htm#fn2156"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> left behind in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing. He gave them fields and vineyards at that time.<p>

<bqverse 11>11  Now King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had issued orders concerning Jeremiah. He had passed them on through Nebuzaradan, the captain of his royal guard. He had ordered,<a name="fnB2157" href="jer_note.htm#fn2157"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12 "Find Jeremiah<a name="fnB2158" href="jer_note.htm#fn2158"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> and look out for him.<a name="fnB2159" href="jer_note.htm#fn2159"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> Don't do anything to harm him<a name="fnB2160" href="jer_note.htm#fn2160"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> but do with him whatever he tells you to." 
<bqverse 13>13  So Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard, Nebushazban, a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer, a high official,<a name="fnB2161" href="jer_note.htm#fn2161"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> and all the other officers of the king of Babylon 
<bqverse 14>14 sent and had Jeremiah brought from the courtyard of the guardhouse. They turned him over to Gedaliah,<a name="fnB2162" href="jer_note.htm#fn2162"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> the son of Ahikam and the grandson of Shaphan, to take him home with him.<a name="fnB2163" href="jer_note.htm#fn2163"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> But Jeremiah stayed among the people.<a name="fnB2164" href="jer_note.htm#fn2164"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494012764"></a></p>

<p><i>Jeremiah Is Set Free A Second Time</i>
<p><A NAME="40"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> The LORD spoke to Jeremiah<a name="fnB2176" href="jer_note.htm#fn2176"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> after Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard, had set him free at Ramah.<a name="fnB2177" href="jer_note.htm#fn2177"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> He had taken him there in chains<a name="fnB2178" href="jer_note.htm#fn2178"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> along with all the people from Jerusalem and Judah who were being carried off to exile to Babylon. 
<bqverse 2>2  The captain of the royal guard took Jeremiah aside and said to him, "The LORD your God threatened this place with this disaster 
<bqverse 3>3  and now he has brought it about. The LORD has done just what he threatened he would do. This disaster has happened because you people sinned against the LORD and did not obey him.<a name="fnB2179" href="jer_note.htm#fn2179"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  But now, Jeremiah, today I am going to set you free<a name="fnB2180" href="jer_note.htm#fn2180"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> from the chains on your wrists. If you would like to come to Babylon with me, come along and I will look out for you.<a name="fnB2181" href="jer_note.htm#fn2181"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> But if you would prefer not to come to Babylon with me, you don't have to.<a name="fnB2182" href="jer_note.htm#fn2182"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> You are free to go anywhere in the land you want to go.<a name="fnB2183" href="jer_note.htm#fn2183"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> Go wherever you think is best and right."<a name="fnB2184" href="jer_note.htm#fn2184"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  And before Jeremiah could turn to leave, the captain of the guard added, "Go back<a name="fnB2185" href="jer_note.htm#fn2185"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon appointed to govern<a name="fnB2186" href="jer_note.htm#fn2186"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> the towns of Judah.

Then the captain of the guard gave Jeremiah some food and a present and let him go. 
<bqverse 6>6  So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah<a name="fnB2188" href="jer_note.htm#fn2188"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> and lived there with him. He stayed there to live among the people who had been left in the land of Judah.<a name="fnB2189" href="jer_note.htm#fn2189"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494012766"></a></p>
<p><i>A Small Judean Province is Established at Mizpah</i>
<p>
<bqverse 7>7  Some of the officers of the Judean army and their troops had been hiding in the countryside. They heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam to govern<a name="fnB2190" href="jer_note.htm#fn2190"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> the country. They also heard that he had been put in charge over the men, women, and children from the poorer classes of the land who had not been carried off into exile in Babylon.<a name="fnB2191" href="jer_note.htm#fn2191"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  So<a name="fnB2192" href="jer_note.htm#fn2192"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> all these officers and their troops came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. The officers who came were Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah son of the Maachathite.<a name="fnB2193" href="jer_note.htm#fn2193"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, took an oath so as to give them and their troops some assurance of safety.<a name="fnB2194" href="jer_note.htm#fn2194"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> He said, "You don't need to be afraid to submit to the Babylonians.<a name="fnB2195" href="jer_note.htm#fn2195"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> Settle down in the land and submit to the king of Babylon. Then things will go well for you. 
<bqverse 10>10  I for my part will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians<a name="fnB2196" href="jer_note.htm#fn2196"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> whenever they come to us. You for your part go ahead and harvest the wine, the dates and figs,<a name="fnB2197" href="jer_note.htm#fn2197"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> and the olive oil and store them in jars. Go ahead and settle down in the towns that you have taken over."<a name="fnB2198" href="jer_note.htm#fn2198"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  Moreover, all the Judeans who were in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and all the other countries heard what had happened. They heard that the king of Babylon had let some people stay in Judah and that he had appointed Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, to govern them. 
<bqverse 12>12  So all these Judeans returned to the land of Judah from the places where they had been scattered. They came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. And they harvested a large amount of wine and dates and figs.<a name="fnB2199" href="jer_note.htm#fn2199"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494012767"></a></p>
<p><i>Ishmael Murders Gedaliah and Carries the Judeans at Mizpah off as Captives</i>
<p>
<bqverse 13>13  Johanan and all the officers of the troops that had been hiding in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. 
<bqverse 14>14  They said to him, "Are you at all aware<a name="fnB2200" href="jer_note.htm#fn2200"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> that King Baalis of Ammon has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to kill you?" But Gedaliah son of Ahikam would not believe them. 
<bqverse 15>15  Then Johanan son of Kareah spoke privately to Gedaliah there at Mizpah. He said, "Let me go and kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah before anyone knows about it. Otherwise he will kill you<a name="fnB2201" href="jer_note.htm#fn2201"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> and all the Judeans who have rallied around you will be scattered. Then what is left of Judah will disappear." 
<bqverse 16>16  But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, "Don't do that,<a name="fnB2202" href="jer_note.htm#fn2202"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> because what you are saying about Ishmael isn't true."<a name="fnB2203" href="jer_note.htm#fn2203"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqchapter 41><A NAME="41"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> But in the seventh month<a name="fnB2204" href="jer_note.htm#fn2204"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah and grandson of Elishama, who was a member of the royal family and had been one of Zedekiah's chief officers, came with ten of his men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah. While they were eating a meal together with him there at Mizpah, 
<bqverse 2>2  Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him stood up, pulled out their swords, and killed Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan. Thus Ishmael killed the man that the king of Babylon had appointed to govern the country. 
<bqverse 3>3  Ishmael also killed all the Judeans<a name="fnB2205" href="jer_note.htm#fn2205"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah and the Babylonian<a name="fnB2206" href="jer_note.htm#fn2206"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> soldiers who happened to be<a name="fnB2207" href="jer_note.htm#fn2207"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> there.<p>

<bqverse 4>4  On the day after Gedaliah had been murdered, before anyone even knew about it, 
<bqverse 5>5  eighty men arrived from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria.<a name="fnB2208" href="jer_note.htm#fn2208"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> They had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes, and cut themselves to show their mourning.<a name="fnB2209" href="jer_note.htm#fn2209"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> They were carrying grain offerings and incense to present at the temple of the LORD in Jerusalem.<a name="fnB2210" href="jer_note.htm#fn2210"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them. He was pretending to cry<a name="fnB2211" href="jer_note.htm#fn2211"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> as he walked along. When he met them, he said to them, "Come with me to meet Gedaliah son of Ahikam."<a name="fnB2212" href="jer_note.htm#fn2212"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  But as soon as they were inside the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them and threw their bodies<a name="fnB2213" href="jer_note.htm#fn2213"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> in a cistern. 
<bqverse 8>8  But there were ten men among them who said<a name="fnB2214" href="jer_note.htm#fn2214"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> to Ishmael, "Don't kill us. For we will give you the stores of wheat, barley, olive oil, and honey we have hidden in a field.<a name="fnB2215" href="jer_note.htm#fn2215"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> So he let them alone and didn't kill<a name="fnB2216" href="jer_note.htm#fn2216"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> them along with the rest.<a name="fnB2217" href="jer_note.htm#fn2217"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  Now the cistern where Ishmael threw all the dead bodies of those he had killed was a large one<a name="fnB2218" href="jer_note.htm#fn2218"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> that King Asa had constructed as part of his defenses against King Baasha of Israel.<a name="fnB2219" href="jer_note.htm#fn2219"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with dead bodies.<a name="fnB2220" href="jer_note.htm#fn2220"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  Then Ishmael took captive all the people who were still left alive in Mizpah. This included the royal princesses<a name="fnB2221" href="jer_note.htm#fn2221"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and all the rest of the people in Mizpah that Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard, had put under the authority of Gedaliah son of Ahikam.

<p><i>Johanan Rescues the People Ishmael Had Carried Off </i>

<bqverse 11>11  Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him heard about all the atrocities<a name="fnB2222" href="jer_note.htm#fn2222"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> that Ishmael son of Nethaniah had committed. 
<bqverse 12>12  So they took all their troops and went to fight against Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They caught up with him near the large pool<a name="fnB2223" href="jer_note.htm#fn2223"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> at Gibeon. 
<bqverse 13>13  When all the people that Ishmael had taken captive saw<a name="fnB2224" href="jer_note.htm#fn2224"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers with him, they were glad. 
<bqverse 14>14  All those people that Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned and went over to Johanan son of Kareah. 
<bqverse 15>15  But Ishmael son of Nethaniah managed to escape from Johanan along with eight of his men, and he went on over to Ammon.<p>

<bqverse 16>16  Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him led off all the people who had been left alive at Mizpah.

<bqverse 12>12  But the time is coming when I will send<br>

<bqverse 16>16  Moab's destruction is at hand.<br>
Disaster will come on it quickly.<br>

<bqverse 17>17  Mourn for that nation, all you nations living around it<br>
and all of you nations that know of its fame.<a name="fnB2450" href="jer_note.htm#fn2450"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a><br>

Ask them, `What has happened?'<br>

<bqverse 34>34  Cries of anguish raised from Heshbon and Elealeh<br>

They will be sounded from Zoar as far as Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah.<br>
For even the waters of Nimrim will be dried up.<br>

<bqverse 35>35  I will put an end in Moab<br>
to those who make offerings at her places of worship.<a name="fnB2476" href="jer_note.htm#fn2476"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 36>36  So my heart moans for Moab<br>

Yes, like a flute playing a funeral song,<br>

For the wealth they have gained will perish.<br>

They will all put on sackcloth.<a name="fnB2478" href="jer_note.htm#fn2478"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 38>38  On all the housetops in Moab<br>

Oh, how she will turn away<a name="fnB2480" href="jer_note.htm#fn2480"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> in shame!<br>

<bqverse 1>1 </b><a name="fnB2835" href="jer_note.htm#fn2835"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he ruled in Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother's name was Hamutal<a name="fnB2836" href="jer_note.htm#fn2836"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> daughter of Jeremiah, from Libnah. 
<bqverse 2>2  He did what displeased the LORD,<a name="fnB2837" href="jer_note.htm#fn2837"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> exactly like Jehoiakim had done.<p>

<bqverse 3>3  What follows is a record of what happened to Jerusalem and Judah because of the LORD's anger; he finally drove them out of his sight.<a name="fnB2838" href="jer_note.htm#fn2838"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 
<bqverse 4>4  King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came against Jerusalem with his whole army and set up camp outside<a name="fnB2839" href="jer_note.htm#fn2839"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> it. They built siege ramps all around it.

<bqverse 5>5  The city remained under siege until Zedekiah's eleventh year.

<bqverse 7>7  They broke through the city walls, and all the soldiers tried to escape. They left the city during the night. They went through the gate between the two walls that is near the king's garden.<a name="fnB2843" href="jer_note.htm#fn2843"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> (The Babylonians were all around the city.)

<bqverse 8>8  But the Babylonian army chased after the king. They caught up with Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and his entire army deserted him. 
<bqverse 9>9  They captured him and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah<a name="fnB2845" href="jer_note.htm#fn2845"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> in the territory of Hamath and he passed sentence on him there. 
<bqverse 10>10  The king of Babylon had Zedekiah's sons put to death while Zedekiah was looking on. He also had all the nobles of Judah put to death there at Riblah. 
<bqverse 11>11  He had Zedekiah's eyes put out and had him bound in chains.<a name="fnB2846" href="jer_note.htm#fn2846"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> Then the king of Babylon had him led off to Babylon and he was imprisoned there until the day he died.<p>

<bqverse 14>14  The whole Babylonian army that came with the captain of the royal guard tore down the walls that surrounded Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 15>15  Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard, took into exile some of the poor,<a name="fnB2851" href="jer_note.htm#fn2851"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> the rest of the people who were left in the city, those who had deserted to him, and the rest of the craftsmen.

<bqverse 19>19  The captain of the royal guard took the gold and silver bowls, censers,<a name="fnB2858" href="jer_note.htm#fn2858"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> basins, pots, lampstands, pans, and vessels.<a name="fnB2859" href="jer_note.htm#fn2859"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  The bronze of the items that King Solomon made for the LORD's temple (including the two pillars, the big bronze basin called "The Sea," the twelve bronze bulls under "The Sea," and the movable stands<a name="fnB2860" href="jer_note.htm#fn2860"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a>) was too heavy to be weighed. 
<bqverse 21>21  Each of the pillars was about twenty-seven feet<a name="fnB2861" href="jer_note.htm#fn2861"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> high, about eighteen feet<a name="fnB2862" href="jer_note.htm#fn2862"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> in circumference, four fingers thick, and hollow.

The second pillar with its pomegranate-shaped ornaments was like it. 
<bqverse 23>23  There were ninety-six pomegranate-shaped ornaments on the sides; in all there were one hundred pomegranate-shaped ornaments over the latticework that went around it.<p>

<bqverse 24>24  The captain of the royal guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest who was second in rank, and the three doorkeepers.<a name="fnB2864" href="jer_note.htm#fn2864"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  From the city he took an official who was in charge of the soldiers, seven of the king's advisers who were discovered in the city, an official army secretary who drafted citizens<a name="fnB2865" href="jer_note.htm#fn2865"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> for military service, and sixty citizens who were discovered in the middle of the city. 
<bqverse 26>26  Nebuzaradan, captain of the royal guard, took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
<bqverse 27>27  The king of Babylon ordered them to be executed<a name="fnB2866" href="jer_note.htm#fn2866"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> at Riblah in the territory of Hamath.<p>

<bqverse 33>33  Jehoiachin<a name="fnB2875" href="jer_note.htm#fn2875"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> took off his prison clothes and ate daily in the king's presence for the rest of his life.
