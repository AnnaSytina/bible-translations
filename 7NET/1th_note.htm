 <b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Grk</i> "Paul." The word "from" is not in the Greek text, but has been supplied to indicate the sender of the letter.<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="1th.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:1)  The majority of witnesses add <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajpoV qeou' patroV" hJmw'n kaiV kuriou' Ihsou' Cristou'</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">apo qeou patro" Jhmwn kai kuriou Ihsou Cristou</FONT>, "from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ") to the end of v. 1. The shorter reading is supported by B F G <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Y</FONT> 0278 1739 1881 lat <i>et pauci</i>. Apart from a desire to omit the redundancy of the mention of God and Christ in this verse, there is no good reason why scribes would have omitted the characteristically Pauline greeting. (Further, if this were the case, why did these same scribes overlook such an opportunity in 2 Thess 1:1-2?) On the other hand, since 1 Thessalonians is one of Paul's earliest letters, what would become characteristic of his greetings seems to have been still in embryonic form (e.g., he does not yet call his audience "saints" [which will first be used in his address to the Corinthians], nor does he use <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">en</FONT>) followed by the dative to refer to the location of the church). Thus, the internal evidence is overwhelming in support of the shorter reading, for scribes would have been strongly motivated to rework this salutation in light of Paul's style elsewhere. And the external evidence, though not overwhelming, is supportive of this shorter reading, found as it is in some of the best witnesses of the Alexandrian and Western texttypes.<br>
 <b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Grk</i> "Grace to you and peace." <br>

 <a name="fn5" href="1th.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  These phrases denote Christian virtues in action: the work produced by faith, labor motivated by love, and endurance that stems from hope in Christ.<br>
 <a name="fn6" href="1th.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  <i>Grk</i> "knowing."

 <a name="fn10" href="1th.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  <i>Grk</i> "just as you know what sort of people we were among you for your sakes." Verse 5 reflects on the experience of Paul and his fellow preachers; v. 6 begins to describe the Thessalonians' response.<br>

 <a name="fn12" href="1th.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:8)  Or "the word of the Lord."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:8)  "The word of the Lord" is a technical expression in OT literature, often referring to a divine prophetic utterance (e.g., Gen 15:1, Isa 1:10, Jonah 1:1). In the NT it occurs 15 times: 3 times as <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">rJh'ma tou' kurivou</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">rJhma tou kuriou</FONT>; Luke 22:61, Acts 11:16, 1 Pet 1:25) and 12 times as <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">lovgo" tou' kurivou</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">logo" tou kuriou</FONT>; here and in Acts 8:25; 13:44, 48, 49; 15:35, 36; 16:32; 19:10, 20; 1 Thes 4:15; 2 Thes 3:1). As in the OT, this phrase focuses on the prophetic nature and divine origin of what has been said. Here the phrase has been translated "the message of the Lord" because of the focus upon the spread of the gospel evident in the passage.<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="1th.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:8)  <i>Grk</i> "your faith in God has gone out."<br>

 <a name="fn16" href="1th.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:10)  The Alexandrian witnesses almost uniformly support <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejk</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ek</FONT>) here (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> A B P 0278 33 81 1739 1881 <i>et pauci</i>). However, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajpov</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">apo</FONT>) is solid in the Western and Byzantine texts (C D F G <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Y</FONT> <i>Byz</i> latt). Admittedly, the Alexandrian reading is to be preferred on external grounds, but as Zuntz noted long ago, a solid Western-Byzantine alignment most likely goes deep into the 2nd century. Further, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejk</FONT> has all the ear-marks of being a motivated reading, since it follows the two previous mentions of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejk</FONT> in this verse. Not only this, but it could easily be an instance of dittography. Finally, Paul's style is such that he often mixes his prepositions, especially <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejk</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajpov</FONT> (cf., e.g., 2:5). Thus, the transcriptional and intrinsic probability that <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajpov</FONT> is original is quite strong, and the external evidence is supportive of this. (For a more detailed discussion, see D. B. Wallace, "A Textual Problem in 1 Thessalonians 1:10: <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">*Ek th'" *Orgh'" </FONT>Vs. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">*ApoV th'" *Orgh'"</FONT>," <i>BSac</i> 147 [1990]: 470-79.)<br>

Paul is defending himself against the charge that he lacked earnestness and personal concern for them, but appeared in their city out of greed or egotism. In his defense he appeals to what they recall of his ministry and what has become of it since he left, all of which demonstrates his God-given earnestness and effectiveness.<br>
 <a name="fn20" href="1th.htm#fnB20"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:3)  <i>Grk</i> "For our exhortation." Paul here uses <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">paravklhsi" </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">paraklhsis</FONT>) to speak in broad terms about his preaching of the gospel, in which he urges or appeals to people to respond to God's salvation (cf. the verb form <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">parakalou'nto" </FONT>[<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">parakalounto"</FONT>] in 2 Cor 5:20).<br>

It is not insignificant that the earliest Alexandrian and Western witnesses in support of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">h[pioi</FONT> are the <i>second</i> correctors. Such correctors generally follow a Byzantine <i>Vorlage</i>. Hence, apart from A 33 1739, the variant <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">h[pioi</FONT> is virtually shut up to the Byzantine text. The reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">nhvpioi</FONT> is thus superior externally. Further, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">nhvpioi</FONT> is much harder in this context, for Paul mixes his metaphors ("we became little children in your midst... Like a nursing mother..."). Thus, the scribes would naturally alter this reading to the softer <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">h[pioi</FONT> ("we became gentle..."). Paul is not known for his consistency of figures, however (cf., e.g., Gal 4:19); hence, the intrinsic evidence points to <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">nhvpioi</FONT> as original. On the other hand, it is possible that <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">nhvpioi</FONT> was caused by dittography with the preceding <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">-men</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">-men</FONT>). It is even possible that <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">nhvpioi</FONT> was caused by an error of hearing right from the beginning: the amanuensis could have heard Paul incorrectly. But such a supposition cuts both ways; further, Paul would no doubt have corrected the reading in the MS before it was sent out. If so, one would surely have expected both earlier witnesses on the side of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">h[pioi</FONT> and perhaps a few first correctors to have this reading. The reading "little children" thus stands as most probably original.<br>
 <a name="fn25" href="1th.htm#fnB25"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:8)  <i>Grk</i> "longing for you in this way."<br>

This is quite obviously a secondary reading. Marcion's influence may stand behind part of the tradition, but the Byzantine text probably added the adjective in light of its mention in v. 14 and as a clarification of which prophets were in view.<br>

The Greek word translated <i>received</i> is used for accepting instructions passed on as fixed traditions from teacher to follower. Paul speaks in these terms about doctrinal traditions as well as ethical instruction that he passes on to his converts and expects them to keep (cf. 1 Cor 11:2, 23; 15:1-3; Gal 1:9; Phil 4:9; 2 Thess 2:15; 3:6).<br>

This metaphorical usage by its very nature emphasizes the hope of resurrection: believers will one day "wake up" out of death. Here the term refers to death, but "sleep" was used in the translation to emphasize the metaphorical, rhetorical usage of the term. This word also occurs in vv. 14 and 15. <br>
 <a name="fn71" href="1th.htm#fnB71"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:14)  "we believe that" is understood from the first clause of the verse, which is parallel. <i>Grk</i> "so also God will bring."<br>

It is possible that "through Jesus" describes "bring," but this gives the unlikely double reference, "through Jesus God will bring them with Jesus." Instead it describes their "falling sleep," since through him their death is only sleep and not the threat it once was. Also Christians are those whose total existence--life and death--is in and through and for Christ (1 Cor 8:6).<br>

 <a name="fn77" href="1th.htm#fnB77"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:1)  <i>Grk</i> "concerning the times and the seasons," a reference to future periods of eschatological fulfillment (cf. Acts 1:7). <br>

 <a name="fn79" href="1th.htm#fnB79"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:2)  The<i> day of the Lord</i> is the period of time in the future when the Lord will intervene in the events of this earth to consummate his redemption and his judgment (Isa 2:11-12; 13:6-13; Ezek 30:3; Joel 1:15; 2:32; 3:18; Amos 5:18-20; Obad 15-17; Zeph 1:7-18; 2:2-3; Zech 14:1, 13, 20-21; Mal 4:1, 5; 1 Cor 1:8; 5:5; 2 Cor 1:14; 2 Thess 2:2; 2 Pet 3:10). It includes both blessings and curses, though the latter is emphasized here.<br>
 <a name="fn80" href="1th.htm#fnB80"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:2)  Jesus used a <i>thief</i> coming at <i>night</i> as an illustration of the unexpected and hostile nature of the coming of God's judgment in the future. This is repeated in various ways in v. 4; 2 Pet 3:10; Rev 3:3; 16:15.<br>

Although normally the shorter reading is to be preferred, the external evidence is superior for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dev</FONT> (being found in the better Alexandrian and Western witnesses). What, then, is to explain the <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">gavr</FONT>? It seems to have been derived from the shorter reading (since the Byzantine archetype was based on available Alexandrian and Western witnesses). Internally, the omission of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dev</FONT> looks unintentional, a case of homoioarcton (<FONT FACE="GREEK UNCIALS">otandelegwsin</FONT>). Further, scribes were prone to replace <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dev</FONT> with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">gavr</FONT>, especially in sentences suggesting a causal or explanatory idea.<br>

 <a name="fn88" href="1th.htm#fnB88"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:10)  <i>Grk</i> "the one who died," describing Jesus Christ (1 Thess 5:9). Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started at the beginning of v. 10 in the translation.<br>
 <a name="fn89" href="1th.htm#fnB89"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:10)  The phrases<i> alert or asleep</i> may be understood (1) of moral alertness (living in faith, love, and hope as vv. 6, 8 call for, versus being unresponsive to God) or (2) of physical life and death (whether alive or dead). The first fits better with the context of 5:1-9, while the second returns to the point Paul started with in 4:13-18 (no disadvantage for the believing dead).<br>
