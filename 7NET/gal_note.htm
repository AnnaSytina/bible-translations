Thus, the text reading is more widespread geographically and is found in the two earliest witnesses, along with several good representatives of the Alexandrian, Western, and Byzantine texttypes. Internally, there would be a strong motivation for scribes to change the order: "from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" is Paul's normal greeting; here alone is the pronoun attached to "Jesus Christ." Intrinsically, as well, the chosen reading is superior: scribes would be prone to emulate Paul's regular style, while in an early letter such as this one his regular style was yet to be established (for a similar situation, cf. the text-critical discussion at 1 Thess 1:1). Hence, there is a strong probability that the reading in the translation is authentic.<br>

 <a name="fn17" href="gal.htm#fnB17"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  Traditionally, "servant" or "bondservant." Though <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dou'lo"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">doulos</FONT>) is normally translated "servant," the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BAGD notes that "`servant' for `slave' is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times...in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished" (BAGD 205 s.v.). The most accurate translation is "bondservant" (sometimes found in the ASV for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dou'lo"</FONT>), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:10)  Undoubtedly the background for the concept of being the Lord's slave or servant is to be found in the Old Testament scriptures. For a Jew this concept did not connote drudgery, but honor and privilege. It was used of national Israel at times (Isa 43:10), but was especially associated with famous OT personalities, including such great men as Moses (Joshua 14:7), David (Ps 89:3; cf. 2 Sam 7:5, 8) and Elijah (2 Kings 10:10); all these men were "servants (or slaves) of the Lord."<br>

 <a name="fn23" href="gal.htm#fnB23"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:12)  It is difficult to determine what kind of genitive <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">*Ihsou' Cristou'</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Ihsou Cristou</FONT>) is. If it is a subjective genitive, the meaning is "a revelation from Jesus Christ" but if objective genitive, it is "a revelation about Jesus Christ." Most likely this is objective since the explanation in vv. 15-16 mentions God revealing the Son to Paul so that he might preach, although the idea of a direct revelation to Paul at some point cannot be ruled out.<br>

There is hardly any reason why scribes would omit the words (although the Beatty papyrus and the Western text do occasionally omit words and phrases), but several reasons why scribes would add the words (especially the need to clarify).

Though traditionally translated "faith in (Jesus) Christ," an increasing number of New Testament scholars are arguing that <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pivsti" Cristou'</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">pisti" Cristou</FONT>) and similar phrases in Paul (Rom 3:22, 26; Gal 2:16, 20; 3:22; Phil 3:9) involves a <i>subjective</i> genitive and means "Christ's faith" or "Christ's faithfulness" (cf., e.g., G.

Hooker, "<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Pivsti" Cristou'</FONT>," <i>NTS</i> 35 (1989): 321-42). Noteworthy among the arguments for the subjective genitive view is that when <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pivsti" </FONT>takes a personal genitive it is almost never an objective genitive (cf. Matt 9:2, 22, 29; Mark 2:5; 5:34; 10:52; Luke 5:20; 7:50; 8:25, 48; 17:19; 18:42; 22:32; Rom 1:8; 12; 3:3; 4:5, 12, 16; 1 Cor 2:5; 15:14, 17; 2 Cor 10:15; Phil 2:17; Col 1:4; 2:5; 1 Thess 1:8; 3:2, 5, 10; 2 Thess 1:3; Titus 1:1; Phlm 6; 1 Pet 1:9, 21; 2 Pet 1:5). <br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:22)  On the phrase <i>because of the faithfulness of Jesus Christ </i>D. B.

The present participle of course allows for such options, but also allows for <i>contemporaneous</i> ("while being confined") and <i>result</i> ("with the result that we were confined"). Externally, the perfect participle has little to commend it, being restricted for the most part to later and Byzantine witnesses.<br>

The punctuation of vv. 25, 26, and 27 is difficult to represent because of the causal connections between each verse. English style would normally require a comma either at the end of v. 25 or v. 26, but in so doing the translation would then link v. 26 almost exclusively with either v. 25 or v. 27; this would be problematic as scholars debate which two verses are to be linked. Because of this, the translation instead places a period at the end of each verse. This preserves some of the ambiguity inherent in the Greek and does not exclude any particular causal connection.<br>

It does strongly suggest, however, that Paul's adversaries in this case (<i>those agitators</i>) were men. Some interpreters (notably Erasmus and the Reformers) have attempted to soften the meaning to a figurative "separate themselves" (meaning the opponents would withdraw from fellowship) but such an understanding dramatically weakens the rhetorical force of Paul's argument. Although it has been argued that such an act of emasculation would be unthinkable for Paul, it must be noted that Paul's statement is one of biting sarcasm, obviously not meant to be taken literally.
