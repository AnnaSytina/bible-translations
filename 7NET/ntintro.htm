<p>The task of Bible translation is a daunting one. No translation is perfect, and the present one is no exception. Nevertheless the translators have attempted, as far as possible, to give an accurate rendition of the Greek text of the New Testament into modern English. The following points relate specifically to the NET Bible New Testament 1.0.<A name="_Toc416893761"></A><A name="_Toc430248858"></A></p>
<i><i>The Greek Text Behind the NET New Testament </i></i>
<p>As for the Greek text used in the NET New Testament 1.0, an eclectic text was followed, differing in a number of places from the standard critical text as represented by the Nestle-Aland 27th edition and the United Bible Societies' 4th edition. The translators who prepared the initial drafts of individual New Testament books made preliminary decisions regarding textual variants, and these were then checked and discussed by editors and a textual consultant. Where there are significant variant readings, these are normally indicated in a text critical note [<b>tc</b>], along with a few of the principal witnesses (manuscripts) supporting the variants. While this listing of manuscript evidence is not intended to be exhaustive, readers familiar with the major witnesses will find this feature useful in making brief evaluations for themselves, sometimes with the aid of the textual apparatus in a standard critical edition of the Greek New Testament.<A name="_Toc416893762"></A><A name="_Toc430248859"></A></p>
<i><i>Arrangement of the New Testament Text </i></i>
<p>Divisions in the New Testament text like chapters, paragraphs, and verses were added later<A name="fnB0" href="#fn0" class="BQNote">[1]</A> in the process of handing the text down from one generation to the next. Verse divisions were added to the New Testament, for example, in 1551. They are not part of the original documents, and in many cases give the appearance of being rather arbitrary. However, they have become accepted over time, and are useful to students of the Bible as &#147;aids to navigation&#148; when reading through or referring to the text. The text of the New Testament itself has been arranged in paragraphs determined by the translators and editors. In almost all cases the verse divisions follow standard English practice, and in the few instances where there is a difference between the versification of the standard critical editions of the Greek New Testament and most English versions<A name="fnB1" href="#fn1" class="BQNote">[2]</A> this is indicated by a translator&#146;s note [<b>tn</b>].<p>
As a further aid to readers and students of the Bible, descriptive sectional headings are given in italics. These were determined by the translators and editors in an attempt to be as helpful as possible, but should not be viewed as an integral part of the NET Bible text.<p>
Earlier printed editions of the Bible (the King James Version of 1611, for example) did not use quotation marks. Modern readers have come to expect them, however, so the NET Bible follows standard conventions of setting direct quotations with various combinations of single and double quotation marks.<p>
New Testament quotations from the Old Testament are indicated by a combination of <b><i>boldface and italic</i></b> type. Less direct allusions to Old Testament passages are indicated by <i>italic</i> type only. In both cases a study note [<b>sn</b>] gives the Old Testament reference.<A name="_Toc416893763"></A><A name="_Toc430248860"></A></p>
<i><i>Further Remarks About the Notes in the NET Bible New Testament</i></i>
<p>One of the unique opportunities offered by electronic media is the inclusion of notes to accompany the translation. The notes offer the translator the opportunity to explain and justify the translation where necessary. Although the NET Bible will be available in printed editions as well, many of the original considerations in designing the format for the notes related to electronic media. No Bible yet published has included notes produced as an integral part of the translation process in as much depth and detail as the notes that accompany the NET Bible. One of the goals of the NET Bible New Testament with the complete set of translator&#146;s footnotes<i> </i>is to allow the general public, as well as Bible students, pastors, missionaries, and Bible translators in the field, to be able to know what the translators of the NET Bible were thinking when a passage or verse was rendered in a particular way. Many times the translator will have made informed decisions based on facts about Greek grammar, syntax, or historical background information not readily available to English speaking students of the Bible.<A name="_Toc416893764"></A><A name="_Toc430248861"></A></p>
<i><i>Types of Notes in the NET Bible New Testament</i></i>
<p>There are three basic kinds of notes employed in the NET Bible, &#147;textual critical notes&#148; [<b>tc</b>], &#147;translator&#146;s notes&#148; [<b>tn</b>], and &#147;study notes&#148; [<b>sn</b>]. In version 1.0 of the NET Bible New Testament the &#147;translator&#146;s notes&#148; are generally more numerous and considerably more technical in nature than the &#147;study notes&#148; (although the latter will continue to be expanded and developed in future editions of the NET Bible).<p>
The &#147;text critical notes&#148; [<b>tc</b>] discuss alternate (variant) readings found in the various manuscripts and groups of manuscripts of the New Testament. In cases where the translation follows a different reading than that found in the standard critical editions of the NT (NA27 and UBS4) a &#147;text critical note&#148; explains the major options and defends the reading followed in the translation. In some other selected cases (such as the longer ending of Mark or the inclusion of John
<bqverse 53>53 -
<bqverse 11>11 ) a &#147;text critical note&#148; explains the issues involved even when the translation follows the same reading found in the standard critical editions.<p>
The &#147;translator&#146;s notes&#148; [<b>tn</b>] are the most numerous. They explain the rationale for the translation and give alternative translations, interpretive options, and other technical information. &#147;Translator&#146;s notes&#148; generally fall into the following categories:</p>
<br>
<li>	Notes introduced by &#147;Or&#148; need no further explanation; they introduce alternative translations that (unless accompanied by additional discussion in the note) are regarded by the translators and editors as more or less equal alternatives to the translation used in the text, with the choice between them made for reasons of style, euphony, or other characteristics of modern English usage.
<li>	Notes introduced by &#147;<i>Grk</i>&#148; give a translation that approximates formal equivalence to the Greek text. This translation was not employed, however, because it was inconsistent with modern English style or could possibly be misunderstood by the modern reader.
<li>	Translator&#146;s notes are also used to indicate major grammatical, syntactical, and exegetical options for a given passage. In such cases the form of the note may vary, but in general the major options will be listed and in most cases a brief evaluation is included in the note. Standard reference materials and, on occasion, relevant periodical literature are frequently mentioned in the notes. Abbreviations for these materials, as well as abbreviations for both biblical books and nonbiblical literature, generally follow the standard abbreviations established by the Society of Biblical Literature (SBL) and employed in its <i>Journal of Biblical Literature</i>.
<li>	In some cases where a rather lengthy note occurs on multiple occasions within the same book, the note will be given in full only on its first occurrence in the book, while succeeding repetitions of the note within the same chapter will refer back to the first occurrence by phrase and verse. This is intended to conserve space by avoiding excessive repetition of identical notes within the same book.</ul><p>The &#147;study notes&#148; [<b>sn</b>] are the other major category of notes occurring in the NET Bible. These are explanatory notes intended for the non-specialist engaged in the reading or study of the Bible. This category includes comments about historical or cultural background, explanation of obscure phrases or brief discussions of context, discussions of the theological point made by the biblical author, cross references and references to Old Testament quotations or allusions in the New Testament, or other miscellaneous information helpful to the modern reader.<p>
It is our prayer and sincere desire that the NET Bible New Testament may enhance and encourage your own personal study of the Bible.</p>

 Chapter divisions in the New Testament date back to codex Vaticanus (B) in the fourth century. The first edition of the New Testament to be divided into verses was the fourth edition of Robertus Stephanus published in 1551. One of the first translations to be divided into paragraphs (as opposed to the individual verses of the King James Version) was the American Standard Version (1901).<br>
<A name="fn1" href="#fnB1" class="BQNote">[2]</A> For example, both the NA27 and UBS4 editions of the Greek text (along with the NRSV, which generally follows the versification of the critical editions of the Greek text in the New Testament) place the familiar phrase &#147;I have been crucified with Christ&#148; at the end of Gal
<bqverse 19>19 , while most other English versions place these words in Gal
<bqverse 20>20 . This is explained in a note in the NET Bible.
