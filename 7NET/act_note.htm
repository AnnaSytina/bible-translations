 <b>tn</b> (1:1)  Or "produced," <i>Grk</i> "made."<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="act.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  Or "first." The translation "former" is preferred because "first" could imply to the modern English reader that the author means that his previous account was the first one to be written down. The Greek term <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">prw'to"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">prwtos</FONT>) does not necessarily mean "first" in an absolute sense, but can refer to the first in a set or series. That is what is intended here--the first account (known as the Gospel of Luke) as compared to the second one (known as Acts).<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="act.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  The Greek word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">lovgo"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">logos</FONT>) is sometimes translated "book" (NRSV, NIV) or "treatise" (KJV). A formal, systematic treatment of a subject is implied, but the word "book" may be too specific and slightly misleading to the modern reader, so "account" has been used.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:1)  <i>The former account</i> refers to the Gospel of Luke, which was "volume one" of the two-volume work Luke-Acts.<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="act.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Grk</i> "O Theophilus," but the usage of the vocative in Acts with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">w\</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">w</FONT>) is unemphatic, following more the classical idiom (see D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax</i>, 69).<br>
 <a name="fn4" href="act.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  The words "to heaven" are not in the Greek text, but are supplied from v. 11. Several modern translations (NIV, NRSV) supply the words "to heaven" after "taken up" to specify the destination explicitly mentioned later in 1:11.<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="act.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  Or "commands." Although some modern translations render <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejnteilavmeno"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">enteilameno"</FONT>) as "instructions" (NIV, NRSV), the word implies authority or official sanction (G. Schrenk, <i>TDNT</i> 2:545), so that a word like "orders" conveys the idea more effectively. The action of the temporal participle is antecedent (prior) to the action of the verb it modifies ("taken up").<br>
 <a name="fn6" href="act.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  Or "through."<br>
 <a name="fn7" href="act.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  <i>Grk</i> "to them"; the referent (the apostles) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="act.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:3)  <i>After his suffering</i> is a reference to Jesus' crucifixion and the abuse which preceded it.<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="act.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  <i>Grk</i> "during forty days." The phrase "over a forty-day period" is used rather than "during forty days" because (as the other NT accounts of Jesus' appearances make clear) Jesus was not continually visible to the apostles during the forty days, but appeared to them on various occasions.<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="act.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  Or "While he was assembling with them," or "while he was sharing a meal with them." There are three basic options for translating the verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">sunalivzw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">sunalizw</FONT>): (1) "<i>Eat</i> (salt) <i>with</i>, <i>share a meal with</i>"; (2) "<i>bring together with, assemble with</i>"; (3) "<i>spend the night with, stay with</i>" (BAGD 783-4 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">sunalivzw</FONT>). The difficulty with (1) is that it does not fit the context, and this meaning is not found elsewhere. (2) is difficult because of the singular number and the present tense. (3) is based on a spelling variation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">sunaulizovmeno"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">sunaulizomeno"</FONT>), which some minuscules actually read here. The difference in meaning between (2) and (3) is not great, but (3) seems to fit the context somewhat better here.<br>
 <a name="fn11" href="act.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  <i>Grk </i>"ordered them"; the command "Do not leave" is not in Greek but is an indirect quotation in the original (see note at end of the verse for explanation).<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="act.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  The word "there" is not in the Greek text (direct objects in Greek were frequently omitted when clear from the context).<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="act.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  <i>Grk</i> "the," with the article used as a possessive pronoun (D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax</i>, 215).<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="act.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  <i>Grk</i> "for the promise of the Father." Jesus is referring to the promised gift of the Holy Spirit (see the following verse).<br>
 <a name="fn15" href="act.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:4)  <i>Grk </i>"While he was with them, he ordered them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for `what my Father promised, which you heard about from me.'" This verse moves from indirect to direct discourse. This abrupt change is very awkward, so the entire quotation has been rendered as direct in the translation. <br>
 <a name="fn16" href="act.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  In the Greek text v. 5 is a continuation of the previous sentence, which is long and complicated. In keeping with the tendency of contemporary English to use shorter sentences, a new sentence was started here in the translation.<br>
 <a name="fn17" href="act.htm#fnB17"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  The pronoun is plural in Greek.<br>
 <a name="fn18" href="act.htm#fnB18"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:6)  <i>Grk</i> "they began to ask him, saying." The participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">levgonte"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">legontes</FONT>) is redundant in contemporary English and has not been translated. The imperfect tense of the Greek verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hjrwvtwn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">hrwtwn</FONT>) is best translated as an ingressive imperfect.<br>
 <a name="fn19" href="act.htm#fnB19"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  <i>Grk</i> "It is not for you to know."<br>
 <a name="fn20" href="act.htm#fnB20"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:8)  Or "to the ends."<br>
 <a name="fn21" href="act.htm#fnB21"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:9)  <i>Grk</i> "And after." Because of the difference between Greek style, which often begins sentences or clauses with "and," and English style, which generally does not, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>) is not translated here.<br>
 <a name="fn22" href="act.htm#fnB22"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  <i>Grk</i> "And as."

 <a name="fn24" href="act.htm#fnB24"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  The word "here" is not in the Greek text, but is implied. Direct objects were frequently omitted in Greek when clear from the context, but must be supplied for the modern English reader.<br>
 <a name="fn25" href="act.htm#fnB25"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  Or "into the sky." The Greek word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oujranov"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ouranos</FONT>) may be translated "sky" (vv. 10, 11a) or "heaven" (twice in v. 11b) depending on the context.<br>
 <a name="fn26" href="act.htm#fnB26"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:12)  Or "from the hill." The Greek term <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">o[ro"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">oros</FONT>) refers to a relatively high elevation of land in contrast with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">bounov"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">bounos</FONT>, "hill").<br>
 <a name="fn27" href="act.htm#fnB27"><sup>28</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:12)  The <i>Mount of Olives </i>is the traditional name for this mountain, also called Olivet. The <i>Mount of Olives</i> is really a ridge running north to south about 1.8 mi (3 km) long, east of Jerusalem across the Kidron Valley. Its central elevation is about 100 ft (30 m) higher than Jerusalem. It was named for the large number of olive trees which grew on it.<br>
 <a name="fn28" href="act.htm#fnB28"><sup>29</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:12)  The phrase <i>a Sabbath day</i>'<i>s journey </i>refers to the distance the rabbis permitted a person to travel on the Sabbath without breaking the Sabbath, specified in tractate <i>Sotah</i> 5:3 of the Mishnah as 2,000 cubits (a cubit was about 18 inches). In this case the distance was about half a mile (1 km).<br>
 <a name="fn29" href="act.htm#fnB29"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13)  <i>Grk</i> "And when." Because of the difference between Greek style, which often begins sentences or clauses with "and," and English style, which generally does not, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>) is not translated here.<br>
 <a name="fn30" href="act.htm#fnB30"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:13)  The word "Jerusalem" is not in the Greek text but is implied (direct objects were often omitted when clear from the context).<br>

 <a name="fn36" href="act.htm#fnB36"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:16)  In light of the compound phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">a[ndre" ajdelfoiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">andre" adelfoi</FONT>, "Men brothers") Peter's words are probably to be seen as directly addressed to the males present, possibly limited to those of the twelve (really ten at this point--eleven minus the speaker, Peter) mentioned by name in Acts 1:13.<br>

Here it is possible (and indeed necessary) to translate <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejgevneto</FONT> as "came" so that the initial clause of the English translation contains a verb; nevertheless the translation of the conjunction <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> is not necessary.<br>

The precise meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">diamerivzomai</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">diamerizomai</FONT>) in Acts 2:3 is difficult to determine. The meaning could be "tongues as of fire dividing up one to each person," but it is also possible that the individual tongues of fire were divided ("And divided tongues as of fire appeared"). The translation adopted in the text ("tongues spreading out like a fire") attempts to be somewhat ambiguous.<br>

It is possible that only men are in view here in light of OT commands for Jewish men to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem at various times during the year (cf. Exod 23:17, 34:23; Deut 16:16). However, other evidence seems to indicate that both men and women might be in view. Luke 2:41-52 shows that whole families would make the temporary trip to Jerusalem. In addition, it is probable that the audience consisted of families who had taken up permanent residence in Jerusalem. The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">katoikevw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">katoikew</FONT>) normally means "reside" or "dwell," and archeological evidence from tombs in Jerusalem does indicate that many families immigrated to Jerusalem permanently (see B. Witherington, <i>Acts</i>, 135); this would naturally include women. Also, the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajnhvr</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ajnhr</FONT>), which usually does mean "male" or "man" (as opposed to woman), sometimes is used generically to mean "a person" (BAGD 66 s.v. 1, 6; cf.

BAGD notes that "`servant' for `slave' is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times...in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished" (BAGD 205 s.v.). The most accurate translation is "bondservant" (sometimes found in the ASV for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dou'lo"</FONT>), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another.

 <b>sn</b> (2:31)  The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">cristov"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">cristos</FONT>) was originally an adjective ("anointed"), developing in LXX into a substantive ("an anointed one"), then developing still further into a technical generic term ("the anointed one"). In the intertestamental period it developed further into a technical term referring to the hoped-for anointed one, that is, a specific individual. In the NT the development starts there (technical-specific), is so used in the gospels, and then develops in Paul to mean virtually Jesus' last name.<br>
 <a name="fn118" href="act.htm#fnB118"><sup>58</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:31)  Or "abandoned in the world of the dead." The translation "world of the dead" for Hades is suggested by L&amp;N 1.19. The phrase is an allusion to Ps 16:10.<br>

 <a name="fn139" href="act.htm#fnB139"><sup>79</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:38) There is debate over the meaning of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij" </FONT>in the prepositional phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij" a[fesin tw'n aJmartiw'n uJmw'n </FONT>(<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">eis afesin twn Jamartiwn Jumwn</FONT>, "for/because of/with reference to the forgiveness of your sins"). Although a "causal" sense has been argued, it is difficult to maintain. D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax</i>, 369-71, discusses at least four other ways of dealing with the passage: (1) The baptism referred to here is physical only, and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij" </FONT>has the meaning of "for" or "unto." Such a view suggests that salvation is based on works--an idea that runs counter to the theology of Acts, namely: (a) repentance often precedes baptism (cf. Acts 3:19; 26:20), and (b) salvation is entirely a gift of God, not procured via water baptism (Acts 10:43 [cf. v. 47]; 13:38-39, 48; 15:11; 16:30-31; 20:21; 26:18); (2) The baptism referred to here is spiritual only. Although such a view fits well with the theology of Acts, it does not fit well with the obvious meaning of "baptism" in Acts--especially in this text (cf. 2:41); (3) The text should be repunctuated in light of the shift from second person plural to third person singular back to second person plural again. The idea then would be, "Repent <i>for/with reference to </i>your sins, and let each one of you be baptized..." Such a view is an acceptable way of handling <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij"</FONT>, but its subtlety and awkwardness are against it; (4) Finally, it is possible that to a first-century Jewish audience (as well as to Peter), the idea of baptism might incorporate both the spiritual reality and the physical symbol<i>. </i>That Peter connects both closely in his thinking is clear from other passages such as Acts 10:47 and 11:15-16. If this interpretation is correct, then Acts 2:38 is saying very little about the specific theological relationship between the symbol and the reality, only that historically they were viewed together. One must look in other places for a theological analysis. For further discussion see R. N. Longenecker, "Acts," <i>EBC</i> 9:283-85; B. Witherington, <i>Acts</i>, 154-55; F. F.

 <b>sn</b> (3:25)  <i>In your descendants </i>(<i>Grk</i> "in your seed"). <i>Seed</i> has an important ambiguity in this verse.

 <a name="fn718" href="act.htm#fnB718"><sup>78</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:27)  The term <i>eunuch </i>normally referred to a man who had been castrated, but this was not always the case (Gen 39:1 LXX). Such castrated individuals were preferred as court officials in the East, although Judaism opposed the practice. The Mosaic law excluded eunuchs from Israel (Deut 23:1), although God certainly accepted them (Isa 56:3-5; Wis 3:14). This individual was a high official, since he was said to be <i>in charge of all her treasury</i>. He may or may not have been a eunuch physically. He appears to be the first fully Gentile convert to Christianity, since the Samaritans mentioned previously (Acts 8:4-25) were regarded as half-breeds.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (8:27)  <i>Candace</i> was the title of the queen of the Ethiopians. <i>Ethiopia</i> refers to the kingdom of Nubia in the northern Sudan, whose capital was Meroe (not to be confused with Abyssinia, which was later called Ethiopia and converted to Christianity in the 4th century A.D.). Classical writers refer to several queens of Meroe in the 1st century B.C. and 1st century A.D. who had the title Candace (<i>Kandake</i>). The Candace referred to here was probably Amantitere, who ruled A.D. 25-41.<br>

 <a name="fn871" href="act.htm#fnB871"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:1)  <i>A centurion</i> was a noncommissioned officer in the Roman army or one of the auxiliary territorial armies, commanding a <i>centuria</i> of (nominally) 100 men. The responsibilities of centurions were broadly similar to modern junior officers, but there was a wide gap in social status between them and officers, and relatively few were promoted beyond the rank of senior centurion. The Roman troops stationed in Judea were auxiliaries, who would normally be rewarded with Roman citizenship after 25 years of service. Some of the centurions may have served originally in the Roman legions (regular army) and thus gained their citizenship at enlistment. Others may have inherited it, like Paul.<br>

The underlying Hebrew idiom includes the personal element ("respecter of persons") so the phrase "in dealing with people" is included in the present translation.

 <a name="fn1003" href="act.htm#fnB1003"><sup>134</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:48)  The Greek construction (passive infinitive with accusative subject) could be translated either "he ordered them to be baptized" or "he ordered that they be baptized," but the implication in English in either case is that Peter was giving orders to the Gentiles in Cornelius' house, telling them to get baptized. It is much more likely in the context that Peter was ordering those Jewish Christians who accompanied him to baptize the new Gentile converts. They would doubtless have still had misgivings even after witnessing the outpouring of the Spirit and hearing the tongues.

In this context, however, where "creeping things" are contrasted with "four-footed animals," the English word "reptiles," which primarily but not exclusively designates snakes, is probably more appropriate.<br>

As in the OT, this phrase focuses on the prophetic nature and divine origin of what has been said.<br>

 <a name="fn1033" href="act.htm#fnB1033"><sup>29</sup></a><b>sn</b> (11:17)  That is, the <i>same gift</i> of the Holy Spirit.<br>
 <a name="fn1034" href="act.htm#fnB1034"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:17)  Or "gave us when we believed"; or "gave us after we believed"; or "gave us who believed"; or "gave them when they believed the same gift as he also gave us." The aorist dative plural participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pisteuvsasin</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">pisteusasin</FONT>) can be understood in several different ways: (1) It could modify <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJmi'n</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jhmin</FONT>, "us") or <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aujtoi'"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">autois</FONT>, "them"). Proximity (it immediately follows <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJmi'n</FONT>) would suggest that it belongs with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJmi'n</FONT>, so the last option ("gave them when they believed the same gift he also gave us") is less likely. (2) The participle could be either circumstantial or adjectival, modifying <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJmi'n</FONT>. This decision is primarily a contextual one. The point Peter made is not whether or not the Gentiles believed, since both groups ("us" and "they") had believed in the Lord Jesus Christ. The point was whether or not the Gentiles received the Spirit when they believed, just as Jewish Christians had received the Spirit on the day of Pentecost when they believed. Translated as an adjectival participle, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pisteuvsasin</FONT> only affirms the fact of belief, however, and raises somewhat of a theological problem if one realizes, "Would God have given the Gentiles the Spirit if they had <i>not</i> believed?" (In other words, belief in itself is a theological prerequisite for receiving the Spirit. As such, in the case of the Gentiles, it is <i>assumed.</i>) Thus in context it makes more sense to understand the participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pisteuvsasin</FONT> as circumstantial, related to the <i>time</i> of belief in connection with the giving of the Spirit. (3) The participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pisteuvsasin</FONT> as a temporal participle can refer to action <i>antecedent</i> to the action of the main verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">e[dwken</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">edwken</FONT>) or <i>contemporaneous</i> with it. Logically, at least, the gift of the Spirit <i>followed</i> belief in the case of the original Christians, who had believed before the day of Pentecost. In the case of Cornelius and his household, belief and the reception of the Spirit were virtually simultaneous. One can argue that Peter is "summarizing" the experience of Jewish Christians, and therefore the actions of belief and reception of the Spirit, while historically separate, have been "telescoped" into one ("gave them the same gift as he gave us when we believed"), but to be technically accurate the participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pisteuvsasin</FONT> should be translated "gave them the same gift as he also gave us after we believed." A number of these problems can be avoided, however, by using a translation in English that maintains some of the ambiguity of the Greek original. Thus "if God gave them the same gift as he also gave us after believing" is used, where the phrase "after believing" can refer either to "them" or to "us," or both.<br>

Since Herod has been the subject of the preceding material, and the circumstances of his death are the subject of the following verses (20-23), it is best to understand Herod as the subject here. This is especially true since according to Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 19.8.2 [19.343-52], Herod Agrippa I died at Caesarea in A.D. 44, and vv. 20-23 here describe his death. Thus the end of v. 19 provides Luke's transition to explain how Herod got from Jerusalem to Caesarea where he died. In spite of all this evidence, the NRSV translates this phrase "Then Peter went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there," understanding the referent to be Peter rather than Herod Agrippa I.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (12:19)  <i>King Herod</i> was Herod Agrippa I, the grandson of Herod I (Herod the Great), who died at Caesarea in A.D. 44 according to Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 19.8.2 [19.343-52].<br>

This individual was not just a domestic servant or butler, but a highly respected person who had considerable responsibility for the king's living quarters and personal affairs. The English word "chamberlain" corresponds very closely to this meaning but is not in common use today.

The account by Josephus, while not identical to Luke's account, is similar in many respects: On the second day of a festival, Herod Agrippa appeared in the theater with a robe made of silver. When it sparkled in the sun, the people cried out flatteries and declared him to be a god. The king, carried away by the flattery, saw an owl (an omen of death) sitting on a nearby rope, and immediately was struck with severe stomach pains. He was carried off to his house and died five days later. The two accounts can be reconciled without difficulty, since while Luke states that Herod was immediately struck down by an angel, his death could have come several days later. The mention of <i>worms</i> with death adds a humiliating note to the scene. The formerly powerful ruler had been thoroughly reduced to nothing (cf. Jdt 16:17; 2 Macc 9:9; cf. also Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 17.6.5 [17.168-70], which details the sickness which led to Herod the Great's death). <br>

A decision on this problem is very difficult. For several reasons <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij"</FONT> can be preferred. It is the most difficult reading by far in light of the context, since Paul and Barnabas were going to Jerusalem in 11:30. It is found in better witnesses, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> and B being very strong evidence. The other readings, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejx</FONT> and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajpov</FONT>, are different from <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij"</FONT> yet bear essentially the same meaning as each other; this seems to suggest that scribes had problems with <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij"</FONT> and tried to choose an acceptable revision. If <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij" </FONT>is the earliest reading, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajpov </FONT>is a clarification of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejx</FONT>, and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejx</FONT> could have arisen through confusion of letters. Despite this reasoning, however, the case for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij"</FONT> is not airtight; either <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejx</FONT> or <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajpov</FONT> can also be preferred on other lines of reasoning. The reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejx </FONT>enjoys the earliest support, and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij"</FONT> could have arisen through the same confusion of letters mentioned above. The immediate and wider context seems to mitigate against <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij"</FONT> as the original reading: the aorist participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">plhrwvsante" </FONT>seems to signal the end of the mission to Jerusalem with the famine relief, so it would make sense in the context for the team to be coming <i>from</i> Jerusalem (to Antioch) rather than <i>to</i> Jerusalem, and 13:1 certainly presents the scene at Antioch. The later addition <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij" =Antiovceian</FONT> after <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">=Ierousalhvm </FONT>in some MSS seems to be a clarification in light of 13:1 (notice that some of the MSS that read <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejx</FONT> add <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij" =Antiovceian </FONT>[945 1739], and some that read <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajpoV</FONT> also add <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij" =Antiovceian</FONT> [E 1175]). Thus, the idea of spatial separation from Jerusalem is strongly implied by the context. This problem is so difficult that some scholars resort to conjectural emendation to determine the original reading. All in all, the reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij"</FONT> should be preferred as original, recognizing that there is a great degree of uncertainty with this solution.

This was roughly equivalent to being governor of a region. Several times in the NT, Herod tetrarch of Galilee is called a king (Matt 14:9, Mark 6:14-29), reflecting popular usage.<br>
 <a name="fn1179" href="act.htm#fnB1179"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:1)  Or "(a foster brother of Herod the tetrarch)." The meaning "close friend from childhood" is given by L&amp;N 34.15, but the word can also mean "foster brother" (L&amp;N 10.51).<br>
 <a name="fn1180" href="act.htm#fnB1180"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:2)  This term is frequently used in the LXX of the service performed by priests and Levites in the tabernacle (Exod 28:35, 43; 29:30; 30:20; 35:19; 39:26; Num 1:50; 3:6, 31) and the temple (2 Chr 31:2; 35:3; Joel 1:9, 13; 2:17, and many more examples). According to BAGD 470 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">leitourgevw</FONT> 2 it is used "of the various ways in which the religious man serves God." Since the previous verse described the prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch, it is probable that the term here describes two of them (Barnabas and Saul) as they were serving in that capacity. Since they were not in Jerusalem where the temple was located, general religious service is referred to here.<br>

 <a name="fn1339" href="act.htm#fnB1339"><sup>166</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:45)  The imperfect verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajntevlegon</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">antelegon</FONT>) is translated as an ingressive imperfect in the logical sequence of events: after they were filled with jealousy, the Jewish opponents began to contradict what Paul said.<br>

 <a name="fn1341" href="act.htm#fnB1341"><sup>168</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:45)  The participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">blasfhmou'nte"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">blasfhmounte"</FONT>) has been regarded as indicating the means of the action of the main verb. It could also be translated as a finite verb ("and reviled him") in keeping with contemporary English style. The direct object ("him") is implied rather than expressed and could be impersonal ("it," referring to what Paul was saying rather than Paul himself), but the verb occurs more often in contexts involving defamation or slander against personal beings (not always God). For a very similar context to this one, compare Acts 18:6. The translation "blaspheme" is not used because in contemporary English its meaning is more narrowly defined and normally refers to blasphemy against God (not what Paul's opponents were doing here). The modern term "slandering" comes close to what was being done to Paul here.<br>
 <a name="fn1342" href="act.htm#fnB1342"><sup>169</sup></a><b>tn</b> (13:46)  <i>Grk</i> "Both Paul and Barnabas spoke out courageously and said." The redundancy is removed in the translation and the verb "replied" is used in keeping with the logical sequence of events. The theme of boldness reappears: Acts 4:24-30; 9:27-28.<br>

 <a name="fn1506" href="act.htm#fnB1506"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn</b> (15:19)  Or "I have decided," "I think." The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">krivnw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">krinw</FONT>) has a far broader range of meaning than the often-used English verb "judge." BAGD 451 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">krivnw</FONT> 2 places this use in Acts 15:19 in the category "<i>judge, think, consider, look upon</i>" followed by double accusative of object and predicate. However, many modern translations give the impression that a binding decision is being handed down by James: "it is my judgment" (NASB, NIV); "I have reached the decision" (NRSV). L&amp;N 22.25, on the other hand, translate the phrase here "I think that we should not cause extra difficulty for those among the Gentiles." This gives more the impression of an opinion than a binding decision. The resolution of this lies not so much in the lexical data as in how one conceives James' role in the leadership of the Jerusalem church, plus the dynamics of the specific situation where the issue of Gentile inclusion in the church was being discussed. The major possibilities are: (1) James is handing down a binding decision to the rest of the church as the one who has ultimate authority to decide this matter; (2) James is offering his own personal opinion in the matter, which is not binding on the church; (3) James is voicing a consensus opinion of all the apostles and elders, although phrasing it as if it were his own; (4) James is making a suggestion to the rest of the leadership as to what course they should follow. In light of the difficulty in reconstructing the historical situation in detail, it is best to use a translation which maintains as many of the various options as possible. For this reason the translation "Therefore I conclude" has been used, leaving open the question whether in reaching this conclusion James is speaking only for himself or for the rest of the leadership.<br>

Although the Epicureans saw the aim of life as pleasure, they were not strictly hedonists, because they defined pleasure as the absence of pain. Along with this, they desired the avoidance of trouble and freedom from annoyances. They saw organized religion as evil, especially the belief that the gods punished evildoers in an afterlife.

 <b>sn</b> (18:12)  <i>The judgment seat</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">bh'ma</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">bhma</FONT>) was a raised platform mounted by steps and sometimes furnished with a seat, used by officials in addressing an assembly or making pronouncements, often on judicial matters. The judgment seat was a familiar item in Greco-Roman culture, often located in the <i>agora</i>, the public square or marketplace in the center of a city. So this was a very public event.<br>

BAGD 611 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">parav</FONT> III.6 has "adversative <i>against, contrary to</i>" for Acts 18:13. The words "in a way" are not in the Greek text, but are a necessary clarification to prevent the misunderstanding in the English translation that worshiping God was in itself contrary to the law. What is under dispute is the <i>manner</i> in which God was being worshiped, that is, whether Gentiles were being required to follow all aspects of the Mosaic law, including male circumcision. There is a hint of creating public chaos or disturbing Jewish custom here, since Jews were the ones making the complaint. Luke often portrays the dispute between Christians and Jews as within Judaism.<br>

The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajphvlasen</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">aphlasen</FONT>) has been translated as a causative since Gallio probably did not perform this action in person, but ordered his aides or officers to remove the plaintiffs.<br>

The relationship of the participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">keiravmeno"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">keirameno"</FONT>) is difficult to determine. Traditionally it is taken to refer to Paul, meaning that Paul had his hair cut off because of the vow. However, due to the proximity of the noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">*Akuvla"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Akula"</FONT>) and the reversal of the normal order (Aquila and Priscilla, Acts 17:34), the participle is taken as adjectival referring to Aquila by H. Greeven, <i>TDNT</i> 2:777, n. 11. The later references to Paul in Jerusalem (Acts 21:23) do not resolve the problem, because the cutting of Paul's own hair, while it may be implied, is not specifically mentioned in connection with the completion of the vows made by the other four.<br>
 <a name="fn1897" href="act.htm#fnB1897"><sup>67</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:18)  The word "off" is supplied in the translation to indicate that this was not a normal haircut, but the shaving of the head connected with taking the vow (see Acts 21:24).<br>
 <a name="fn1898" href="act.htm#fnB1898"><sup>68</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:18)  That is, "before he sailed from Cenchrea."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (18:18)  <i>Cenchrea</i> was one of the seaports for the city of Corinth, on the eastern side of the Isthmus of Corinth, on the Aegean Sea. It was 7 mi (11 km) east of Corinth.<br>
 <a name="fn1899" href="act.htm#fnB1899"><sup>69</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:18)  <i>He had made a vow.</i> It is debated whether this vow is a private vow of thanksgiving or the Nazirite vow, because it is not clear whether the Nazirite vow could be taken outside Jerusalem. Some have cited the Mishnah (<i>m. Nazir</i> 3:6, 5:4) to argue that the shaving of the hair can occur outside Jerusalem, and Josephus, <i>J. W.</i> 2.15.1 (2.313) is sometimes suggested as a parallel, but these references are not clear. H. Greeven, <i>TDNT</i> 2:777, is certain that this refers to the Nazirite vow. Regardless, it is clear that Paul reflected his pious dependence on God.<br>
 <a name="fn1900" href="act.htm#fnB1900"><sup>70</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:19)  <i>Ephesus</i> was an influential city in Asia Minor. It was the location of the famous temple of Artemis. In 334 B.C. control of the city had passed to Alexander the Great, who contributed a large sum to the building of a new and more elaborate temple of Artemis, which became one of the seven wonders of the ancient world and lasted until destroyed by the Goths in A.D. 263. This major port city would be reached from Corinth by ship. It was 250 mi (400 km) east of Corinth by sea.<br>

 <a name="fn1905" href="act.htm#fnB1905"><sup>75</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:19)  Although the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dielevgeto</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">dielegeto</FONT>) is frequently translated "reasoned," "disputed," or "argued," this sense comes from its classical meaning where it was used of philosophical disputation, including the Socratic method of questions and answers. However, there does not seem to be contextual evidence for this kind of debate in Acts 18:19. As G. Schrenk (<i>TDNT</i> 2:94-95) points out, "What is at issue is the address which any qualified member of a synagogue might give." Other examples of this may be found in the NT in Matt 4:23 and Mark 1:21. While it is also possible to translate <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dielevgeto</FONT> as "was preaching" here (BAGD 185 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dialevgomai</FONT> 2), the verb "preach" in contemporary English is more connected with Christian contexts than Jewish ones.<br>
 <a name="fn1906" href="act.htm#fnB1906"><sup>76</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:20)  <i>He would not consent.</i> Paul probably refused because he wanted to reach Jerusalem for the festival season before the seas became impassable during the winter.<br>

The participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eijpwvn</FONT> has been translated as a finite verb due to requirements of contemporary English style.<br>
 <a name="fn1909" href="act.htm#fnB1909"><sup>79</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:21)  Or "will return."<br>

Again Paul acts in dependence on God.<br>
 <a name="fn1911" href="act.htm#fnB1911"><sup>81</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:21)  A new sentence was begun here in the translation due to the length of the sentence in Greek and the requirements of contemporary English style, which generally uses shorter sentences.<br>

 <a name="fn1915" href="act.htm#fnB1915"><sup>85</sup></a><b>tn</b> (18:22)  The words "at Jerusalem" are not in the Greek text, but are implied by the participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajnabav"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">anabas</FONT>). The expression "go up" refers almost exclusively to the direction of Jerusalem, while the corresponding "go down" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">katevbh</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">katebh</FONT>) refers to directions away from Jerusalem. Both expressions are based on a Hebrew idiom. Assuming Jerusalem is meant, this is another indication of keeping that key church informed. If Jerusalem is not referred to here, then Caesarea is in view. Paul was trying to honor a vow, which also implies a visit to Jerusalem.<br>
 <a name="fn1916" href="act.htm#fnB1916"><sup>86</sup></a><b>sn</b> (18:22)  <i>Went down to Antioch.</i> The city of <i>Antioch</i> in Syria lies due north of Jerusalem. In Western languages it is common to speak of north as "up" and south as "down," but the NT maintains the Hebrew idiom which speaks of <i>any</i> direction away from Jerusalem as down (since Mount Zion was thought of in terms of altitude). This marks the end of the second missionary journey which began in Acts 15:36. From Caesarea to Antioch is a journey of 280 mi (450 km).<br>

In this verse <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">lovgio"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">logios</FONT>) can refer to someone who was an attractive and convincing speaker, a rhetorician (L&amp;N 33.32), or it can refer to the person who has acquired a large part of the intellectual heritage of a given culture ("learned" or "cultured," L&amp;N 27.20, see also BAGD 476 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">lovgio"</FONT> 1, 2 which lists both meanings as possible here). The description of Apollos' fervent speaking in the following verses, as well as implications from 1 Cor 1-4, where Paul apparently compares his style and speaking ability with that of Apollos, suggests that eloquent speaking ability or formal rhetorical skill are in view here. This clause has been moved from its order in the Greek text (<i>Grk</i> "a certain Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, an eloquent speaker, arrived in Ephesus, who was powerful in the scriptures") and paired with the last element ("powerful in the scriptures") due to the demands of clarity and contemporary English style.<br>

However, this is lengthy and somewhat awkward in English, and the ascensive meaning can be much more easily represented by including the word "even" after the negation. Apparently these disciples were unaware of the provision of the Spirit that is represented in baptism. The language sounds like they did not know about a Holy Spirit, but this seems to be only linguistic shorthand for not knowing about the Spirit's presence (Luke 3:15-18). The situation is parallel to that of Apollos. Apollos and these disciples represent those who "complete" their transition to messianic faith as Jews.<br>

The <i>Syrtis </i>here is the so-called Great Syrtis, toward Cyrenaica. It had a horrible reputation as a sailors' graveyard (Pliny, <i>Natural History</i> 5.26). Josephus (<i>J.

In spite of this L&amp;N 6.1 states, "In Ac 27:17, for example, the reference of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">skeu'o"</FONT> is generally understood to be the mainsail." A reference to the sail is highly unlikely because in a storm of the force described in Ac 27:14, the sail would have been taken down and reefed immediately, to prevent its being ripped to shreds or torn away by the gale.<br>
