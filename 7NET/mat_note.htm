 <b>tn</b> (1:1)  <i>Grk </i>"the book of the genealogy." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">bivblo"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">biblo"</FONT>), though it is without the article, is to be translated as definite due to Apollonius' corollary and the normal use of anarthrous nouns in titles.<br>

 <a name="fn2" href="mat.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:6)  <i>By the wife of Uriah</i>, i.e., Bathsheba (cf. 2 Sam 11:3).<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="mat.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:7)  The reading "Asaph" is found in the earliest and most widespread witnesses (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>1<sup>vid</sup> <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> B C D<sup>luc</sup> <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Euml;</FONT><sup>1</sup> <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Euml;</FONT><sup>13</sup> 700 <i>et pauci</i>), a variant spelling on <i>Asa</i>. Although Asaph was a psalmist and Asa was a king, it is doubtful that the author mistook one for the other, since other ancient documents have variant spellings on the king's name (such as "Asab," "Asanos," and "Asaph").<br>
 <a name="fn4" href="mat.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:10)  "Amos" is the reading found in the earliest and best witnesses, and as such is most likely original, but this is a variant spelling of the name "Amon." The translation uses the more well-known spelling "Amon" found in the Hebrew MT and the majority of LXX MSS. See also the textual discussion of "Asa"<i> </i>versus "Asaph" (vv. 7-8); the situation is similar.<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="mat.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:11)  Before the mention of <i>Jeconiah</i>, several medieval MSS add Jehoiakim, in conformity with the genealogy in 1 Chr 3:15-16. But this alters the count of fourteen generations (v. 17). It is evident that the author is selective in his genealogy for a theological purpose.<br>
 <a name="fn6" href="mat.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:12)  Because of the difference between Greek style, which usually begins a sentence with a conjunction, and English style, which generally does not, the conjunction <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dev</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">de</FONT>) is not translated here.<br>
 <a name="fn7" href="mat.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:12)  The Greek text and the KJV read <i>Salathiel.</i> Most modern English translations use the OT form of the name (cf. Ezra 3:2).<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="mat.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:16)  The pronoun <i>whom </i>is feminine gender in the Greek text, referring to Mary. The Sinaitic Syriac MS alone alters the text of v. 16 to indicate that Joseph was the natural father of Jesus ("Joseph, to whom was betrothed Mary the virgin, fathered Jesus who is called the Christ"). But this lone versional witness finds no support in the fathers, other versions, or any Greek MSS and is therefore to be regarded as spurious.<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="mat.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:16)  Or "Messiah"; both "Christ" (Greek) and "Messiah" (Hebrew and Aramaic) mean "one who has been anointed."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:16)  The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">cristov"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">cristos</FONT>) was originally an adjective ("anointed"), developing in LXX into a substantive ("an anointed one"), then developing still further into a technical generic term ("the anointed one"). In the intertestamental period it developed further into a technical term referring to the hoped-for anointed one, that is, a specific individual. In the NT the development starts there (technical-specific), is so used in the gospels, and then develops in Paul to mean virtually Jesus' last name.<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="mat.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:17)  Or "Messiah"; both "Christ" (Greek) and "Messiah" (Hebrew and Aramaic) mean "one who has been anointed."<br>

 <b>sn</b> (1:19)  In the Jewish context, "full betrothal was so binding that its breaking required a certificate of divorce, and the death of one party made the other a widow or widower (<i>m. Ketub.</i> 1:2; <i>m. Sota</i> 1:5; <i>m. Git.</i> passim...)" (R. H. Gundry, <i>Matthew: A Commentary on his Literary and Theological Art</i>, 21).<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="mat.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:20)  <i>Grk </i>"behold, an angel." The Greek word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ijdouv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">idou</FONT>) is not translated because it has no exact English equivalent here, but adds interest and emphasis (BAGD 371 s.v. 1.b.<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">d</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn15" href="mat.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:20)  Or "the angel of the Lord." Linguistically, "angel of the Lord" is the same in both testaments (and thus, he is either "an angel of the Lord" or "the angel of the Lord" in both testaments). For arguments and implications, see D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax</i>, 252; M. J. Davidson, "Angels," <i>DJG</i>, 9; W. G. MacDonald argues for "an angel" in both testaments: "Christology and `The Angel of the Lord'," 324-35.<br>
 <a name="fn16" href="mat.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:21)  <i>Grk</i> "you will call his name."<br>
 <a name="fn17" href="mat.htm#fnB17"><sup>18</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:21)  The Greek form of the name <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Ihsous</FONT>, which was translated into Latin as <i>Jesus</i>, is the same as the Hebrew <FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">Yeshua</FONT> (Joshua), which means "Yahweh saves" (Yahweh is typically rendered as "LORD" in the OT). It was a fairly common name among Jews in 1st century Palestine, as references to a number of people by this name in the LXX and Josephus indicate.<br>

 <a name="fn22" href="mat.htm#fnB22"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:24)  See the note on the word "Lord" in 1:20. Here the translation "the angel of the Lord" is used because the Greek article (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oJ</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jo</FONT>) which precedes <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">a[ggelo"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">angelos</FONT>) is taken as an anaphoric article (D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax</i>, 217-19) referring back to the angel mentioned in v. 20.<br>
 <a name="fn23" href="mat.htm#fnB23"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:25)  Or "did not have sexual relations"; <i>Grk </i>"was not knowing her." The verb "know" (in both Hebrew and Greek) is a frequent biblical euphemism for sexual relations. However, a translation like "did not have sexual relations with her" is too graphic in light of the popularity and wide use of Matthew's infancy narrative. Thus the somewhat more subdued but still clear "did not have marital relations" was selected.<br>
 <a name="fn24" href="mat.htm#fnB24"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:25)  <i>Grk </i>"and he called his name Jesus." The coordinate clause has been translated as a relative clause in English for stylistic reasons.<br>

 <a name="fn28" href="mat.htm#fnB28"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:2)  Or "in its rising," referring to the astrological significance of a star in a particular portion of the sky. The term used for the "East" in v. 1 is <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajnatolaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">anatolai</FONT><FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">,</FONT> a plural form that is used typically of the rising of the sun), while in vv. 2 and 9 the singular <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajnatolhv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">anatolh</FONT>) is used. The singular is typically used of the rising of a star and as such should not normally be translated "in the east" (cf. BAGD 62 s.v. 1: "because of the sg. and the article in contrast to <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajpoV ajnatolw'n</FONT>, vs. 1, [it is] prob. not a geograph. expr. like the latter, but rather astronomical; likew. vs. 9").<br>

 <a name="fn30" href="mat.htm#fnB30"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  Or "and scribes of the people." The traditional rendering of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">grammateuv"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">grammateu"</FONT>) as "scribe" does not communicate much to the modern English reader, for whom the term might mean "professional copyist," if it means anything at all. The people referred to here were recognized experts in the law of Moses and in traditional laws and regulations. Thus "expert in the law" comes closer to the meaning for the modern reader.<br>
 <a name="fn31" href="mat.htm#fnB31"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  Or "Messiah"; both "Christ" (Greek) and "Messiah" (Hebrew and Aramaic) mean "one who has been anointed."<br>

 <b>sn</b> (4:19)  The kind of fishing envisioned was net--not line--fishing (cf. v. 18; cf. also BAGD 47 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajmfivblhstron,</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajmfibavllw</FONT>) which involved a circular net that had heavy weights around its perimeter. The occupation of fisherman was labor-intensive. The imagery of using a lure and a line (and waiting for the fish to strike) is thus foreign to this text. Rather, the imagery of a fisherman involved much strain, long hours, and often little results. Jesus' point may have been one or more of the following: the strenuousness of evangelism, the work ethic that it required, persistence and dedication to the task (often in spite of minimal results), the infinite value of the new "catch" (viz., people), and perhaps an eschatological theme of snatching people from judgment (cf. W. L. Lane, <i>Mark</i> [NICNT], 67). If this last motif is in view, then catching people is the opposite of catching fish: the fish would be caught, killed, cooked, and eaten; people would be caught so as to remove them from eternal destruction and to give them new life.<br>

Though the origin of the synagogue is not entirely clear, it seems to have arisen in the post-exilic community during the intertestamental period. A town could establish a synagogue if there were at least ten men. In normative Judaism of the NT period, the OT scripture was read and discussed in the synagogue by the men who were present (see the Mishnah, <i>m. Megillah</i> 3-4; <i>m. Berakhot</i> 2).<br>
 <a name="fn130" href="mat.htm#fnB130"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:24)  <i>Grk </i>"And they," "they" is probably an indefinite plural, referring to people in general rather than to the Syrians (cf. v. 25).<br>

The Greek text reads, "People brought to him all who suffered with various illnesses and afflictions, those possessed by demons, epileptics, and paralytics." Even though it is obvious that four separate groups of people are in view here, following the Greek word order could lead to the misconception that certain people were possessed by epileptics and paralytics.

 <a name="fn145" href="mat.htm#fnB145"><sup>12</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:13)  The difficulty of this saying is understanding how <i>salt </i>could lose <i>its flavor</i> since its chemical properties cannot change. It is thus often assumed that Jesus was referring to chemically impure salt, perhaps a natural salt which, when exposed to the elements, had all the genuine salt leached out, leaving only the sediment or impurities behind. Others have suggested that the background of the saying is the use of salt blocks by Arab bakers to line the floor of their ovens; under the intense heat these blocks would eventually crystallize and undergo a change in chemical composition, finally being thrown out as unserviceable. A saying in the Talmud (<i>b. Bekhorot</i> 8b) attributed to R. Joshua ben Chananja (c. A.D. 90), when asked the question "When salt loses its flavor, how can it be made salty again?" is said to have replied, "By salting it with the afterbirth of a mule." He was then asked, "Then does the mule (being sterile) bear young?" to which he replied: "Can salt lose its flavor?" The point appears to be that both are impossible. The saying, while admittedly late, suggests that culturally the loss of flavor by salt was regarded as an impossibility. Genuine salt can never lose its flavor. In this case the saying by Jesus here may be similar to Matt 19:24, where it is likewise impossible for the camel to go through the eye of a sewing needle.<br>

Most modern readers would not understand what a `tunic' was any more than they would be familiar with a `<i>chiton</i>.' On the other hand, attempts to find a modern equivalent are also a problem: "shirt" conveys the idea of a much shorter garment that covers only the upper body, and "undergarment" (given the styles of modern underwear) is more misleading still. "Tunic" was therefore employed, but with a note to explain its nature.<br>

The addition can easily be explained as a scribal alteration for liturgical purposes.

Most scholars take the term to describe age or length of life here, although a few refer it to bodily stature (see BAGD 345 s.v. 2 for discussion). Worry about length of life seems a more natural figure than worry about height. However, the point either way is clear: worrying adds nothing to life span or height.<br>

 <a name="fn300" href="mat.htm#fnB300"><sup>40</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:22)  There are several options for the meaning of Jesus' reply <i>Leave the dead to bury their own dead</i>: (1) Recent research suggests that burial customs in Palestine involved a reinterment of the bones a year after the initial burial, once the flesh had rotted away. At that point the son would have placed his father's bones in a special box to be set into the wall of the tomb. Thus Jesus could well be rebuking the man for wanting to wait around for as much as a year before making a commitment to follow him. In 1st century Jewish culture, to have followed Jesus rather than burying one's father would have seriously dishonored one's father (cf. Tobit 4:3-4). (2) The remark is an idiom (possibly a proverbial saying) that means, "The matter in question is not the real issue," in which case Jesus was making a word-play on the wording of the man's (literal) request (see L&amp;N 33.137). (3) This remark could be a figurative reference to various kinds of people, meaning, "Let the spiritually dead bury the dead." (4) It could also be literal and designed to shock the hearer by the surprise of the contrast. Whichever option is preferred, it is clear that the most important priority is to <i>follow</i> Jesus.<br>

Luke 8:26 and Mark 5:1 record this miracle as occurring "in the region of the Gerasenes." "Irrespective of how one settles this issue, for the [second and] Third Evangelist the chief concern is that Jesus has crossed over into Gentile territory, `opposite Galilee'" (J. B. Green, <i>Luke </i>[NICNT], 337). The region of Gadara extended to the Sea of Galilee and included the town of Sennabris on the southern shore--the town that the herdsmen most likely entered after the drowning of the pigs.<br>

The equivalent Hebrew expression in the OT had two basic meanings: (1) When one person was unjustly bothering another, the injured party could say "What to me and to you?" meaning, "What have I done to you that you should do this to me?" (Judg 11:12, 2 Chr 35:21, 1 Kgs 17:18). (2) When someone was asked to get involved in a matter he felt was no business of his own, he could say to the one asking him, "What to me and to you?" meaning, "That is your business, how am I involved?" (2 Kgs 3:13, Hos 14:8). These nuances were apparently expanded in Greek, but the basic notions of defensive hostility (option 1) and indifference or disengagement (option 2) are still present. BAGD suggests the following as glosses for this expression: <i>What have I to do with you? What have we in common? Never mind!

He just used it. It also could be an idiom in Aramaic meaning either "some person" or "me." So there is a little ambiguity in its use here, since its origin is not clear at this point.

There was a tax booth in Capernaum, which was on the trade route from Damascus to Galilee and the Mediterranean.

It was here that Jesus met Matthew (also named Levi [see Mark 2:14, Luke 5:27]) who was ultimately employed by the Romans, though perhaps more directly responsible to Herod Antipas.

See Exod 25:30; 35:13; 39:36; Lev 24:5-9. Each loaf was made from 3 quarts (3.5 liters; <i>Heb</i> "two tenths of an ephah") of fine flour. The loaves were placed on a table in the holy place of the tabernacle, on the north side opposite the lampstand (Exod 26:35). It was the duty of the priest each Sabbath to place fresh bread on the table; the loaves from the previous week were then given to Aaron and his descendants, who ate them in the holy place, because they were considered sacred (Lev 24:9).

 <a name="fn535" href="mat.htm#fnB535"><sup>35</sup></a><b>sn</b> (12:25)  Jesus here demonstrated the absurdity of the thinking of the religious leaders who maintained that he was in league with Satan and that he actually derived his power from the devil. He first teaches (vv. 25-28) that if he casts out demons by the ruler of the demons, then in reality Satan is fighting against himself, with the result that his kingdom has come to an end. He then teaches (v. 29) about tying up the strong man to prove that he does not need to align himself with the devil because he is more powerful. Jesus defeated Satan at his temptation (4:1-11) and by his exorcisms he clearly demonstrated himself to be stronger than the devil. The passage reveals the desperate condition of the religious leaders, who in their hatred for Jesus end up attributing the work of the Holy Spirit to Satan (a position for which they will be held accountable, 12:31-32).<br>

In fact, all three conditions in these verses are first class. The examples are made totally parallel. The expected answer is that Satan's kingdom will not stand, so the suggestion makes no sense. Satan would not seek to heal.<br>
 <a name="fn538" href="mat.htm#fnB538"><sup>38</sup></a><b>sn</b> (12:27)  Most read <i>your sons</i> as a reference to Jewish exorcists, but more likely this is a reference to the disciples of Jesus themselves, who are also Jewish and have been healing as well (R.

 <a name="fn539" href="mat.htm#fnB539"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (12:27)  The pronoun "them" is not in the Greek text, but is implied. Direct objects were frequently omitted in Greek when clear from the context.<br>

Does it mean merely "approach" or actually "come upon"? Is the arrival of the kingdom in process or merely anticipated? Two factors favor arrival. First, the prepositional phrase "on you" suggests arrival (Dan 4:24, 28 Theodotion). Second, the following illustration in v. 29 looks at the healing as portraying Satan being overrun. So the presence of God's authority has come. See also L&amp;N 13.123 for the translation of <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">fqavnw</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">fqanw</FONT>) as "to happen to already, to come upon, to come upon already."<br>

 <b>sn </b> (12:32) <i>Whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.</i> This passage has troubled many people, who have wondered whether or not they have committed this sin. Three things must be kept in mind: (1) the nature of the sin is to ascribe what is the obvious work of the Holy Spirit (e.g., releasing people from Satan's power) to Satan himself; (2) it is not simply a momentary doubt or sinful attitude, but is indeed a settled condition which opposes the Spirit's work, as typified by the religious leaders who opposed Jesus; and (3) a person who is concerned about it has probably never committed this sin, for those who commit it here (i.e., the religious leaders) are not in the least concerned about Jesus' warning.<br>

 <a name="fn589" href="mat.htm#fnB589"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (13:3)  Though parables can contain a variety of figures of speech (cf. the remainder of chapter 13), many times they are simply stories that attempt to teach spiritual truth (which is unknown to the hearers) by using a comparison with something known to the hearers. In general, parables usually advance a single idea, though there may be many parts and characters in a single parable and subordinate ideas may expand the main idea further. The beauty of using the parable as a teaching device is that it draws the listener into the story, elicits an evaluation, and demands a response.<br>

Sowing would occur in late fall or early winter (October to December) in the rainy season, looking for sprouting in April or May and a June harvest. The use of seed as a figure for God's giving life has OT roots (Isa 55:10-11). The point of the parable of the sower is to illustrate the various responses to the message of the kingdom of God.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (13:11)  The key term <i>secrets</i> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">musthvrion</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">musthrion</FONT>) can mean either (1) a new revelation or (2) a revealing interpretation of existing revelation as in Dan 2:17-23, 27-30. Jesus seems to be explaining how current events develop old promises, since the NT consistently links the events of Jesus' ministry and message with old promises (Rom 1:1-4; Heb 1:1-2). The traditional translation of this word, "mystery," is misleading to the modern English reader because it suggests a secret which people have tried to uncover but which they have failed to understand (L&amp;N 28.77).<br>

 <a name="fn633" href="mat.htm#fnB633"><sup>47</sup></a><b>sn</b> (13:32)  The point of the parable seems to be that while the kingdom of God may appear to have insignificant and unnoticeable beginnings (i.e., in the ministry of Jesus), it will someday (i.e., at the second advent) be great and quite expansive. The kingdom, however, is not to be equated with the church, but rather the church is an expression of the kingdom. Also, there is important OT background in the image of the mustard seed that grew and became a tree: Ezek 17:22-24 pictures the reemergence of the Davidic house where people can find calm and shelter. Like the mustard seed, it would start out small but grow to significant size.<br>

The reference to <i>after six days</i> in 17:1 seems to indicate that Mark had the transfiguration in mind insofar as it was a substantial prefiguring of the consummation of the kingdom (although this interpretation is not without its problems).

So the disciples saw Jesus <i>transfigured</i>, and they were getting a sneak preview of the great glory that Jesus would have (only his glory is more inherent to him as one who shares in the rule of the kingdom).<br>

However, in light of the following verse and Jesus' other warning statements in Matthew about "fiery hell," "the outer darkness," etc., it is best not to dismiss this as mere imagery.<br>

The latter reading is an assimilation to the parallel in Mark; the former reading is motivated apparently by the clarification needed (especially to give the following <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">aujtou'</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">autou</FONT>] an antecedent). But a few significant MSS have neither noun (viz., <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> * B L <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">G</FONT> 579 <i>et pauci</i>).

This shorter reading may be due to assimilation to the Markan parallel, but since it is attested in early and diverse witnesses (e.g., <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> D L <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Q</FONT> lat) and since the parallel verse (Mark 10:4) already departs at many points, the shorter reading seems more likely to be original.

 <b>sn</b> (19:7)  A quotation from Deut 24:1. The Pharisees were all in agreement that the OT <i>permitted a man to write a legal document and</i> <i>divorce</i> his wife (not vice-versa) and that remarriage was therefore sanctioned. But the two rabbinic schools of Shammai and Hillel differed on the grounds for divorce. Shammai was much stricter than Hillel and permitted divorce only in the case of sexual immorality.

 <a name="fn992" href="mat.htm#fnB992"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tc</b> (21:31)  Verses 29-31 involve a rather complex textual problem. The variants cluster into three different groups: (1) The first son says "no" and later has a change of heart, and the second son says "yes" but does not go. The second son is called the one who does his father's will. This reading is found in the Western MSS. But the reading is so hard as to be next to impossible. One can only suspect some tampering with the text (e.g., that the Pharisees would indeed give lip-service to obedience and would betray themselves in their very response) or extreme carelessness on the part of the scribe. (Either option, of course, is not improbable with this particular texttype, and with codex D in particular.) The other two major variants are more difficult to assess. Essentially, the responses are sensical (the son who does his father's will is the one who changes his mind after saying "no"): (2) The first son says "no" and later has a change of heart, and the second son says "yes" but does not go. But here, the first son is called the one who does his father's will (unlike the Western reading).

This is the reading found in B <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Q</FONT> <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Euml;</FONT><sup>13 </sup>700 and several versional witnesses. Both of these latter two readings make good sense and have significantly better textual support than the first reading. The real question, then, is: Is the first son or the second the obedient one? If one were to argue simply from the parabolic logic, the second son would be seen as the obedient one (hence, the third reading). The first son would represent the Pharisees (or Jews) who claim to obey God, but do not (cf. Matt 23:3). This comports well with the parable of the prodigal son (in which the oldest son represents the unbelieving Jews). Further, the chronological sequence of the second son being obedient fits well with the real scene: Gentiles and tax collectors and prostitutes are not, collectively, God's chosen people, but they do repent and come to God, while the Jewish leaders claimed to be obedient to God but did nothing. At the same time, the external evidence is weaker for this reading (though stronger than the first reading), not as widespread, and certainly suspect because of how neatly it fits. One suspects scribal manipulation at this point. (One might even conjecture that the Western reading originated from some attempt to smooth things out, but the scribe got confused along the way and created a worse blunder, just as several Georgian witnesses seemed to do.) Thus, the second reading looks to be superior to the other two on both external and transcriptional grounds. But what about intrinsic evidence? One can surmise that Jesus didn't always give predictable responses. In this instance, he may well have painted a picture in which the Pharisees saw themselves as the first son, only to stun them with his application (v. 32).<br>

But it is very questionable that the Greek term <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">geneav</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">genea</FONT>) can have this meaning. Two other options are possible. (2) <i>Generation</i> might mean "this type of generation" and refer to the generation of wicked humanity. Then the point is that humanity will not perish, because God will redeem it. Or (3) <i>generation </i>may refer to "the generation that sees the signs of the end" (v. 30), who will also see the end itself.

Further, the parallel in Mark 13:32 has <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oujdeV oJ uiJov"</FONT>, with almost no witnesses omitting the expression. Hence, it is doubtful that the omission of "neither the Son" is due to the scribes. In keeping with Matthew's general softening of Mark's harsh statements throughout his Gospel, it is more likely that the omission of "neither the Son" is part of the original text of Matthew, being an intentional change on the part of the author.

 <a name="fn1447" href="mat.htm#fnB1447"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tc</b> (28:15)  The word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">hJmevra"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Jhmeras</FONT>) is found after <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">shvmeron</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">shmeron</FONT>) in some early and important witnesses (chiefly B D L <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">Q</FONT> lat), but looks to be a clarifying (or perhaps redundant) note. The shorter reading is thus preferred.<br>
 <a name="fn1448" href="mat.htm#fnB1448"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:16)  Here <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dev</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">de</FONT>) has been translated as "so" to indicate the implied result of Jesus' instructions in v. 10.<br>
 <a name="fn1449" href="mat.htm#fnB1449"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:17)  Here <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>) is not translated.<br>
 <a name="fn1450" href="mat.htm#fnB1450"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:17)  The word "him" is not in the Greek text, but is implied. Direct objects were frequently omitted in Greek when clear from the context.<br>
 <a name="fn1451" href="mat.htm#fnB1451"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:17)  The Greek text reads here <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oiJ deV ejdivstasan</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">Joi de edistasan</FONT>). Some scholars argue that the article is functioning like a personal pronoun, thus "<i>they</i> doubted" (e.g., D. A. Hagner, <i>Matthew</i> [WBC], 2:884). If so, then all the disciples would be in view. The translation of the text takes <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">oiJ</FONT> as an alternative pronoun which has a partitive notion (i.e., some of the disciples doubted, but not all). The difficulty with the personal pronoun view is that there are no examples of it in Matthew in which the same subject immediately precedes with its own verb (as would be the case in "they worshiped...they doubted"). Such, in fact, would be quite awkward, for the article would be unnecessary since the pronominal referent is already embedded in the verb. The only reason for the article here would be to distinguish the subject in some way; but if the same subject is in view, no distinction is being made.<br>
 <a name="fn1452" href="mat.htm#fnB1452"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:18)  <i>Grk </i>"coming, Jesus spoke to them, saying." The participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">levgwn</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">legwn</FONT>, "saying") is redundant in contemporary English and has not been translated. Here <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kaiv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">kai</FONT>) has been translated as "then" to indicate the implied sequence of events within the narrative.<br>
 <a name="fn1453" href="mat.htm#fnB1453"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:19)  "Go...baptize...teach" are participles modifying the imperative verb "make disciples." According to D. B. Wallace (<i>Exegetical Syntax</i>, 645) the first participle (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">poreuqevnte"</FONT>,<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl"> poreuqentes</FONT>, "Go") fits the typical structural pattern for the attendant circumstance participle (aorist participle preceding aorist main verb, with the mood of the main verb usually imperative or indicative) and thus picks up the mood (imperative in this case) from the main verb (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">maqhteuvsate</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">maqhteusate</FONT>, "make disciples"). This means that semantically the action of "going" is commanded, just as "making disciples" is. As for the two participles that follow the main verb (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">baptivzonte"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">baptizontes</FONT>, "baptizing"; and <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">didavskonte"</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">didaskontes</FONT>, "teaching"), according to Wallace these do not fit the normal pattern for attendant circumstance participles, since they are present participles and follow the aorist main verb. However, some interpreters do see them as carrying additional imperative force in context. Others regard them as means, manner, or even result.<br>
 <a name="fn1454" href="mat.htm#fnB1454"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (28:20)  The Greek word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ijdouv</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">idou</FONT>) is translated here as "remember" (BAGD 371 s.v. 1.c).<br>
 <a name="fn1455" href="mat.htm#fnB1455"><sup>28</sup></a><b>sn</b> (28:20)  <i>I am with you</i>.<i> </i>Matthew's Gospel begins with the prophecy that the Savior's name would be "Emmanuel, that is, `God <i>with</i> us,'" (1:23, in which the author has linked Isa 7:14 and 8:8, 10 together) and it ends with Jesus' promise to be <i>with</i> his disciples forever. The Gospel of Matthew thus forms an inclusio about Jesus in his relationship to his people that suggests his deity.
