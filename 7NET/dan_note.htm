 <b>sn</b> (1:1)  The <i>third year of the reign of Jehoiakim</i> would be ca. 605 B.C. At this time Daniel would have been a teenager. The reference to Jehoikim's <i>third</i> year poses a serious <i>crux interpretum</i>, since elsewhere these events are linked to his <i>fourth</i> year (Jer 25:1; cf. 2 Kgs 24:1; 2 Chr 36:5-8). Apparently Daniel is following an accession year chronology, whereby the first partial year of a king's reign was reckoned as the accession year rather than as the first year of his reign. Jeremiah, on the other hand, is following a non-accession year chronology, whereby the accession year is reckoned as the first year of the king's reign. In that case, the conflict is only superficial. Most modern scholars, however, have concluded that Daniel is historically inaccurate here.<br>

 <a name="fn12" href="dan.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:3)  It is possible that the word <i>Ashpenaz</i> is not a proper name at all, but a general term for "inn-keeper." See J. J. Collins, <i>Daniel</i>, 127, n. 9. However, the ancient versions understand the term to be a name.<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="dan.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:3)  The word <i>court official </i>(Hebrew <i>saris</i>) need not mean "eunuch" specifically, although in the case of the Book of Daniel there was in Jewish literature a common tradition to that effect.<br>

 <a name="fn18" href="dan.htm#fnB18"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:6)  The names reflect a Jewish heritage. In Hebrew <i>Daniel</i> means "God is my judge"; <i>Hananiah</i> means "the Lord is gracious"; <i>Mishael</i> means "who is what God is?"; <i>Azariah</i> means "the Lord has helped."<br>
 <a name="fn19" href="dan.htm#fnB19"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:7)  The LXX and Vg lack the verb.<br>
 <a name="fn20" href="dan.htm#fnB20"><sup>21</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:7)  The meanings of the Babylonian names are more conjectural than is the case with the Hebrew names. The probable etymologies are as follows: <i>Belteshazzar</i> means "protect his life," although the MT vocalization may suggest "Belti, protect the king" (cf. Dan 4:8); <i>Shadrach</i> perhaps means "command of Aku"; <i>Meshach</i> is of uncertain meaning; <i>Abednego</i> means "servant of Nego." The purpose of assigning pagan names to the Hebrew youths may have to do with an attempt to erase from their memory their Israelite heritage.<br>
 <a name="fn21" href="dan.htm#fnB21"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:8) <i>Heb</i> "placed in his heart."<br>
 <a name="fn22" href="dan.htm#fnB22"><sup>23</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:8)  Various reasons have been suggested as to why such food would <i>defile</i> Daniel. Perhaps it had to do with violations of Mosaic law with regard to unclean foods, or perhaps it had to do with such food having been offered to idols.<br>

 <a name="fn29" href="dan.htm#fnB29"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:20)  The MT lacks the conjunction, reading the first word in the phrase as a construct ("wisdom of insight"). While this reading is not impossible, it seems better to follow Theodotion, the Syriac, the Vg, and the Sahidic Coptic, all of which have the conjunction.<br>
 <a name="fn30" href="dan.htm#fnB30"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:20) <i>Heb</i> "hands."<br>
 <a name="fn31" href="dan.htm#fnB31"><sup>32</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:21)  Cyrus' <i>first year</i> in control of Babylon would be 539 B.C. Daniel actually lived beyond the first year of Cyrus, as is clear from 10:1. The purpose of the statement in 1:21 is merely to say that Daniel's life spanned the entire period of the neo-Babylonian empire. His life span also included the early years of the Persian control of Babylon. However, by that time his age was so advanced that he probably died sometime in the 530's B.C.<br>
 <a name="fn32" href="dan.htm#fnB32"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:1) <i>Heb</i> "Nebuchadnezzar's."<br>

 <a name="fn35" href="dan.htm#fnB35"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:1) <i>Heb</i> "his sleep left (?) him." The use of the verb <i>hyh</i> here is unusual. Cf. Dan 8:27. Some scholars emend the verb to read <i>nadedah</i> ("fled"); cf. Dan 6:19.<br>

 <a name="fn37" href="dan.htm#fnB37"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:2)  The term <i>Chaldeans</i> (Hebrew <i>kasdim</i>) is used in the Book of Daniel both in an ethnic sense and, as here, to refer to a caste of Babylonian wise men and astrologers.<br>

 <a name="fn42" href="dan.htm#fnB42"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:4)  Contrary to common belief, the point here is not that the Chaldeans replied to the king in the Aramaic language. It was this view that led in the past to Aramaic being referred to as "Chaldee." Rather, this phrase is better understood as an editorial note marking the fact that from <b>2:4b</b> through <b>7:28</b> the language of the book shifts from Hebrew to Aramaic. In 8:1, and for the remainder of the book, the language returns to Hebrew. Various views have been advanced to account for this change of language, most of which are unconvincing. Most likely the change in language is a reflection of stages in the transmission history of the Book of Daniel.<br>
 <a name="fn43" href="dan.htm#fnB43"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:4) <i>Aram</i> "your servants." Cf. v. 7.<br>
 <a name="fn44" href="dan.htm#fnB44"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:5) <i>Aram</i> "answered and said," a common semitism.<br>
 <a name="fn45" href="dan.htm#fnB45"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (2:5)  The translation "the matter is gone from me," suggesting that the king had simply forgotten the dream, is incorrect. It seems clear from what follows that Nebuchadnezzar clearly recalls the content of the dream, although obviously he does not know what to make of it. By not divulging the dream itself to the would-be interpreters, he intends to find out whether they are simply leading him on. If they can tell him the dream's content, which he is able to verify, he then can have confidence in their interpretation. <br>

The word may refer to the severity of the king's decree (i.e., "harsh"), although it would seem that in a delicate situation such as this Daniel would avoid this kind of criticism of the king's actions. The translation above understands the word to refer to the immediacy, not harshness, of the decree. <br>
 <a name="fn55" href="dan.htm#fnB55"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tc</b> (2:16)  Theodotion and the Syriac lack the words "went in and."<br>

 <a name="fn86" href="dan.htm#fnB86"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:1)  The Greek OT (LXX) introduces this chapter with the following chronological note: "in the eighteenth year of." Such a date would place these events at about the time of the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 B.C. (cf. 2 Kgs 25:8). However, there seems to be no real basis for associating the events of Daniel 3 with this date.<br>
 <a name="fn87" href="dan.htm#fnB87"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:1)  There is, of course, no need to think of Nebuchadnezzar's <i>image</i> as being <i>solid</i> gold. No doubt the sense is that it was <i>overlaid</i> with gold (cf. Isa 40:19; Jer 10:3-4), with the result that it presented a dazzling self-compliment to the greatness of Nebuchadnezzar's achievements.<br>
 <a name="fn88" href="dan.htm#fnB88"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:1)  According to a number of patristic authors, the <i>image</i> represented a deification of Nebuchadnezzar himself. This is not clear from the biblical text, however.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (3:1)  The dimensions of the image (<i>ninety feet</i> high and <i>nine feet</i> wide) imply that it did not possess normal human proportions, unless a base for the image is included in the height dimension. The ancient world knew of other tall statues. The Colossus of Rhodes, for example--the huge statue of Helios which stood (c. 280-224 B.C.) at the entrance to the harbor at Rhodes and was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world--was said to be seventy cubits (105 ft or 32 m) in height, which would make it even taller than this image of Nebuchadnezzar.<br>
 <a name="fn91" href="dan.htm#fnB91"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:2)  The specific duties of the seven types of officials listed here (cf. vv. 3, 27) are unclear.

Though much has been made of this in terms of suggesting a date in the hellenistic period for the writing of the book, it is not surprising that a few Greek cultural terms, all of them the names of musical instruments, should appear in this book. As a number of scholars have pointed out, the bigger surprise (if, in fact, the book is to be dated to the hellenistic period) may be that there are so <i>few</i> Greek loanwords in Daniel. <br>

 <a name="fn111" href="dan.htm#fnB111"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:17)  The Aramaic expression is very difficult to interpret. It may be an implicit reference back to Nebuchadnezzar's comment in v. 15, which denies the existence of a god capable of delivering from the king's power. Attempts to take <i>`itay</i> with the participle later in the verse (<i>yakil</i>, "able"), must explain why such a periphrastic construction would be broken apart in this way.<br>

 <a name="fn117" href="dan.htm#fnB117"><sup>32</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:23)  The deuterocanonical writings known as The Prayer of Azariah and The Song of the Three present at this point a confession and petition for God's forgiveness and a celebration of God's grace for the three Jewish youths in the fiery furnace.

 <a name="fn119" href="dan.htm#fnB119"><sup>34</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:25)  The phrase <i>like that of a god</i> is in Hebrew "like that of a son of the gods." Many patristic writers understood this phrase in a christological sense (i.e., "the Son of God"). But it should be remembered that these are words spoken by a pagan who is seeking to explain things from his own polytheistic frame of reference; the phrase "like a son of the gods" is equivalent to "like a divine being."<br>

 <a name="fn125" href="dan.htm#fnB125"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:31)  Beginning with <b>4:1</b>, the verse numbers through <b>4:37</b> in the English Bible differ from the verse numbers in the Aramaic text (<i>BHS</i>), with <b>4:1 </b>ET = <b>3:31</b> AT, <b>4:2 </b>ET = <b>3:32</b> AT, <b>4:3</b> ET = <b>3:33</b> AT, <b>4:4</b> ET = <b>4:1</b> AT, etc., through <b>4:37</b> ET = <b>4:34</b> AT. Thus Dan 3:31-33 of the Aramaic text appears as Dan 4:1-3 in the English Bible, and the corresponding verses of ch. 4 differ accordingly. In spite of the division of the Aramaic text, a good case can be made for thinking that verses 3:31-33 AT (= 4:1-3 ET) are actually the introduction to ch. 4.<br>

 <a name="fn127" href="dan.htm#fnB127"><sup>3</sup></a><b>sn</b> (4:1)  This verse marks the beginning of chap. 4 in the Aramaic text of Daniel (see the note on <b>4:1</b>). The Greek OT (LXX) has the following addition: "In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign he said." This date would suggest a link to the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 B.C. In general, the LXX of chapters 4-6 are very different from the MT, so much so that the following notes will call attention only to selected readings. In Daniel 4 the LXX lacks sizable portions of material in the MT (e.g., vv. 3-6, 31-32), includes sizable portions of material not in the MT (e.g., v. 14a, parts of vv. 16, 28), has a different order of some material (e.g., v. 8 after v. 9), and in some instances is vastly different from the MT (e.g., vv. 30, 34). Whether these differences are due to an excessively paraphrastic translation technique adopted for these chapters in the LXX, or are due to differences in the underlying <i>Vorlage</i> of the LXX, is a disputed matter. There is a growing trend in modern scholarship to take the LXX of chapters 4-6 much more seriously than was the case in most of earlier text-critical studies that considered this issue.<br>

The MT implies that the king required Daniel to disclose both the dream and its interpretation, as in chapter 2.

 <a name="fn139" href="dan.htm#fnB139"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (4:13)  This <i>watcher</i> is apparently an angel. The Greek OT (LXX) in fact has <i>angelos</i> ("angel") here.

However, Nabonidus spent long periods of time at Teima, and during those times Belshazzar his son was <i>de facto</i> king of Babylon. This arrangement may help to explain why later in this chapter Belsahzzar promises that the successful interpreter of the handwriting on the wall will be made<i> third</i> ruler in the kingdom. If Belshazzar was in effect second ruler in the kingdom, this would be the highest honor he could afford.<br>

In the following discourse this woman is able to recall things about Daniel that go back to the days of Nebuchadnezzar, things that Belshazzar does not seem to have the same recollection of. It is likely that she was the wife not of Belshazzar but of Nabonidus or perhaps even Nebuchadnezzar. In that case, "queen" here means "queen mother."<br>

 <a name="fn217" href="dan.htm#fnB217"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn </b> (6:4) <i>Aram</i> "from the side of the kingdom."<br>
 <a name="fn218" href="dan.htm#fnB218"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:4)  <i>Aram</i> "no negligence or corruption was found in him." The Greek version of Theodotion lacks the phrase "and no negligence or corruption was found in him."<br>

 <a name="fn221" href="dan.htm#fnB221"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:6)  The Aramaic verb <i>rgs </i>occurs three times in this chapter (vv. 7, 12, 16). Its meaning is widely disputed by commentators and versions. The suggestion that it means "to come thronging" (BDB 1112; cf. NAB) seems inappropriate, since it is unlikely that subordinates would enter a royal court in such a reckless fashion. The ancient versions struggled with the word and are not in agreement in their understandings of its meaning. In this chapter the word apparently means to act in agreement with other parties in the pursuit of a duplicitous goal, namely the entrapment of Daniel.<br>
 <a name="fn222" href="dan.htm#fnB222"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn </b> (6:6) <i>Aram</i> "thus they were saying."<br>

 <a name="fn226" href="dan.htm#fnB226"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (6:10)  In later rabbinic thought this verse was sometimes cited as a proof-text for the notion that one should pray only in a house with windows. See the Talmud, <i>b. Berakhot</i> 34b.<br>
 <a name="fn227" href="dan.htm#fnB227"><sup>12</sup></a><b>sn</b> (6:10)  According to some scholars, the Muslim practice of praying toward Mecca is derived from this text.<br>
 <a name="fn228" href="dan.htm#fnB228"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (6:10)  This is apparently the only specific mention in the OT of prayer being regularly offered three times a day. The practice was probably not unique to Daniel.<br>
 <a name="fn229" href="dan.htm#fnB229"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tc</b> (6:10)  Read with several medieval Hebrew MSS and printed editions <i>hawah</i> rather than the MT <i>hu'.</i> <br>

 <b>sn </b> (6:10) No specific posture for <i>offering prayers</i> is prescribed in the OT. Kneeling, as here, and standing were both practiced.<br>
 <a name="fn231" href="dan.htm#fnB231"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:11)  <i>Aram</i> "those men"; the referent (the administrative officials who had earlier approached the king about the edict) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn232" href="dan.htm#fnB232"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tc</b> (6:12)  The MT also has "about the edict of the king," but this phrase is absent in the LXX and the Syriac. The present translation deletes the expression.<br>

 <a name="fn241" href="dan.htm#fnB241"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (6:16)  The <i>den</i> was perhaps a pit below ground level which could be safely observed from above.<br>

 <a name="fn244" href="dan.htm#fnB244"><sup>29</sup></a><b>sn</b> (6:17)  The purpose of the den being <i>sealed</i> was to prevent unauthorized tampering with the opening of the den. Any disturbance of the seal would immediately alert the officials to improper activity of this sort.<br>
 <a name="fn245" href="dan.htm#fnB245"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn </b> (6:17) <i>Aram</i> "the signet rings."<br>
 <a name="fn246" href="dan.htm#fnB246"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:18)  The meaning of Aramaic <i>dahawah</i> is a <i>crux interpretum</i>. Suggestions include "music," "dancing girls," "concubines," "table," "food"--all of which are uncertain. The translation employed here, suggested by earlier scholars, is deliberately vague.<br>
 <a name="fn247" href="dan.htm#fnB247"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn </b> (6:18) <i>Aram</i> "his sleep fled from him."<br>
 <a name="fn248" href="dan.htm#fnB248"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn </b> (6:20) <i>Aram</i> "saying to Daniel." This phrase has not been included in the translation for stylistic reasons; it is redundant in English.<br>
 <a name="fn249" href="dan.htm#fnB249"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn </b> (6:24) <i>Aram</i> "had eaten the pieces of." Although figurative, the literal Aramaic expression is ironic, in that the accusers who had "eaten the pieces of Daniel" are themselves devoured by the lions.<br>
 <a name="fn250" href="dan.htm#fnB250"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:24)  The Aramaic active impersonal verb is often used as a substitute for the passive.<br>
 <a name="fn251" href="dan.htm#fnB251"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tc</b> (6:24)  The LXX specifies only the two overseers, together with their families, as those who were cast into the lions' den.<br>
 <a name="fn252" href="dan.htm#fnB252"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn </b> (6:26) <i>Aram</i> "until the end."<br>

 <a name="fn254" href="dan.htm#fnB254"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn</b> (6:28)  Or perhaps "in the reign of Darius, even in the reign of Cyrus." The identity of this Darius is disputed. Some take the name to be referring to Cyrus, understanding the following <i>vav</i> ("and") in an epexegetical sense ("even"). Others identify Darius with a governor of Babylon known from extra-biblical records as Gubaru, or as Cambyses, son of Cyrus. Many scholars maintain that the reference is historically mistaken.<br>
 <a name="fn255" href="dan.htm#fnB255"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:1)  The <i>first year</i> of Belshazzar's reign would have been ca. 553 B.C. Daniel would have been approximately 67 years old at the time of this vision.<br>
 <a name="fn256" href="dan.htm#fnB256"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:1)  The Aramaic is difficult here. Some scholars add a verb thought to be missing (e.g., "the visions of his head [were alarming him]"), but there is no external evidence to support such a decision and the awkwardness of the text at this point may be original.<br>
 <a name="fn257" href="dan.htm#fnB257"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn </b> (7:1) <i>Aram</i> "head of words." The phrase is absent in Theodotion.<br>
 <a name="fn258" href="dan.htm#fnB258"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn </b> (7:2) <i>Aram</i> "answered and said."<br>
 <a name="fn259" href="dan.htm#fnB259"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:2)  Or "the heavens." The same Hebrew term, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;y]m^v*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">v*m^y]&lt;</FONT>), may be translated "heavens" or "sky" depending on the context.<br>
 <a name="fn260" href="dan.htm#fnB260"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:2)  The referent of <i>the great sea</i> is unclear. The common view that the expression refers to the Mediterranean Sea is conjectural.<br>
 <a name="fn261" href="dan.htm#fnB261"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:4)  <i>Aram</i> "the heart of a man."<br>
 <a name="fn262" href="dan.htm#fnB262"><sup>8</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:4)  The identity of the first animal, derived from v. 17 and the parallels in chap. 2, is Babylon. The reference to the plucking of its wings is probably a reference to the time of Nebuchadnezzar's insanity (cf. chap. 4). The latter part of v. 4 then describes the restoration of Nebuchadnezzar. The other animals have traditionally been understood to represent respectively Media-Persia, Greece, and Rome, although most of modern scholarship identifies them as Media, Persia, and Greece. For a biblical parallel to the mention of lion, bear, and leopard together, see Hos 13:7-8.<br>
 <a name="fn263" href="dan.htm#fnB263"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:5)  The <i>three ribs</i> held securely in the mouth of the bear, representing Media-Persia, apparently symbolizes military conquest, but the exact identity of the "ribs" is not clear. Possibly it is a reference to the Persian conquest of Lydia, Egypt, and Babylonia.<br>
 <a name="fn264" href="dan.htm#fnB264"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tc</b> (7:5)  The LXX lacks the phrase "between its teeth."<br>
 <a name="fn265" href="dan.htm#fnB265"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:6)  Or, "sides."<br>
 <a name="fn266" href="dan.htm#fnB266"><sup>12</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:6)  If the third animal is Greece, the likely identification of these <i>four heads</i> is the four-fold division of the empire of Alexander the Great following his death. See note on Dan 8:8.<br>
 <a name="fn267" href="dan.htm#fnB267"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:7)  The <i>fourth animal</i> differs from the others in that it is nondescript. Apparently it was so fearsome that Daniel could find nothing with which to compare it. Attempts to identify this animal as an elephant or other known creature are needlessly speculative.<br>
 <a name="fn268" href="dan.htm#fnB268"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:7)  The Aramaic word for "teeth" is dual rather than plural, suggesting two rows of teeth.<br>
 <a name="fn269" href="dan.htm#fnB269"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:8)  <i>Aram</i> "were uprooted from before it."<br>
 <a name="fn270" href="dan.htm#fnB270"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:9)  Or "the Ancient One," although the traditional expression has been retained in the translation because it is quite familiar to many readers.<br>
 <a name="fn271" href="dan.htm#fnB271"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:9)  Traditionally the Aramaic word <i>neqe'</i> has been rendered "pure," but here it more likely means "of a lamb." Cf. the Syriac, <i>neqya'</i>, "a sheep, ewe."<br>
 <a name="fn272" href="dan.htm#fnB272"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tc</b> (7:11)  The LXX and Theodotion lack the words "I was watching" here. It is possible that these words in the MT are a dittography from the first part of the verse.<br>
 <a name="fn273" href="dan.htm#fnB273"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:12)  <i>Aram</i> "a prolonging of life was granted to them."<br>
 <a name="fn274" href="dan.htm#fnB274"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tc</b> (7:13)  The LXX has <i>epi</i> ("upon") here (cf. Matt 24:30; 26:64). Theodotion has <i>meta</i> ("with") here (cf. Mark 14:62; Rev 1:7).<br>
 <a name="fn275" href="dan.htm#fnB275"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:13)  Or "the heavens." The same Hebrew term, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;y]m^v*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">v*m^y]&lt;</FONT>), may be translated "heavens" or "sky" depending on the context.<br>
 <a name="fn276" href="dan.htm#fnB276"><sup>22</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:13)  This text is probably the main OT background for Jesus' use of the term "son of man." In both Jewish and Christian circles the reference in the Book of Daniel has traditionally been understood to refer to an individual, usually in a messianic sense. Many modern scholars, however, understand the reference to have a corporate identity. In this view, the "son of man" is to be equated with the "holy ones" (vv. 18, 21, 22, 25) or the "people of the holy ones" (v. 27) and understood as a reference to the Jewish people. Others understand Daniel's reference to be to the angel Michael.<br>
 <a name="fn277" href="dan.htm#fnB277"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:14)  Some take "serving" here in the sense of "worshiping."<br>
 <a name="fn278" href="dan.htm#fnB278"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:15)  The Aramaic text includes the phrase "in its sheath," apparently viewing the body as a container or receptacle for the spirit somewhat like a sheath or scabbard is for a knife or a sword. For this phrase the LXX and Vg have "in these things."<br>
 <a name="fn279" href="dan.htm#fnB279"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn </b> (7:16) <i>Aram</i> "matter," but the matter at hand is of course the vision.<br>
 <a name="fn280" href="dan.htm#fnB280"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:18)  The expression <i>holy ones</i> is either a reference to angels or to the saints.<br>
 <a name="fn281" href="dan.htm#fnB281"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tc</b> (7:20)  The conjunction in the MT before "eyes" is odd. The ancient versions do not seem to presuppose it.<br>
 <a name="fn282" href="dan.htm#fnB282"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:20)  <i>Aram</i> "than its companions."<br>
 <a name="fn283" href="dan.htm#fnB283"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tc</b> (7:22)  In the LXX, Syriac, and Vg the verb is active, understanding "judgment" to be the object rather than the subject of the verb (i.e., "the Ancient of Days rendered judgment"). This presupposes a different vocalization of the verb (<i>yehab </i>rather than the MT <i>yehib</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn284" href="dan.htm#fnB284"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:24)  Or "subjugate."<br>
 <a name="fn285" href="dan.htm#fnB285"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn </b> (7:25) <i>Aram</i> "wear out." The word is a <i>hapax legomenon</i> in biblical Aramaic, but in biblical Hebrew it especially refers to wearing out such things as garments.<br>
 <a name="fn286" href="dan.htm#fnB286"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn </b> (7:25) <i>Aram</i> "times and law." The present translation is based on the understanding that the expression is a hendiadys.<br>
 <a name="fn287" href="dan.htm#fnB287"><sup>33</sup></a><b>sn</b> (7:25)  Although the form <i>times </i>is vocalized in the MT as a plural, it probably should be regarded as a dual. The Masoretes may have been influenced here by the fact that in late Aramaic (and Syriac) the dual forms fall out of use. The meaning would thus be three and a half "times."<br>
 <a name="fn288" href="dan.htm#fnB288"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (7:28)  <i>Aram</i> "brightness was changing on me."<br>
 <a name="fn289" href="dan.htm#fnB289"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:1)  Dan 8:1 marks the switch from Aramaic (= 2:4b-7:28) back to Hebrew as the language in which the book is written in its present form. The remainder of the book from this point on (8:1-12:13) is in Hebrew. The bilingual nature of the book has been variously explained, but it most likely has to do with the transmission history of the book.<br>
 <a name="fn290" href="dan.htm#fnB290"><sup>2</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:1)  The <i>third year of King Belshazzar's reign</i> would have been ca. 551 B.C. Daniel would have been approximately 69 years old at the time of this vision. <br>
 <a name="fn291" href="dan.htm#fnB291"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:1) <i>Heb</i> "in the beginning."<br>
 <a name="fn292" href="dan.htm#fnB292"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:2)  <i>Susa</i> (Heb. <i>Shushan</i>), located some 230 miles east of Babylon, was a winter residence for Persian kings during the Achaemenid period. The language of v. 2 seems to suggest that Daniel may not have been physically present at Susa, but only saw himself there in the vision. However, the Hebrew is difficult, and some have concluded that the first four words of v. 2 in the MT are a later addition (cf. Theodotion).<br>
 <a name="fn293" href="dan.htm#fnB293"><sup>5</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:2)  The word <i>citadel </i>(Heb.<i> bira</i> = "castle, palace") usually refers to a fortified structure within a city, but here it is in apposition to the city name Susa and therefore has a broader reference to the entire city (against this view, however, see BDB 108).<br>
 <a name="fn294" href="dan.htm#fnB294"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:2)  The word <i>canal</i> (Heb. <i>`ubal</i> = "stream, river") is a relatively rare word in biblical Hebrew, found only here and in vv. 3 and 6. The Ulai was apparently a sizable artificial canal in Susa, and not a river in the ordinary sense of that word.<br>
 <a name="fn295" href="dan.htm#fnB295"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:3) <i>Heb</i> "one." The Hebrew numerical adjective occasionally functions like an English indefinite article. See GKC &#167;125.<i>b</i>.<br>
 <a name="fn296" href="dan.htm#fnB296"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:3)  <i>Heb</i> "high" (also "higher" later in this verse).<br>
 <a name="fn297" href="dan.htm#fnB297"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:4)  Or "beast."<br>
 <a name="fn298" href="dan.htm#fnB298"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:4)  In the Hiphil the Hebrew verb <i>gdl </i>(to make great; to magnify) can have either a positive or a negative sense. For the former, used especially of God, see Ps 126:2, 3; Joel 2:21. In this chapter (8:4, 8, 11, 25) the word has a pejorative sense, describing the self-glorification of this king. The sense seems to be that of vainly assuming one's own superiority through deliberate hubris.<br>
 <a name="fn299" href="dan.htm#fnB299"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:5) <i>Heb</i> "a he-goat of the goats."<br>
 <a name="fn300" href="dan.htm#fnB300"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:5)  Or "of the whole earth."<br>
 <a name="fn301" href="dan.htm#fnB301"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:5)  <i>Heb</i> "a horn of vision" [or, "conspicuousness"], i.e., "a conspicuous horn."<br>
 <a name="fn302" href="dan.htm#fnB302"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:7)  <i>Heb</i> "he hurled him." The referents of both pronouns (the male goat and the ram) have been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn303" href="dan.htm#fnB303"><sup>15</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:7)  The <i>goat</i> of Daniel's vision represents Greece; the <i>large horn</i> is Alexander the Great. The <i>ram</i> stands for Media-Persia. Alexander's rapid conquest of the Persians involved three battles of major significance which he won against overwhelming odds: Granicus (334 B.C.), Isus (333 B.C.), and Gaugemela (331 B.C.).<br>
 <a name="fn304" href="dan.htm#fnB304"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:8)  The word "horns" is not in the Hebrew text, but is implied.<br>
 <a name="fn305" href="dan.htm#fnB305"><sup>17</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:8)  The <i>four conspicuous ones</i> refer to Alexander's successors. After his death, Alexander's empire was carved up among four of his generals: Cassander, who took Macedonia and Greece; Lysimachus, who took Thrace and parts of Asia Minor; Seleucus, who took Syria and territory to its east; and Ptolemy, who took control of Egypt.<br>
 <a name="fn306" href="dan.htm#fnB306"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:8)  Or "the heavens." The same Hebrew term, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;y]m^v*</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">v*m^y]&lt;</FONT>), may be translated "heavens" or "sky" depending on the context.<br>
 <a name="fn307" href="dan.htm#fnB307"><sup>19</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:9)  This <i>small horn</i> is Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who controlled the Seleucid kingdom from ca. 175-164 B.C. Antiochus was extremely hostile toward the Jews and persecuted them mercilessly.<br>
 <a name="fn308" href="dan.htm#fnB308"><sup>20</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:9)  The expression <i>the land of beauty</i> (Heb. <i>hassebi </i>= "the beauty") is a cryptic reference to the land of Israel. Cf. 11:16, 41, where it is preceded by the word <i>`eres</i> ("land").<br>
 <a name="fn309" href="dan.htm#fnB309"><sup>21</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:11)  The <i>prince of the host</i> is an expression that apparently refers to God. <br>
 <a name="fn310" href="dan.htm#fnB310"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:11)  Or perhaps "and by him," referring to Antiochus rather than to God.<br>
 <a name="fn311" href="dan.htm#fnB311"><sup>23</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:11)  Here the <i>sanctuary</i> is a reference to the temple of God in Jerusalem.<br>
 <a name="fn312" href="dan.htm#fnB312"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tc</b> (8:12)  The present translation reads <i>useba'ah nittan</i> for the MT <i>wesaba' tinnaten</i>. The context suggests a perfect rather than an imperfect verb.<br>
 <a name="fn313" href="dan.htm#fnB313"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:12)  The phrase <i>in the course of transgression </i>is difficult. It could mean "due to transgression," referring to the failures of the Jews, but this is not likely since it is not a point made elsewhere in the book. The phrase more probably refers to the transgressions against the Jews epitomized by Antiochus.<br>
 <a name="fn314" href="dan.htm#fnB314"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tc</b> (8:12)  A couple of medieval Hebrew MSS and the LXX have a passive verb here: "truth was hurled to the ground."<br>
 <a name="fn315" href="dan.htm#fnB315"><sup>27</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:12)  <i>Truth</i> here probably refers to the Torah. According to 1 Macc 1:56, Antiochus initiated destruction of the sacred books of the Jews.<br>
 <a name="fn316" href="dan.htm#fnB316"><sup>28</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:13)  The <i>holy one</i> referred to here is presumably an angel. Cf. 4:13[10], 23 [20].<br>
 <a name="fn317" href="dan.htm#fnB317"><sup>29</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:14)  The language of <i>evenings and mornings</i> is reminiscent of the creation account in Genesis 1. Since "evening and morning" is the equivalent of a day, the reference here would be to 2,300 days. However, some interpreters understand the reference to be to the evening sacrifice and the morning sacrifice, in which case the reference would be to only 1,150 days. Either way, the event that marked the commencement of this period is unclear. The event that marked the conclusion of the period is the rededication of the temple in Jerusalem following the atrocious and sacrilegious acts that Antiochus implemented. This took place on December 25, 165 B.C. The Jewish celebration of Hannukah each year commemorates this victory.<br>
 <a name="fn318" href="dan.htm#fnB318"><sup>30</sup></a><b>sn</b> (8:16)  The only angels whose names are given in the OT are <i>Gabriel</i> (Dan 8:16; 9:21; cf. Luke 1:19, 26) and Michael (Dan 10:13, 21; 12:1; cf. Jude 9; Rev 12:7). The name Gabriel means in Hebrew "man of God," and Michael means "who is like God?"<br>
 <a name="fn319" href="dan.htm#fnB319"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:19)  <i>Heb</i> "for it"; the referent (the vision Daniel saw in vv. 8-12; cf. also v. 13) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn320" href="dan.htm#fnB320"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn </b> (8:21) <i>Heb</i> "the he-goat, the buck." The expression is odd, and the second word may be an explanatory gloss.<br>
 <a name="fn321" href="dan.htm#fnB321"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:22)  <i>Heb</i> "the broken one." The word "horn" has been supplied in the translation to clarify the referent.<br>
 <a name="fn322" href="dan.htm#fnB322"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tc</b> (8:23)  The present translation reads <i>happes&#180;im</i> for the MT <i>happose&#180;im</i>. While the MT is understandable (cf. NIV, "when rebels have become completely wicked"), the filling up of transgressions is a familiar OT expression (cf. Gen 15:16) and fits this context well. Cf. the LXX, Theodotion, the Vg, and the Syriac.<br>
 <a name="fn323" href="dan.htm#fnB323"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn</b> (8:27)  Heb., <i>nihyeti.</i> The meaning of the word is not entirely clear. <i>Hayah</i> normally has meanings such as "to be" or "become." Here, however, it describes Daniel's emotional and physical response to the enigmatic vision that he has seen. It is parallel to the following verb, which refers to illness, and seems to refer to a state of utter exhaustion due to the amazing things that Daniel has just seen. The LXX lacks the word.<br>
 <a name="fn324" href="dan.htm#fnB324"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:1)  The identity of this <i>Darius</i> is a major problem in correlating the biblical material with the extra-biblical records of this period. Most modern scholars treat the reference as a mistaken allusion to Darius Hystaspes (ca. 522-446 B.C.). Others have maintained instead that this name is a reference to the Persian governor Gubaru. Still others understand the reference to be to the Persian king Cyrus (cf. 6:28, where the <i>vav</i> may be understood as <i>vav explicativum</i>, meaning "even"). Under either of these latter two interpretations, the <i>first year of Darius</i> would have been ca. 538 B.C. Daniel would have been approximately eighty-two years old at this time.<br>
 <a name="fn325" href="dan.htm#fnB325"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tc</b> (9:1)  The LXX reads "Xerxes." This is the reading used by the NIV. Most other English versions retain the Hebrew name "Ahasuerus."<br>
 <a name="fn326" href="dan.htm#fnB326"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tc</b> (9:1)  The present translation follows the MT in reading a Hophal (i.e., passive). Theodotion, the Syriac, and the Vg all presuppose the Hiphil (i.e., active). Even though this is the only occurrence of the Hophal of this verb in the Bible, there is no need to emend the vocalization to the Hiphil. <br>

 <a name="fn345" href="dan.htm#fnB345"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:21)  The Hebrew expression <i>mu&#180;ap bi&#180;ap</i> is very difficult. The issue is whether the verb derives from <i>&#180;up</i> ("to fly") or from <i>y&#180;p</i> ("to be weary"). Many ancient versions and modern commentators take the first of these possibilities and understand the reference to be to the swift flight of the angel Gabriel in his coming to Daniel. The words more likely refer to the extreme weariness, not of the angel, but of Daniel. Cf. 7:28; 8:27; 10:8-9, 16-17.<br>
 <a name="fn346" href="dan.htm#fnB346"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:23)  This sentence is perhaps a compound hendiadys ("give serious consideration to the revelatory vision").<br>

 <a name="fn349" href="dan.htm#fnB349"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tc</b> (9:24)  The present translation reads the Qere (singular), rather than the<i> </i>Kethib (plural).<br>
 <a name="fn350" href="dan.htm#fnB350"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:24)  The Hebrew phrase <i>lekalle'</i> is apparently a metaplastic spelling of the root <i>klh</i> ("to complete, finish"), rather than a form of <i>kl' </i>("to shut up, restrain"), as has sometimes been supposed.<br>
 <a name="fn351" href="dan.htm#fnB351"><sup>28</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:24)  The act of sealing in the OT is a sign of authentication. Cf. 1 Kgs 21:8; Jer 32:10, 11, 44.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (9:25)  The MT indicates disjunction at this point, which would make a messianic interpretation of the passage difficult, if not impossible. In light of the reference in v. 26 to the sixty-two weeks as a unit, it seems preferable to understand the disjunction as indicated above. The translation of the entire passage (vv. 24-27) presented here departs occasionally from the Masoretic understanding.<br>
 <a name="fn356" href="dan.htm#fnB356"><sup>33</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:26)  The expression <i>have nothing</i> is difficult. Presumably it refers to an absence of support or assistance for the anointed one at the time of his "cutting off." The KJV rendering "but not for himself," apparently suggesting a vicarious death, cannot be defended.<br>
 <a name="fn357" href="dan.htm#fnB357"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tc</b> (9:26)  Some witnesses (e.g., the Syriac) understand a passive verb and the preposition <i>&#180;im</i> ("with) rather than the noun <i>&#180;am</i> ("people"), thus reading "the city and the sanctuary will be destroyed with the coming prince."<br>
 <a name="fn358" href="dan.htm#fnB358"><sup>35</sup></a><b>sn</b> (9:26)  <i>Flood</i> here is hypocatastic for sudden destruction.<br>

 <a name="fn360" href="dan.htm#fnB360"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn</b> (9:27)  The meaning of the Hebrew word <i>kenap</i> ("wing") is unclear here. The LXX and Theodotion have "the temple." Some English versions (e.g., NAB, NIV) take this to mean "a wing of the temple," but this is not clear.<br>
 <a name="fn361" href="dan.htm#fnB361"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:1)  This chapter begins the final unit in the Book of Daniel, consisting of chapters 10-12. The traditional chapter division to some extent obscures the relationship of these chapters.<br>

 <b>sn</b> (10:1)  Cyrus' <i>third year</i> would have been ca. 536 B.C. Daniel would have been approximately eighty-four years old at this time.<br>
 <a name="fn363" href="dan.htm#fnB363"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:1)  The meaning of the Hebrew word <i>saba'</i> is uncertain. The word most often refers to an army or warfare. It may also mean "hard service," and many commentators take that to be the sense here (i.e., "the service was great"). The present translation assumes the reference to be to the spiritual conflicts described, for example, in 10:16-11:1.<br>
 <a name="fn364" href="dan.htm#fnB364"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:2)  <i>Heb</i> "three weeks of days." The inclusion of "days" here and in v. 3 is perhaps intended to call attention to the fact that these weeks are very different in nature from those of chap. 9, which are "weeks of years."<br>

 <a name="fn366" href="dan.htm#fnB366"><sup>6</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:3)  Anointing oneself with <i>oil</i> was a common OT practice due to the severity of the Middle Eastern sun (cf. Ps 121:6). It was also associated with rejoicing (e.g., Prov 27:9) and was therefore usually not practiced during a period of mourning.<br>
 <a name="fn367" href="dan.htm#fnB367"><sup>7</sup></a><b>sn</b> (10:4)  Twenty-four days would be about three and a half weeks, a measure of time that takes on interest in light of its similarity to the time mentioned in Dan 9:27.<br>

 <a name="fn369" href="dan.htm#fnB369"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (10:4)  The Hebrew text has <i>Hiddaqel</i>. "Tigris" appears here in the LXX, since it is the Greek name for this river. Elsewhere in the OT "the great river" refers to the Euphrates (e.g., Gen 15:18; Josh<b> </b>1:4), leading some interpreters to think that a mistake is involved in using the expression to refer to the Tigris. But it is doubtful that the expression had such a fixed and limited usage. The Syriac, however, does render the word here by "Euphrates" (Syr., <i>perat</i>), in keeping with biblical usage elsewhere.<br>
 <a name="fn370" href="dan.htm#fnB370"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn </b> (10:5) <i>Heb</i> "I lifted up my eyes."<br>

The Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">p*z</FONT> ("refined gold" or "pure gold") is more common in the OT than <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">aWp*z</FONT>, and some scholars emend the text of Dan 10:5 to read this word.

 <a name="fn394" href="dan.htm#fnB394"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn</b> (11:1)  The antecedent of the pronoun <i>I</i> is the angel, not Daniel. The traditional chapter division at this point, and the presence of a chronological note in the verse similar to ones used elsewhere in the book to position Daniel's activities in relation to imperial affairs, sometimes lead to confusion on this matter.<br>
 <a name="fn395" href="dan.htm#fnB395"><sup>10</sup></a><b>sn</b> (11:2)  Perhaps these <i>three more kings</i> are Cambyses (ca. 530-522 B.C.), Pseudo-Smerdis (ca. 522 B.C.), and Darius I Hystaspes (ca. 522-486 B.C.).<br>
 <a name="fn396" href="dan.htm#fnB396"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn</b> (11:2)  This <i>fourth king</i> is Xerxes I (ca. 486-465 B.C.). The following reference to <i>one of his chiefs</i> apparently has in view Seleucus Nicator.<br>
 <a name="fn397" href="dan.htm#fnB397"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:2)  The text is difficult. The Hebrew has here <i>`et</i>, the marker of a definite direct object. As it stands, this would suggest the meaning that "he will arouse everyone, that is, the kingdom of Greece." The context, however, seems to suggest the idea that this Persian king will arouse in hostility against Greece the constituent elements of his own empire. This requires supplying the word "against," which is not actually present in the Hebrew text.<br>
 <a name="fn398" href="dan.htm#fnB398"><sup>13</sup></a><b>sn</b> (11:3)  The <i>powerful king</i> mentioned here is Alexander the Great (ca. 336-323 B.C.).<br>

The following reference to <i>one of his chiefs</i> apparently has in view Seleucus I Nicator (ca. 311-280 B.C.). Throughout the remainder of chap. 11 the expressions "king of the south" and "king of the north" repeatedly occur. It is clear, however, that these terms are being used generically to describe the Ptolemaic king (i.e., "of the south") or the Seleucid king (i.e., "of the north") who happens to be in power at any particular time. The specific identity of these kings can be established more or less successfully by a comparison of this chapter with the available extra-biblical records that discuss the history of the intertestamental period. In the following notes the generally accepted identifications are briefly mentioned.<br>
 <a name="fn401" href="dan.htm#fnB401"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (11:5)  <i>Heb</i> "princes."<br>

 <a name="fn436" href="dan.htm#fnB436"><sup>51</sup></a><b>sn</b> (11:30)  The name <i>Kittim</i> has various designations in extra-biblical literature. It can refer to a location on the island of Cyprus, or more generally to the island itself, or it can be an inclusive term to refer to parts of the Mediterranean world that lay west of the Middle East (e.g., Rome). For <i>ships of Kittim</i> the Greek OT (LXX) has "Romans." A number of times in the Dead Sea Scrolls the word is used in reference to the Romans.<br>
 <a name="fn437" href="dan.htm#fnB437"><sup>52</sup></a><b>sn</b> (11:30)  This is apparently a reference to the Roman forces, led by Gaius Popilius Laenas, which confronted Antiochus when he came to Egypt and demanded that he withdraw or face the wrath of Rome.

 <a name="fn447" href="dan.htm#fnB447"><sup>62</sup></a><b>sn</b> (11:36)  The identity of this <i>king</i> is problematic. If vv. 36-45 continue the description of Antiochus Epiphanes, the account must be viewed as erroneous, since the details do not match what is known of Antiochus' latter days. Most modern scholars take this view, concluding that this section was written just shortly before the death of Antiochus and that the writer erred on several key points as he tried to predict what would follow the events of his own day. Conservative scholars, however, usually understand the reference to shift at this point to an eschatological figure, <i>viz</i>., the Antichrist. The chronological gap that this would presuppose to be in the narrative is not necessarily a problem, since by all accounts there are many chronological gaps throughout the chapter, as the historical figures intended by such expressions as "king of the north" and "king of the south" repeatedly shift.<br>
 <a name="fn448" href="dan.htm#fnB448"><sup>63</sup></a><b>tn </b> (11:36) <i>Heb</i> "has been done." The Hebrew verb used here is the perfect of certitude, emphasizing the certainty of fulfillment.<br>
