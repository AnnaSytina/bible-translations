 <b>tc</b> (1:1)  The translation follows the MT. The LXX reads "a man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite"; this is followed by a number of recent English translations. It is possible the MT reading <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yp!ox</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">xop!&lt;</FONT>) arose from dittography of the <i>mem</i> at the beginning of the following word.<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="1sa.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:3) <i>Heb</i> "from days to days."<br>
 <a name="fn2" href="1sa.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  The exact sense of the Hebrew word <FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">&aacute;appayim</FONT> ("two faces") is not certain here. It most likely is used with the preceding expression ("one portion of two faces") to mean a portion double that normally received. Although evidence for this use of the word derives primarily from Aramaic rather than from Hebrew usage, it provides an understanding that fits the context here better than other suggestions for the word do. The meaning "double" is therefore adopted in the present translation. Other possibilities for the meaning of the word include the following: "heavily" (cf. Vulg., <i>tristis</i>) and "worthy" or "choice" (cf. KJV and Targum). Some scholars have followed the LXX here, emending the word to <FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">&aacute;epes</FONT> and translating it as "but" or "however." This seems unnecessary. The translators of the LXX may simply have been struggling to make sense of the word rather than following a Hebrew text that was different from the MT here.<br>
 <a name="fn3" href="1sa.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:5) <i>Heb</i> "for Hannah he loved." Repetition of the proper name would seem redundant in contemporary English, so the pronoun ("her") has been used in the translation. The translation also adds the adverb "especially" to clarify the meaning of the text. Without this addition one might get the impression that only Hannah, not Peninnah, was loved by her husband. But the point of the text is that Hannah was his favorite.<br>
 <a name="fn4" href="1sa.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:5) <i>Heb</i> "and the LORD had closed her womb." So also in v. 6. The disjunctive clause provides supplemental information that is pertinent to the story.<br>
 <a name="fn5" href="1sa.htm#fnB5"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:6) <i>Heb</i> "and her rival wife grieved her, even [with] grief so as to worry her." <br>
 <a name="fn6" href="1sa.htm#fnB6"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  The MT has a masculine form of the verb here (<FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">ya&#180;aseh</FONT>, "he used to do"); the subject in that case would presumably be Elkanah. But this leads to an abrupt change of subject in the following part of the verse, where the subject is the rival wife who caused Hannah anxiety. In light of v. 6 one expects the statement of v. 7 to refer to the ongoing actions of the rival wife: "she used to behave in this way year after year." Some scholars have proposed retaining the masculine form but changing the vocalization of the verb so as to read a Niphal rather than a Qal (i.e., <FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">ye&#180;aseh</FONT>, "so it used to be done"). But the problem here is lack of precedent for such a use of the Niphal of this verb. It seems best in light of the context to understand the reference to be to Hannah's rival Peninnah and to read here with the Syriac Peshitta a feminine form of the verb ("she used to do"). In the translation the referent (Peninnah) has been specified for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn7" href="1sa.htm#fnB7"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:7) <i>Heb</i> "she"; the referent (Hannah) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn8" href="1sa.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:7) <i>Heb</i> "she"; the referent (Peninnah) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="1sa.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:8) <i>Heb</i> "why is your heart displeased?"<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="1sa.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>sn </b> (1:8) Like the number seven, the number <i>ten</i> is sometimes used in the OT as an ideal number (see, for example, Dan 1:20, Zech 8:23). <br>
 <a name="fn11" href="1sa.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tc </b> (1:9) The LXX adds "and stood before the Lord," but this is probably a textual expansion due to the terseness of the statement in the Hebrew text.<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="1sa.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:9) Or perhaps, "on his throne." See Jo&uuml;on-Muraoka, <i>Grammar</i>, &#167;137.f.<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="1sa.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:10) <i>Heb</i> "she [was in] bitterness of soul."<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="1sa.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:10) <i>Heb</i> "and weeping, she was weeping." The infinitive absolute emphasizes the extent of her sorrow. The imperfect verbal form emphasizes the continuation of the action in past time.<br>
 <a name="fn15" href="1sa.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:11) <i>Heb</i> "if looking you look." The expression can refer, as here, to looking favorably upon another, in this case with compassion.<br>
 <a name="fn16" href="1sa.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  <i>Heb</i> "handmaid." The use of this term (translated two more times in this verse and once each in vv. 16, 17 simply as "servant" for stylistic reasons) is an expression of humility.<br>
 <a name="fn17" href="1sa.htm#fnB17"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:11) <i>Heb</i> "seed of men."<br>
 <a name="fn18" href="1sa.htm#fnB18"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:11) <i>Heb</i> "a razor will not go up upon his head."<br>
 <a name="fn19" href="1sa.htm#fnB19"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tc </b> (1:12) <i>Heb</i> "before." Many medieval Hebrew manuscripts read "to." <br>
 <a name="fn20" href="1sa.htm#fnB20"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:14) <i>Heb</i> "Eli." The pronoun ("he") has been used in the translation in keeping with contemporary English style.<br>
 <a name="fn21" href="1sa.htm#fnB21"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:15) <i>Heb</i> "No."<br>
 <a name="fn22" href="1sa.htm#fnB22"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:15) <i>Heb</i> "I am a woman difficult of spirit." The LXX has "for whom the day is difficult," apparently mistaking the Hebrew word for "spirit" (<FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">ruah</FONT>) to be the word for "day" (<FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">yom</FONT>). <br>
 <a name="fn23" href="1sa.htm#fnB23"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:15) <i>Heb</i> "before."<br>
 <a name="fn24" href="1sa.htm#fnB24"><sup>25</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:16) <i>Heb</i> "daughter of worthlessness."<br>
 <a name="fn25" href="1sa.htm#fnB25"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tc </b> (1:18) Several medieval Hebrew MSS and the Syriac Peshitta lack the words "and got something to eat."<br>
 <a name="fn26" href="1sa.htm#fnB26"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:19) <i>Heb</i> "knew."<br>
 <a name="fn27" href="1sa.htm#fnB27"><sup>28</sup></a><b>sn </b> (1:19) The Lord "remembered" her in the sense of granting her earlier request for a child. The Hebrew verb is often used in the OT for considering the needs or desires of people with favor and kindness.<br>
 <a name="fn28" href="1sa.htm#fnB28"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:20) <i> Heb</i> "because from the LORD I asked him." The name "Samuel" sounds like the Hebrew verb translated "asked."<b> </b>The explanation of the meaning of the name "Samuel" that is provided in v. 20 is not a strict etymology. It seems to suggest that the first part of the name is derived from the Hebrew root <FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">s&aacute;l</FONT> ("to ask"), but the consonants do not support this. Nor is it likely that the name comes from the root <FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">sm&#180;</FONT> ("to hear"), for the same reason. It more probably derives from <FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">sem</FONT> ("name"), so that "Samuel" means "name of God." Verse 20 therefore does not set forth a linguistic explanation of the meaning of the name, but rather draws a parallel between similar sounds. This figure of speech is known as paronomasia.<br>
 <a name="fn29" href="1sa.htm#fnB29"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:22) The disjunctive clause is contrastive here.<br>
 <a name="fn30" href="1sa.htm#fnB30"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:23) <i>Heb</i> "what is good in your eyes."<br>
 <a name="fn31" href="1sa.htm#fnB31"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:23) <i>Heb</i> "establish his word." This apparently refers to the promise inherent in Eli's priestly blessing (see v. 17).<br>
 <a name="fn32" href="1sa.htm#fnB32"><sup>33</sup></a><b>sn </b> (1:24) The <i>ephah</i> was a standard dry measure in OT times; it was the equivalent of one-tenth of the OT measure known as a homer. The ephah was equal to approximately one-half to two-thirds of a bushel.<br>
 <a name="fn33" href="1sa.htm#fnB33"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tc </b> (1:24) <i>Heb</i> "and the boy was a boy." If the MT is correct the meaning apparently is that the boy was quite young at the time of these events. On the other hand, some scholars have suspected a textual problem, emending the text to read either "and the boy was with them" (so LXX) or "and the boy was with her" (a conjectural emendation). In spite of the difficulty it seems best to stay with the MT here.<br>
 <a name="fn34" href="1sa.htm#fnB34"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:28) <i>Heb</i> "he," apparently referring to Samuel. A few medieval manuscripts and some ancient versions take verb as plural.<br>
 <a name="fn35" href="1sa.htm#fnB35"><sup>1</sup></a><b>sn </b> (2:1) Horns of animals have always functioned for them both as offensive and as defensive weapons. As a figure of speech the horn is therefore often used in the Bible as a symbol of human strength (see also in v. 10). The allusion in v. 1 to the <i>horn</i> being lifted <i>high</i> suggests a picture of an animal elevating its head in a display of strength or virility.<br>
 <a name="fn36" href="1sa.htm#fnB36"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:1) <i>Heb</i> "my mouth opens wide against."<br>
 <a name="fn37" href="1sa.htm#fnB37"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:1) <i>Heb</i> "for I rejoice in your deliverance."<br>
 <a name="fn38" href="1sa.htm#fnB38"><sup>4</sup></a><b>sn </b> (2:2) In this context God's holiness refers primarily to his sovereignty and incomparability. He is unique and distinct from all other so-called gods.<br>
 <a name="fn39" href="1sa.htm#fnB39"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:2) The LXX has "and there is none <i>righteous</i> like our God." The Hebrew term translated "rock" refers to a rocky cliff where one can seek refuge from enemies. Here the metaphor depicts God as a protector of his people. <br>
 <a name="fn40" href="1sa.htm#fnB40"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:3) <i>Heb</i> "proudly, proudly." If MT is original, the repetition of the word is for emphasis, stressing the arrogance of those addressed. However, a few medieval Hebrew manuscripts and some other textual witnesses do not reflect the repetition, suggesting that the Hebrew text may be dittographic.<br>
 <a name="fn41" href="1sa.htm#fnB41"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tc </b> (2:3) The MT (Qere) reads "and by him actions are weighed." The translation assumes that reading of the the Qere ("and by him"), which is supported by many medieval Hebrew MSS, is correct, rather than the reading of the Kethib, "and not."<br>
 <a name="fn42" href="1sa.htm#fnB42"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tc </b> (2:4) Against <i>BHS</i> but with the MT, the preposition should be taken with what follows rather than with what precedes. For<i> </i>this sense of the preposition see Job 25:5.<br>
 <a name="fn43" href="1sa.htm#fnB43"><sup>9</sup></a><b>sn </b> (2:4) The number <i>seven</i> is used here in an ideal sense. Elsewhere in the OT having seven children is evidence of fertility as a result of God's blessing on the family. See, for example, Jer 15:9, Ruth 4:15.<br>
 <a name="fn44" href="1sa.htm#fnB44"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:4) Or "languishes." <br>
 <a name="fn45" href="1sa.htm#fnB45"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:8) The imperfect verbal form, which is parallel to the participle in the preceding line, is best understood here as indicating what typically happens. <br>
 <a name="fn46" href="1sa.htm#fnB46"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:8) <i>Heb</i> "a seat of honor."<br>
 <a name="fn47" href="1sa.htm#fnB47"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:9) <i>Heb</i> "guards the feet of." The expression means that God watches over and protects the godly in all of their activities and movements. The imperfect verbal forms in v. 9 are understood as indicating what is typically true. Another option is to translate them with the future tense. See v. 10b.<br>
 <a name="fn48" href="1sa.htm#fnB48"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tc </b> (2:9) The translation follows the Qere<i> </i>and many medieval Hebrew MSS in reading the plural ("his holy ones") rather than the singular ("his holy one") of the Kethib.<br>
 <a name="fn49" href="1sa.htm#fnB49"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:10) The imperfect verbal forms in this line and in the next two lines are understood as indicating what is typically true. Another option is to translate them with the future tense. See v. 10b.<br>
 <a name="fn50" href="1sa.htm#fnB50"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tc </b> (2:10) The translation follows the Qere, many medieval Hebrew manuscripts, the Syriac Peshitta, and the Vulgate in reading the plural ("his adversaries") rather than the singular ("his adversary") of the Kethib.<br>
 <a name="fn51" href="1sa.htm#fnB51"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:10) The Hebrew preposition here has the sense of "from within." <br>
 <a name="fn52" href="1sa.htm#fnB52"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:10) The imperfect verbal forms in this and the next line are understood as indicating what is anticipated and translated with the future tense, because at the time of Hannah's prayer Israel did not yet have a king. <br>
 <a name="fn53" href="1sa.htm#fnB53"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:10)  <i>Heb</i> "the horn," here a metaphor for power or strength.<br>
 <a name="fn54" href="1sa.htm#fnB54"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tc </b> (2:10) The LXX greatly expands v. 10 with an addition that seems to be taken from Jer 9:23-24.<br>

 <a name="fn57" href="1sa.htm#fnB57"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:12) <i>Heb</i> "they did not know the LORD." The verb here has the semantic nuance "recognize the authority of." Eli's sons obviously knew who the Lord was; they served in his sanctuary. But they did not recognize his moral authority.<br>
 <a name="fn58" href="1sa.htm#fnB58"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:13) <i>Heb</i> "the habit of the priests with the people [was this]." <br>
 <a name="fn59" href="1sa.htm#fnB59"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn </b> (2:13) The Hebrew word occurs only twice in the OT, here and again in v. 14. Its exact meaning is not entirely clear, although from the context it appears to be a sacrificial tool used for retrieving things from boiling water.<br>
 <a name="fn60" href="1sa.htm#fnB60"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:14)  <i>Heb</i> "to all Israel."<br>

 <a name="fn65" href="1sa.htm#fnB65"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:20)  The MT has a masculine verb here, but in light of the context the reference must be to Hannah. It is possible that the text of the MT is incorrect here (cf. the ancient versions), in which case the text should be changed to read either a passive participle or better, the third feminine singular of the verb. If the MT is correct here, perhaps the masculine is to be understood in a non-specific and impersonal way, allowing for a feminine antecedent. In any case, the syntax of the MT is unusual here. <br>
 <a name="fn66" href="1sa.htm#fnB66"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:20) <i>Heb</i> "his."<br>
 <a name="fn67" href="1sa.htm#fnB67"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:21) <i>Heb</i> "with the LORD."<br>

 <a name="fn70" href="1sa.htm#fnB70"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tc </b> (2:23) For "these" the LXX has "of the Lord" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kuriou</FONT>), perhaps through the influence of the final phrase of v. 24 ("the people of the LORD"). Somewhat less likely is the view that the MT reading is due to a distorted dittography of the first word of v. 24. The Vulgate lacks the word.<br>
 <a name="fn71" href="1sa.htm#fnB71"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:24) <i>Heb</i> "no."<br>

The singular may be the correct reading; the verb "you have honored" later in the verse is singular even in the MT. However, it is more probable that the Lord here refers to Eli and his sons. Note the plural in the second half of the verse ("you have made yourselves fat").<br>
 <a name="fn77" href="1sa.htm#fnB77"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:29) <i>Heb </i>"which I commanded, dwelling place." The noun is functioning as an adverbial accusative in relation to the verb. Since God's dwelling place/sanctuary is in view, the pronoun "my" is supplied in the translation.<br>
 <a name="fn78" href="1sa.htm#fnB78"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:30) The infinitive absolute appears before the finite verb for emphasis. <br>

Apparently the meaning is that they will be cut off in the prime of their life without reaching old age.

 <a name="fn102" href="1sa.htm#fnB102"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tc </b> (3:13) The translation follows the LXX <FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">&aacute;elohim</FONT> ("God") rather than the MT <FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">lahem</FONT> ("to them"). The MT seems to mean "they were bringing a curse on themselves." But this meaning is problematic in part because the verb <FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">qll</FONT> means "to curse," not "to bring a curse on," and in part because it takes an accusative object rather than the equivalent of a dative. This is one of the so-called <i>tiqqune sopherim</i>, or "emendations of the scribes." Why would the ancient copyists alter the original statement about Eli's sons cursing <i>God</i> to the less objectionable statement that they brought a curse on <i>themselves</i>. Some argue that the scribes were concerned that such a direct and blasphemous affront against God could occur without an immediate response of judgment from God. Therefore they changed the text by deleting two letters (<FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">alef</FONT> and <FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">yod</FONT>) from the word for "God," with the result that the text then read "to them." If this ancient scribal claim is accepted as accurate, it implies that the MT here is secondary. The present translation follows the LXX (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">kakologounte" qeon</FONT>) and a few MSS of the Old Latin in reading "God" rather than the MT "to them."<br>

The translation follows the LXX. The MT apparently suffers from parablepsis, whereby a scribe's eye jumped from the first occurrence of the expression "the LORD has anointed you" to the second occurrence of this expression at the end of v. 1.

However, it seems best to stay with the MT here even though it is difficult.<br>
 <a name="fn242" href="1sa.htm#fnB242"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tc</b> (11:1)  4QSam<sup>a</sup> and Josephus (<i>Ant.</i> 6.68-71) attest to a longer form of text at this point. The addition explains Nahash's practice of enemy mutilation, and by so doing provides a smoother transition to the following paragraph than is found in the MT. The NRSV adopts this reading, with the following English translation: "Now Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had been grievously oppressing the Gadites and the Reubenites. He would gouge out the right eye of each of them and would not grant Israel a deliverer. No one was left of the Israelites across the Jordan whose right eye Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had not gouged out. But there were seven thousand men who had escaped from the Ammonites and had entered Jabesh-gilead." This reading should not be lightly dismissed; it may in fact provide a text superior to that of the MT and the ancient versions. But the external evidence for it is so limited as to induce caution; the present translation instead follows the MT. However, for a reasonable case for including this reading in the text see the discussions in P. K. McCarter Jr., <i>I Samuel</i>, 199, and R. W. Klein, <i>1 Samuel</i>, 103.<br>

 <a name="fn280" href="1sa.htm#fnB280"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tc</b> (13:1)  The MT does not have "thirty." A number appears to have dropped out of the Hebrew text here, since as it stands the MT (literally, "a son of a year") must mean that Saul was only one year old when he began to reign! Although most LXX MSS lack the entire verse, some Greek MSS have "thirty years" here (while others have "one year"). The Syriac Peshitta has Saul's age as twenty-one. But this seems impossible to harmonize with the implied age of Saul's son Jonathan in the following verse. Taking into account the fact that in v. 2 Jonathan was old enough to be a military leader, some scholars prefer to supply in v. 1 the number forty (cf. NASB). The present translation ("thirty") is a possible but admittedly uncertain proposal.<br>
 <a name="fn281" href="1sa.htm#fnB281"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tc</b> (13:1)  The MT has "two years" here. If this number is to be accepted as correct, the meaning apparently would be that after a lapse of two years at the beginning of Saul's reign, he then went about the task of consolidating an army as described in what follows. But if the statement in v. 1 is intended to be a comprehensive report on the length of Saul's reign, the number is too small. According to Acts 13:21 Saul reigned for forty years. The NIV, taking this forty to be a round number, adds it to the "two years" of the MT and translates the number in 2 Sam 13:1 as "forty-two years." While this is an acceptable option, the present translation instead replaces the MT's "two" with the figure "forty." Admittedly the textual evidence for this decision is weak, but the same can be said of any attempt to restore sense to this difficult text. The Syriac Peshitta lacks this part of v. 1.<br>

 <a name="fn359" href="1sa.htm#fnB359"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn </b> (14:51) 1 Chr 9:35-36 indicates that Jeiel (= Abiel?) had two sons (among others) named Ner and Kish (see also 1 Sam 9:1 and 1 Chr 8:30, where some Greek manuscripts include the name Ner, though it is absent in the Hebrew text). If this Kish was the father of Saul and Ner was the father of Abner, then Saul and Abner were cousins. However, according to 1 Chr 8:33 and 9:39, Ner, not Abiel, was the father of Kish. In this case, Kish and Abner were brothers and Abner was Saul's uncle. The simplest solution to the problem is to see two men named Kish in the genealogy: Abiel (Jeiel) was the father of Ner and Kish I. Ner was the father of Abner and Kish II. Kish II was the father of Saul. The Kish mentioned in 1 Sam 9:1 was the father of Saul (v.2) and must be identified as Kish II. In this case the genealogy is "gapped," with Ner being omitted. Abiel was the grandfather of Kish II. <br>

When God makes such a decree he will not alter it or change his mind. This does not mean that God never deviates from his stated intentions or changes his mind. On the contrary, several passages describe him as changing his mind. In fact, his willingness to do so is one of his fundamental divine attributes (see Joel 2:13; Jon 4:2).

The word is found only here and in Job 38:31. Part of the problem lies in determining the root of the word. Some scholars have taken it to be from the root <FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">&#180;nd</FONT> ("to bind around"), but this assumes a metathesis of two of the letters of the root. Others take it from the root <FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">&#180;dn</FONT> with the meaning "voluptuously," but this does not seem to fit the context. It seems better to understand the word to be from the root <FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">m&#180;d</FONT> ("to totter" or "shake"). In that case it describes the fear that Agag experienced in realizing the mortal danger that he faced as he approached Samuel.

This further affects the interpretation of Agag's comment. In the MT he comes to Samuel confidently assured that the danger is over (see KJV and NIV, "Surely the bitterness of death is past"). However, it seems more likely that Agag realized that his fortunes had suddenly taken a turn for the worse and that the clemency he had enjoyed from Saul would not be his lot from Samuel. The present translation thus understands Agag to approach not confidently but in the stark realization that his death is imminent ("Surely death is bitter!").<br>

 <a name="fn437" href="1sa.htm#fnB437"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tc </b> (17:1) The content of 1 Sam 17-18, which includes the David and Goliath story, differs considerably in the LXX as compared to the MT, suggesting that this story circulated in ancient times in more than one form. The LXX for chs. 17-18 is much shorter than the MT, lacking almost half of the material (39 of a total of 88 verses). Many scholars (e.g., McCarter, Klein) think that the shorter text of the LXX is preferable to the MT, which in their view has been expanded by incorporation of later material. Other scholars (e.g., Wellhausen, Driver) conclude that the shorter Greek text (or the Hebrew text that underlies it) reflects an attempt to harmonize certain alleged inconsistencies that appear in the longer version of the story. Given the translation characteristics of the LXX elsewhere in this section, it does not seem likely that these differences are due to deliberate omission of these verses on the part of the translator. It seems more likely that the Greek translator has faithfully rendered here a Hebrew text that itself was much shorter than the MT in these chapters. Whether or not the shorter text represented by the LXX is to be preferred over the MT in 1 Sam 17-18 is a matter over which textual scholars are divided. For a helpful discussion of the major textual issues in this unit see D. Barth&eacute;lemy, D. W. Gooding, J. Lust, and E. Tov, <i>The Story of David and Goliath: Textual and Literary Criticism</i>, OBO 73 (G&ouml;ttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1986). Overall it seems preferable to stay with the MT, at least for the most part. However, the major textual differences between the LXX and the MT will be mentioned in the notes that accompany the translation so that the reader may be alert to the major problem passages.<br>

So, according to the Hebrew tradition, Goliath was about nine feet, nine inches tall. However, some Greek witnesses, Josephus, and a manuscript of 1 Samuel from Qumran read "four cubits and a span" here, that is, about six feet, nine inches. This seems more reasonable; it is likely that Goliath's height was exaggerated as the story was retold. See McCarter, <i>I Samuel</i>, 286, 291.<br>

Driver, following Kennedy, suggests a modern equivalent of about 220 pounds (100 kg). (See S. R. Driver, <i>Notes on the Hebrew Text and the Topography of the Books of Samuel</i>, 139.) Klein, taking the shekel to be equal to .403 ounces, arrives at a somewhat smaller weight of about 126 pounds (57 kg). (See R. W. Klein, <i>1 Samuel</i>, 175.)

But such an overly literal and domesticated translation of the Hebrew expression fails to capture the force of Saul's unrestrained reaction. Saul, now incensed and enraged over Jonathan's liaison with David, is actually hurling very coarse and emotionally charged words at his son. The translation of this phrase suggested by Koehler and Baumgartner is "bastard of a wayward woman" (<i>HALOT</i> 796), but this is not an expression commonly used in English. A better English approximation of the sentiments expressed here by the Hebrew phrase would be "You stupid son of a bitch!" However, sensitivity to the various public formats in which the Bible is read aloud has led to a less startling English rendering which focuses on the semantic value of Saul's utterance (i.e., the behavior of his own son Jonathan, which he viewed as both a personal and a political betrayal [= "traitor"]). But this concession should not obscure the fact that Saul is full of bitterness and frustration. That he would address his son Jonathan with such language, not to mention his apparent readiness even to kill his own son over this friendship with David (v. 33), indicates something of the extreme depth of Saul's jealousy and hatred of David.<br>

This is the idea reflected in the translations of the Syriac Peshitta and Vulgate, although it is not entirely clear whether they are reading something different from the MT or are simply paraphrasing what for them too may have been a difficult text. The LXX has "God has sold him into my hands," apparently reading <FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">makar</FONT>, "sold," for MT's <FONT FACE="SCHOLAR">nikkar</FONT>.

Most of the Old Greek MS tradition has simply "David," with no reference to his enemies. In OT imprecations such as the one found in v. 22 it is common for the speaker to direct malediction toward himself as an indication of the seriousness with which he regards the matter at hand. In other words, the speaker invites on himself dire consequences if he fails to fulfill the matter expressed in the oath. However, in the situation alluded to in v. 22 the threat actually does not come to fruition due to the effectiveness of Abigail's appeal to David in behalf of her husband Nabal. Instead, David is placated through Abigail's intervention. It therefore seems likely that the reference to "the enemies of David" in the MT of v. 22 is the result of a scribal attempt to deliver David from the implied consequences of this oath. The present translation follows the LXX rather than the MT here.<br>

 <a name="fn773" href="1sa.htm#fnB773"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn </b> (29:10) <i>Heb</i> "when you get up early in the morning and you have light, go."<br>
 <a name="fn774" href="1sa.htm#fnB774"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tc </b> (29:11) <i>Heb</i> "to go in the morning to return." With the exception of Origen and the Lucianic recension, the Old Greek tradition lacks the phrase "in the morning." The Syriac Peshitta also omits it.<br>
 <a name="fn775" href="1sa.htm#fnB775"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn </b> (30:1) The Hebrew text adds "with fire."<br>
 <a name="fn776" href="1sa.htm#fnB776"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn </b> (30:3) <i>Heb</i> "and David and his men came to the city, and look, it was burned with fire."<br>
 <a name="fn777" href="1sa.htm#fnB777"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn </b> (30:4) <i>Heb</i> "people."<br>
 <a name="fn778" href="1sa.htm#fnB778"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn </b> (30:4) <i>Heb</i> "lifted up their voice and wept."<br>
 <a name="fn779" href="1sa.htm#fnB779"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn </b> (30:4) <i>Heb</i> "until there was no longer in them strength to weep."<br>
 <a name="fn780" href="1sa.htm#fnB780"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn </b> (30:6) <i>Heb</i> "people."<br>
 <a name="fn781" href="1sa.htm#fnB781"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn </b> (30:6) <i>Heb</i> "said to stone him."<br>
 <a name="fn782" href="1sa.htm#fnB782"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn </b> (30:6) <i>Heb</i> "for bitter was the soul of all the people, each one."<br>
 <a name="fn783" href="1sa.htm#fnB783"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn </b> (30:9) <i>Heb</i> "stood." So also in v. 10.<br>
 <a name="fn784" href="1sa.htm#fnB784"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn </b> (30:12) <i>Heb</i> "his spirit returned to him."<br>
 <a name="fn785" href="1sa.htm#fnB785"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn </b> (30:14) The Hebrew text adds "with fire."<br>
 <a name="fn786" href="1sa.htm#fnB786"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn </b> (30:16) <i>Heb</i> "him"; the referent (David) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn787" href="1sa.htm#fnB787"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn </b> (30:16) <i>Heb</i> "because of all the large plunder."<br>
 <a name="fn788" href="1sa.htm#fnB788"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn </b> (30:17) <i>Heb</i> "who rode on camels and fled."<br>
 <a name="fn789" href="1sa.htm#fnB789"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn </b> (30:18) <i>Heb</i> "David." The pronoun ("he") has been substituted for the proper name in the translation for stylistic reasons.<br>
 <a name="fn790" href="1sa.htm#fnB790"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn </b> (30:19) <i>Heb</i> "there was nothing missing to them, from the small even unto the great, and unto sons and daughters, and from loot even unto all which they had taken for themselves."<br>
 <a name="fn791" href="1sa.htm#fnB791"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn </b> (30:21) <i>Heb</i> "David." The pronoun ("him") has been substituted for the proper name in the translation for stylistic reasons.<br>
 <a name="fn792" href="1sa.htm#fnB792"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tc </b> (30:22) <i>Heb</i> "with me." The singular is used rather than the plural because the group is being treated as a singular entity, in keeping with Hebrew idiom. It is not necessary to read "with us," rather than the MT "with me," although the plural can be found here in a few medieval Hebrew MSS. See also the LXX, Syriac Peshitta, and Vulgate, although these versions may simply reflect an understanding of the idiom as found in the MT rather than a different textual reading.<br>
 <a name="fn793" href="1sa.htm#fnB793"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tc </b> (30:23) This clause is difficult in the MT. The present translation accepts the text as found in the MT and understands this clause to be elliptical, with an understood verb such as "look" or "consider." On the other hand, the LXX seems to reflect a slightly different Hebrew text, reading "after" where the MT has "my brothers." The Greek translation yields the following translation: "You should not do this after the LORD has delivered us." Although the Greek reading should be taken seriously, it seems better to follow the MT here.<br>
 <a name="fn794" href="1sa.htm#fnB794"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn </b> (30:25) <i>Heb</i> "a statute and a judgment." The expression is a hendiadys.<br>
 <a name="fn795" href="1sa.htm#fnB795"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn </b> (30:26) <i>Heb</i> "blessing."<br>
 <a name="fn796" href="1sa.htm#fnB796"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn </b> (30:27) This sentence is not in the Hebrew text. It is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn797" href="1sa.htm#fnB797"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:2)  <i>Heb </i>"stuck close after."<br>
 <a name="fn798" href="1sa.htm#fnB798"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn </b> (31:2) <i>Heb</i> "the Philistines."<br>

 <a name="fn802" href="1sa.htm#fnB802"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn</b> (31:9)  <i>Heb</i> "his"; the referent (Saul) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn803" href="1sa.htm#fnB803"><sup>7</sup></a><b>sn</b> (31:10)  The Semitic goddess Ashtart (Astarte) was associated with love and war in the ancient Near East. See the note on the same term in 7:3.<br>
 <a name="fn804" href="1sa.htm#fnB804"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tc </b> (31:12) The translation follows the MT, which vocalizes the verb as a Qal. The LXX, however, treats the verb as a Hiphil, "they brought."
