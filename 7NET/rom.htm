<p><i>Paul's Desire to Visit Rome</i>
<p>
<bqverse 8>8 First of all,<a name="fnB16" href="rom_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world. 
<bqverse 9>9 For God, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, is my witness that<a name="fnB17" href="rom_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> I continuously remember you 
<bqverse 10>10  and I always ask<a name="fnB18" href="rom_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> in my prayers, if perhaps now at last I may succeed in visiting<a name="fnB19" href="rom_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> you in the will of God. 
<bqverse 11>11 For I long to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you, 
<bqverse 12>12 that is, that we may be mutually comforted by one another's faith,<a name="fnB20" href="rom_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> both yours and mine. 
<bqverse 13>13 I do not want you to be unaware,<a name="fnB21" href="rom_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB22" href="rom_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> that I often intended to come to you (and was prevented until now), so that I may have some fruit even among you, just as I already have among the rest of the Gentiles.<a name="fnB23" href="rom_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14 I am a debtor<a name="fnB24" href="rom_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a><b> </b>both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish. 
<bqverse 15>15 Thus I am eager<a name="fnB25" href="rom_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> also to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome. <a name="_Toc403221789"></a><a name="_Toc416894276"></a><a name="_Toc432265139"></a><a name="_Toc485060080"></a><a name="_Toc494013577"></a></p>
<p><i>The Power of the Gospel</i>
<p>
<bqverse 16>16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is God's power for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.<a name="fnB26" href="rom_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17 For the righteousness<a name="fnB27" href="rom_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> of God is revealed in the gospel<a name="fnB28" href="rom_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> from faith to faith,<a name="fnB29" href="rom_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> just as it is written, "<b><i>the righteous by faith will live</i></b>."<a name="fnB30" href="rom_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc403221790"></a><a name="_Toc416894277"></a><a name="_Toc432265140"></a><a name="_Toc485060081"></a><a name="_Toc494013578"></a></p>
<p><i>The Condemnation of the Unrighteous</i>
<p>
<bqverse 18>18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of people<a name="fnB31" href="rom_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> who suppress the truth by their<a name="fnB32" href="rom_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> unrighteousness,<a name="fnB33" href="rom_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19 because what can be known about God is plain to them,<a name="fnB34" href="rom_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> because God has made it plain to them. 
<bqverse 20>20 For since the creation of the world his invisible attributes--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, because they are understood through what has been made. So people<a name="fnB35" href="rom_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> are without excuse. 
<bqverse 21>21 For although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God or give him thanks, but they became futile in their thoughts and their senseless hearts<a name="fnB36" href="rom_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> were darkened. 
<bqverse 22>22 Although they claimed<a name="fnB37" href="rom_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> to be wise, they became fools 
<bqverse 23>23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for an image resembling mortal human beings<a name="fnB38" href="rom_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> or birds or four-footed animals<a name="fnB39" href="rom_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> or reptiles. <p>

<bqverse 24>24 Therefore God gave them over<a name="fnB40" href="rom_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> in the desires of their hearts to impurity, to dishonor<a name="fnB41" href="rom_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> their bodies among themselves.<a name="fnB42" href="rom_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25 They<a name="fnB43" href="rom_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> exchanged the truth of God for a lie<a name="fnB44" href="rom_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> and worshiped and served the creation<a name="fnB45" href="rom_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen. <p>

<bqverse 26>26 For this reason God gave them over to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged the natural sexual relations for unnatural ones,<a name="fnB46" href="rom_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27 and likewise the men also abandoned natural relations with women<a name="fnB47" href="rom_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> and were inflamed in their passions<a name="fnB48" href="rom_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> for one another. Men<a name="fnB49" href="rom_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> committed shameless acts with men and received in themselves the due penalty for their error. <p>

<bqverse 28>28 And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God,<a name="fnB50" href="rom_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what should not be done.<a name="fnB51" href="rom_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 29>29 They are filled<a name="fnB52" href="rom_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> with every kind of unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, malice. They are rife with<a name="fnB53" href="rom_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> envy, murder, strife, deceit, hostility. They are gossips, 
<bqverse 30>30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, contrivers of all sorts of evil, disobedient to parents, 
<bqverse 31>31 senseless, covenant-breakers,<a name="fnB54" href="rom_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> heartless, ruthless. 
<bqverse 32>32 Although they fully know<a name="fnB55" href="rom_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> God's righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die,<a name="fnB56" href="rom_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> they not only do them but also approve of those who practice them.<a name="fnB57" href="rom_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>The Condemnation of the Moralist</i>
<p><A NAME="2"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b><a name="fnB58" href="rom_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a><b> </b>Therefore<a name="fnB59" href="rom_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> you are without excuse,<a name="fnB60" href="rom_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> whoever you are,<a name="fnB61" href="rom_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> when you judge someone else.<a name="fnB62" href="rom_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> For on whatever grounds<a name="fnB63" href="rom_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> you judge another, you condemn yourself, because you who judge practice the same things. 
<bqverse 2>2 Now we know that God's judgment is in accordance with truth<a name="fnB64" href="rom_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> against those who practice such things.
<bqverse 3>3 And do you think,<a name="fnB65" href="rom_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> whoever you are, when you judge<a name="fnB66" href="rom_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> those who practice such things and yet do them yourself,<a name="fnB67" href="rom_note.htm#fn67"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> that you will escape God's judgment? 
<bqverse 4>4 Or do you have contempt for the wealth of his kindness, forbearance, and patience, and yet do not know<a name="fnB68" href="rom_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> that God's kindness leads you to repentance?
<bqverse 5>5 But because of your stubbornness<a name="fnB69" href="rom_note.htm#fn69"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath for yourselves in the day of wrath, when God's righteous judgment is revealed!<a name="fnB70" href="rom_note.htm#fn70"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 6>6 He<a name="fnB71" href="rom_note.htm#fn71"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> <b><i>will reward</i></b><a name="fnB72" href="rom_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> each one according to his works</i></b>:<a name="fnB73" href="rom_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 7>7 eternal life to those who by perseverance in good works seek glory and honor and immortality,
<bqverse 8>8 but<a name="fnB74" href="rom_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> wrath and anger to those who live in selfish ambition<a name="fnB75" href="rom_note.htm#fn75"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> and do not obey the truth but follow<a name="fnB76" href="rom_note.htm#fn76"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> unrighteousness.
<bqverse 9>9 There will be<a name="fnB77" href="rom_note.htm#fn77"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> affliction and distress on everyone<a name="fnB78" href="rom_note.htm#fn78"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> who does evil, on the Jew first and also the Greek,<a name="fnB79" href="rom_note.htm#fn79"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 10>10 but<a name="fnB80" href="rom_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, for the Jew first and also the Greek.
<bqverse 11>11 For there is no partiality with God.
<bqverse 12>12 For all who have sinned apart from the law<a name="fnB81" href="rom_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> will also perish apart from the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.
<bqverse 13>13 For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous before God, but those who do the law will be declared righteous.<a name="fnB82" href="rom_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 14>14 For whenever the Gentiles,<a name="fnB83" href="rom_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> who do not have the law, do by nature<a name="fnB84" href="rom_note.htm#fn84"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> the things required by the law,<a name="fnB85" href="rom_note.htm#fn85"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> these who do not have the law are a law to themselves.
<bqverse 15>15 They<a name="fnB86" href="rom_note.htm#fn86"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> show that the work of the law is written<a name="fnB87" href="rom_note.htm#fn87"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> in their hearts, as their conscience bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or else defend<a name="fnB88" href="rom_note.htm#fn88"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> them,<a name="fnB89" href="rom_note.htm#fn89"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>The Condemnation of the Jew</i>
<p>
<bqverse 17>17 But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law<a name="fnB93" href="rom_note.htm#fn93"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> and boast of your relationship to God<a name="fnB94" href="rom_note.htm#fn94"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 18>18 and know his will<a name="fnB95" href="rom_note.htm#fn95"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> and approve the superior things because you receive instruction from the law,<a name="fnB96" href="rom_note.htm#fn96"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 19>19 and if you are convinced<a name="fnB97" href="rom_note.htm#fn97"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
<bqverse 20>20 an educator of the senseless, a teacher of little children, because you have in the law the essential features of knowledge and of the truth-- 
<bqverse 21>21 therefore<a name="fnB98" href="rom_note.htm#fn98"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> you who teach someone else, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?
<bqverse 22>22 You who tell others not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor<a name="fnB99" href="rom_note.htm#fn99"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> idols, do you rob temples?
<bqverse 23>23 You who boast in the law dishonor God by transgressing the law!
<bqverse 24>24 For just as it is written, "<b><i>the name of God is being blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you</i></b>."<a name="fnB100" href="rom_note.htm#fn100"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 25>25  For circumcision<a name="fnB101" href="rom_note.htm#fn101"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> has its value if you practice the law, but<a name="fnB102" href="rom_note.htm#fn102"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> if you break the law,<a name="fnB103" href="rom_note.htm#fn103"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> your circumcision has become uncircumcision. 
<bqverse 26>26  Therefore if the uncircumcised man obeys<a name="fnB104" href="rom_note.htm#fn104"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> the righteous requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? 
<bqverse 27>27  And will not the physically uncircumcised man<a name="fnB105" href="rom_note.htm#fn105"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> who keeps the law judge you who, despite<a name="fnB106" href="rom_note.htm#fn106"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> the written code<a name="fnB107" href="rom_note.htm#fn107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> and circumcision, transgress the law? 
<bqverse 28>28  For a person is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision something that is outward in the flesh, 
<bqverse 29>29  but someone is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart<a name="fnB108" href="rom_note.htm#fn108"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> by the Spirit<a name="fnB109" href="rom_note.htm#fn109"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> and not by the written code.<a name="fnB110" href="rom_note.htm#fn110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> This person's<a name="fnB111" href="rom_note.htm#fn111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> praise is not from people but from God.<p>

<bqchapter 3><A NAME="3"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Therefore what advantage does the Jew have, or what is the value of circumcision? 
<bqverse 2>2  Actually, there are many advantages.<a name="fnB112" href="rom_note.htm#fn112"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> First of all,<a name="fnB113" href="rom_note.htm#fn113"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> the Jews<a name="fnB114" href="rom_note.htm#fn114"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> were entrusted with the oracles of God.<a name="fnB115" href="rom_note.htm#fn115"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>The Illustration of Justification</i>
<p><A NAME="4"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> What then shall we say that Abraham, our ancestor<a name="fnB157" href="rom_note.htm#fn157"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> according to the flesh, has discovered regarding this matter?<a name="fnB158" href="rom_note.htm#fn158"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 2>2  For if Abraham was declared righteous<a name="fnB159" href="rom_note.htm#fn159"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> by the works of the law, he has something to boast about (but not before God).
<bqverse 3>3  For what does the scripture say? "<b><i>Abraham believed God</i></b><i>,<b> and it was credited</b></i><a name="fnB160" href="rom_note.htm#fn160"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> to him as righteousness</i></b>."<a name="fnB161" href="rom_note.htm#fn161"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 4>4  Now to the one who works, his pay is not credited due to grace but due to obligation.<a name="fnB162" href="rom_note.htm#fn162"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 5>5  But to the one who does not work, but believes in the one who declares the ungodly righteous,<a name="fnB163" href="rom_note.htm#fn163"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> his faith is credited as righteousness.<p>

<bqverse 6>6  So even David himself speaks regarding the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:</p>
<br><b><i>
<bqverse 7>7 "<b><i>Blessed</i></b><a name="fnB164" href="rom_note.htm#fn164"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; </i></b><br>
<bqverse 8>8 <b><i>blessed is the one against whom the Lord will never count sin</i></b><i>.</i>"<a name="fnB165" href="rom_note.htm#fn165"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a></i></b></ul><p>
<bqverse 9>9  Is this blessedness<a name="fnB166" href="rom_note.htm#fn166"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> then for<a name="fnB167" href="rom_note.htm#fn167"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> the circumcision<a name="fnB168" href="rom_note.htm#fn168"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> or also for<a name="fnB169" href="rom_note.htm#fn169"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> the uncircumcision? For we say, "<i>faith <b>was credited to </b>Abraham <b>as righteousness</b></i>."<a name="fnB170" href="rom_note.htm#fn170"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 10>10  How then was it credited to him? Was he circumcised at the time, or not? No, he was not circumcised but uncircumcised!
<bqverse 11>11  And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised,<a name="fnB171" href="rom_note.htm#fn171"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> so that he would become<a name="fnB172" href="rom_note.htm#fn172"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> the father of all those who believe but have never been circumcised,<a name="fnB173" href="rom_note.htm#fn173"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> that they too could have righteousness credited to them.
<bqverse 12>12  And he is also the father of the circumcised,<a name="fnB174" href="rom_note.htm#fn174"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> who are not only circumcised, but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham possessed when he was still uncircumcised.<a name="fnB175" href="rom_note.htm#fn175"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 13>13  For the promise<a name="fnB176" href="rom_note.htm#fn176"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> to Abraham or to his descendants that he would inherit the world was not fulfilled through the law, but through the righteousness that comes by faith. 
<bqverse 14>14  For if they become heirs by the law, faith is empty and the promise is nullified.<a name="fnB177" href="rom_note.htm#fn177"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  For the law brings wrath, because where there is no law there is no transgression<a name="fnB178" href="rom_note.htm#fn178"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> either. 
<bqverse 16>16  For this reason it is by faith so that it may be by grace,<a name="fnB179" href="rom_note.htm#fn179"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> with the result that the promise may be certain to all the descendants--not only to those who are under the law, but also to those who have the faith of Abraham,<a name="fnB180" href="rom_note.htm#fn180"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> who is the father of us all 
<bqverse 17>17  (as it is written, "<b><i>I have made you the father of many nations</i></b>").<a name="fnB181" href="rom_note.htm#fn181"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> He is our father<a name="fnB182" href="rom_note.htm#fn182"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> in the presence of God whom he believed--the God who<a name="fnB183" href="rom_note.htm#fn183"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> makes the dead alive and summons the things that do not yet exist as though they already do.<a name="fnB184" href="rom_note.htm#fn184"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  Against hope Abraham<a name="fnB185" href="rom_note.htm#fn185"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> believed<a name="fnB186" href="rom_note.htm#fn186"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> in hope with the result that he became <b><i>the</i> <i>father of many nations</i></b><a name="fnB187" href="rom_note.htm#fn187"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> according to the pronouncement,<a name="fnB188" href="rom_note.htm#fn188"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> "<b><i>so will your descendants be</i></b>."<a name="fnB189" href="rom_note.htm#fn189"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  Without being weak in faith, he considered<a name="fnB190" href="rom_note.htm#fn190"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> his own body as dead<a name="fnB191" href="rom_note.htm#fn191"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> (because he was about one hundred years old) and the deadness of Sarah's womb. 
<bqverse 20>20  He<a name="fnB192" href="rom_note.htm#fn192"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> did not waver in unbelief about the promise of God but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God. 
<bqverse 21>21  He was<a name="fnB193" href="rom_note.htm#fn193"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> fully convinced that what God<a name="fnB194" href="rom_note.htm#fn194"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> promised he was also able to do. 
<bqverse 22>22  So indeed it was credited to Abraham<a name="fnB195" href="rom_note.htm#fn195"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> as righteousness.<p>

<bqverse 23>23  But the statement<b><i> it was credited to him</i></b><a name="fnB196" href="rom_note.htm#fn196"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> was not written only for Abraham's<a name="fnB197" href="rom_note.htm#fn197"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> sake, 
<bqverse 24>24  but also for our sake, to whom it will be credited, those who believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. 
<bqverse 25>25  He<a name="fnB198" href="rom_note.htm#fn198"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> was given over<a name="fnB199" href="rom_note.htm#fn199"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> because of our transgressions and was raised for the sake of<a name="fnB200" href="rom_note.htm#fn200"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> our justification.<a name="fnB201" href="rom_note.htm#fn201"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 3>3  Not<a name="fnB205" href="rom_note.htm#fn205"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> only this, but we also rejoice in sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,
<bqverse 4>4 and endurance, character, and character, hope.
<bqverse 5>5  And hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out<a name="fnB206" href="rom_note.htm#fn206"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.<p>

<bqverse 6>6  For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.

<bqverse 8>8  But God demonstrates his own love for us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

<p><i>The Amplification of Justification </i>

<bqverse 12>12  So then, just as sin entered the world through one man and death through sin, and so death spread to all people<a name="fnB213" href="rom_note.htm#fn213"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> because<a name="fnB214" href="rom_note.htm#fn214"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> all sinned--

<bqverse 14>14  Yet death reigned from Adam until Moses even over those who did not sin in the same way that Adam (who is a type<a name="fnB217" href="rom_note.htm#fn217"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> of the coming one) transgressed.<a name="fnB218" href="rom_note.htm#fn218"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 17>17  For if, by the transgression of the one man,<a name="fnB225" href="rom_note.htm#fn225"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> death reigned through the one, how much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ!<p>

<bqverse 18>18  Consequently,<a name="fnB226" href="rom_note.htm#fn226"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> just as condemnation<a name="fnB227" href="rom_note.htm#fn227"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> for all people<a name="fnB228" href="rom_note.htm#fn228"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> came<a name="fnB229" href="rom_note.htm#fn229"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> through one transgression,<a name="fnB230" href="rom_note.htm#fn230"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> so too through the one righteous act<a name="fnB231" href="rom_note.htm#fn231"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> came righteousness leading to life<a name="fnB232" href="rom_note.htm#fn232"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> for all people. 
<bqverse 19>19  For just as through the disobedience of the one man<a name="fnB233" href="rom_note.htm#fn233"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> many<a name="fnB234" href="rom_note.htm#fn234"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> were made sinners, so also through the obedience of one man<a name="fnB235" href="rom_note.htm#fn235"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> many<a name="fnB236" href="rom_note.htm#fn236"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> will be made righteous. 
<bqverse 20>20  Now the law came in<a name="fnB237" href="rom_note.htm#fn237"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> so that the transgression<a name="fnB238" href="rom_note.htm#fn238"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> may increase, but where sin increased, grace multiplied all the more, 
<bqverse 21>21  so that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace will reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

<p><i>The Believer's Freedom from Sin's Domination</i>
<p><A NAME="6"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> What shall we say then? Are we to remain in sin so that grace may increase? 
<bqverse 2>2  Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it?
<bqverse 3>3  Or do you not know that as many as were baptized into Christ were baptized into his death? 
<bqverse 4>4  Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too may walk in new life.<a name="fnB239" href="rom_note.htm#fn239"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 5>5  For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we will certainly also be united in the likeness of his resurrection.<a name="fnB240" href="rom_note.htm#fn240"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  We know that<a name="fnB241" href="rom_note.htm#fn241"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> our old man was crucified with him so that the body of sin would no longer dominate us,<a name="fnB242" href="rom_note.htm#fn242"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. 
<bqverse 7>7  (For someone who has died has been freed from sin.)<a name="fnB243" href="rom_note.htm#fn243"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 8>8  Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. 
<bqverse 9>9  We know<a name="fnB244" href="rom_note.htm#fn244"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> that since Christ has been raised from the dead, he is never going to die<a name="fnB245" href="rom_note.htm#fn245"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> again; death no longer has mastery over him. 
<bqverse 10>10  For the death he died, he died to sin once for all, but the life he lives, he lives to God. 
<bqverse 11>11  So you too consider yourselves<a name="fnB246" href="rom_note.htm#fn246"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> dead to sin, but<a name="fnB247" href="rom_note.htm#fn247"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> alive to God in Christ Jesus.<p>

<bqverse 12>12  Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its desires, 
<bqverse 13>13  and do not present your members to sin as instruments<a name="fnB248" href="rom_note.htm#fn248"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> to be used for unrighteousness,<a name="fnB249" href="rom_note.htm#fn249"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> but present yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead and your members to God as instruments<a name="fnB250" href="rom_note.htm#fn250"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> to be used for righteousness. 
<bqverse 14>14  For sin will have no mastery over you, because you are not under law but under grace.<a name="_Toc403221798"></a><a name="_Toc416894285"></a><a name="_Toc432265148"></a><a name="_Toc485060089"></a><a name="_Toc494013586"></a></p>
<p><i>The Believer's Enslavement to God's Righteousness</i>
<p>
<bqverse 15>15 What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Absolutely not!
<bqverse 16>16 Do you not know that if you present yourselves<a name="fnB251" href="rom_note.htm#fn251"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> as obedient slaves,<a name="fnB252" href="rom_note.htm#fn252"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> you are slaves of the one you obey, either of sin resulting in death, or obedience resulting in righteousness?<a name="fnB253" href="rom_note.htm#fn253"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17 But thanks be to God that though you were slaves to sin, you obeyed<a name="fnB254" href="rom_note.htm#fn254"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> from the heart that pattern<a name="fnB255" href="rom_note.htm#fn255"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> of teaching you were entrusted to,
<bqverse 18>18 and having been freed from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness.
<bqverse 19>19 (I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh.)<a name="fnB256" href="rom_note.htm#fn256"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.
<bqverse 20>20 For when you were slaves of sin, you were free with regard to righteousness.<p>

<bqverse 21>21 So what benefit<a name="fnB257" href="rom_note.htm#fn257"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> did you then reap<a name="fnB258" href="rom_note.htm#fn258"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> from those things that you are now ashamed of? For the end of those things is death.
<bqverse 22>22 But now, freed<a name="fnB259" href="rom_note.htm#fn259"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> from sin and enslaved to God, you have your benefit<a name="fnB260" href="rom_note.htm#fn260"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> leading to sanctification, and the end is eternal life.
<bqverse 23>23 For the payoff<a name="fnB261" href="rom_note.htm#fn261"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

<p><i>The Believer's Relationship to the Law</i>
<p><A NAME="7"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Or do you not know, brothers and sisters<a name="fnB262" href="rom_note.htm#fn262"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> (for I am speaking to those who know the law), that the law is lord over a person<a name="fnB263" href="rom_note.htm#fn263"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> as long as he lives?
<bqverse 2>2  For a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives, but if her<a name="fnB264" href="rom_note.htm#fn264"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> husband dies, she is released from the law of the marriage.<a name="fnB265" href="rom_note.htm#fn265"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 3>3 So then,<a name="fnB266" href="rom_note.htm#fn266"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> if she is joined to another man while her husband is alive, she will be called an adulteress. But if her<a name="fnB267" href="rom_note.htm#fn267"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she is joined to another man, she is not an adulteress.
<bqverse 4>4  So, my brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB268" href="rom_note.htm#fn268"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> you also died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you could be joined to another, to the one who was raised from the dead, to bear fruit to God.<a name="fnB269" href="rom_note.htm#fn269"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 5>5  For when we were in the flesh,<a name="fnB270" href="rom_note.htm#fn270"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> the sinful desires,<a name="fnB271" href="rom_note.htm#fn271"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> aroused by the law, were active in the members of our body<a name="fnB272" href="rom_note.htm#fn272"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> to bear fruit for death.
<bqverse 6>6  But now we have been released from the law, because we have died<a name="fnB273" href="rom_note.htm#fn273"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> to what controlled us, so that we may serve in the new life of the Spirit and not under the old written code.<a name="fnB274" href="rom_note.htm#fn274"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a><b> </b><p>

<bqverse 7>7  What shall we say then? Is the law sin? Absolutely not! Certainly, I<a name="fnB275" href="rom_note.htm#fn275"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> would not have known sin except through the law. For indeed I would not have known what it means to desire something belonging to someone else<a name="fnB276" href="rom_note.htm#fn276"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> if the law had not said, "<b><i>Do not covet</i></b>."<a name="fnB277" href="rom_note.htm#fn277"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  But sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of wrong desires.<a name="fnB278" href="rom_note.htm#fn278"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> For apart from the law, sin is dead. 
<bqverse 9>9  And I was once alive apart from the law, but with the coming of the commandment sin became alive 
<bqverse 10>10  and I died. So<a name="fnB279" href="rom_note.htm#fn279"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life brought death!<a name="fnB280" href="rom_note.htm#fn280"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  For sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it I died.<a name="fnB281" href="rom_note.htm#fn281"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous, and good.<p>

<bqverse 13>13  Did that which is good, then, become death to me? Absolutely not! But sin, so that it would be shown to be sin, produced death in me through what is good, so that through the commandment sin would become utterly sinful. 
<bqverse 14>14  For we know that the law is spiritual--but I am unspiritual, sold into slavery to sin.<a name="fnB282" href="rom_note.htm#fn282"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  For I don't understand what I am doing. For I do not do what I want--instead, I do what I hate.<a name="fnB283" href="rom_note.htm#fn283"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  But if I do what I don't want, I agree that the law is good.<a name="fnB284" href="rom_note.htm#fn284"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  But now it is no longer me doing it, but sin that lives in me. 
<bqverse 18>18  For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh. For I want to do the good, but I cannot do it.<a name="fnB285" href="rom_note.htm#fn285"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  For I do not do the good I want, but I do the very evil I do not want! 
<bqverse 20>20  Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer me doing it but sin that lives in me.<p>
 
<bqverse 21>21  So, I find the law that when I want to do good, evil is present with me. 
<bqverse 22>22  For I delight in the law of God in my inner being. 
<bqverse 23>23  But I see a different law in my members waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that is in my members. 
<bqverse 24>24  Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? 
<bqverse 25>25  Thanks be<a name="fnB286" href="rom_note.htm#fn286"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then,<a name="fnB287" href="rom_note.htm#fn287"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but<a name="fnB288" href="rom_note.htm#fn288"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> with my flesh I serve<a name="fnB289" href="rom_note.htm#fn289"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> the law of sin.

<p><i>Believer's Relationship to the Holy Spirit</i>
<p><A NAME="8"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.<a name="fnB290" href="rom_note.htm#fn290"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  For the law of the life-giving Spirit<a name="fnB291" href="rom_note.htm#fn291"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> in Christ Jesus has set you<a name="fnB292" href="rom_note.htm#fn292"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> free from the law of sin and death. 
<bqverse 3>3  For God achieved what the law could not do because<a name="fnB293" href="rom_note.htm#fn293"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> it was weakened through the flesh. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, 
<bqverse 4>4  so that the righteous requirement of the law may be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.<p>
 
<bqverse 5>5  For those who live according to the flesh have their outlook shaped by<a name="fnB294" href="rom_note.htm#fn294"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit have their outlook shaped by the things of the Spirit. 
<bqverse 6>6  For the outlook<a name="fnB295" href="rom_note.htm#fn295"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> of the flesh is death, but the outlook of the Spirit is life and peace, 
<bqverse 7>7  because the outlook of the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to the law of God, nor is it able to do so. 
<bqverse 8>8  Those who are in the flesh cannot please God. 
<bqverse 9>9  You, however, are not in<a name="fnB296" href="rom_note.htm#fn296"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, this person does not belong to him. 
<bqverse 10>10  But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, but<a name="fnB297" href="rom_note.htm#fn297"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> the Spirit is your life<a name="fnB298" href="rom_note.htm#fn298"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> because of righteousness. 
<bqverse 11>11  Moreover if the Spirit of the one<a name="fnB299" href="rom_note.htm#fn299"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, the one who raised Christ<a name="fnB300" href="rom_note.htm#fn300"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> from the dead will also make your mortal bodies alive through his Spirit who lives in you.<a name="fnB301" href="rom_note.htm#fn301"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 12>12  So then,<a name="fnB302" href="rom_note.htm#fn302"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB303" href="rom_note.htm#fn303"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> we are under obligation, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh 
<bqverse 13>13  (for if you live according to the flesh, you will<a name="fnB304" href="rom_note.htm#fn304"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> die),<a name="fnB305" href="rom_note.htm#fn305"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live. 
<bqverse 14>14  For all who are led by the Spirit of God are<a name="fnB306" href="rom_note.htm#fn306"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> the sons of God. 
<bqverse 15>15  For you did not receive the spirit of slavery leading again to fear,<a name="fnB307" href="rom_note.htm#fn307"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom<a name="fnB308" href="rom_note.htm#fn308"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> we cry, "Abba, Father." 
<bqverse 16>16  The Spirit himself bears witness to<a name="fnB309" href="rom_note.htm#fn309"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> our spirit that we are God's children. 
<bqverse 17>17  And if children, then heirs (namely, heirs of God and also fellow heirs with Christ)<a name="fnB310" href="rom_note.htm#fn310"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a>--if indeed we suffer with him so we may also be glorified with him. <p>

<bqverse 18>18  For I consider that our present sufferings cannot even be compared<a name="fnB311" href="rom_note.htm#fn311"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> to the glory that will be revealed to us. 
<bqverse 19>19  For the creation eagerly waits for the revelation of the sons of God. 
<bqverse 20>20  For the creation was subjected to futility--not willingly but because of God<a name="fnB312" href="rom_note.htm#fn312"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> who subjected it--in hope 
<bqverse 21>21  that the creation itself will also be set free from the bondage of decay into the glorious freedom of God's children. 
<bqverse 22>22  For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers together until now. 
<bqverse 23>23  Not only this, but we ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we eagerly await our adoption, the redemption of our bodies.<a name="fnB313" href="rom_note.htm#fn313"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  For in hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees? 
<bqverse 25>25  But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with endurance.<a name="fnB314" href="rom_note.htm#fn314"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 26>26  In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness, for we do not know how we should pray,<a name="fnB315" href="rom_note.htm#fn315"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings. 
<bqverse 27>27  And he<a name="fnB316" href="rom_note.htm#fn316"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit<a name="fnB317" href="rom_note.htm#fn317"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> intercedes on behalf of the saints according to God's will. 
<bqverse 28>28  And we know that all things work together<a name="fnB318" href="rom_note.htm#fn318"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose, 
<bqverse 29>29  because those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that his Son<a name="fnB319" href="rom_note.htm#fn319"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.<a name="fnB320" href="rom_note.htm#fn320"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 30>30  And those he predestined, he also called; and those he called, he also justified; and those he justified, he also glorified.<p>

<bqverse 31>31  What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? 
<bqverse 32>32  Indeed, he who<a name="fnB321" href="rom_note.htm#fn321"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, freely give us all things? 
<bqverse 33>33  Who will bring any charge against God's elect?<a name="fnB322" href="rom_note.htm#fn322"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> It is God who justifies. 
<bqverse 34>34  Who is the one who will condemn? Christ<a name="fnB323" href="rom_note.htm#fn323"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> is the one who died (and more than that, he was raised), who is at the right hand of God, and who also is interceding for us. 
<bqverse 35>35  Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will trouble, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?<a name="fnB324" href="rom_note.htm#fn324"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 36>36  As it is written, "<b><i>For your sake we encounter death all day long; we were considered as sheep to be slaughtered</i></b>."<a name="fnB325" href="rom_note.htm#fn325"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 37>37  No, in all these things we have complete victory<a name="fnB326" href="rom_note.htm#fn326"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> through him<a name="fnB327" href="rom_note.htm#fn327"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> who loved us! 
<bqverse 38>38  For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things that are present, nor things to come, nor powers, 
<bqverse 39>39  nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in creation will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

<p><i>Israel's Rejection Considered</i>
<p><A NAME="9"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b><a name="fnB328" href="rom_note.htm#fn328"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> I am telling the truth in Christ (I am not lying!), for my conscience assures me<a name="fnB329" href="rom_note.htm#fn329"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> in the Holy Spirit--
<bqverse 2>2  I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.<a name="fnB330" href="rom_note.htm#fn330"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 3>3  For I could wish<a name="fnB331" href="rom_note.htm#fn331"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> that I myself were accursed--cut off from Christ--for the sake of my people,<a name="fnB332" href="rom_note.htm#fn332"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> my fellow countrymen,<a name="fnB333" href="rom_note.htm#fn333"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 4>4  who are Israelites. To them belong<a name="fnB334" href="rom_note.htm#fn334"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> the adoption as sons, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the temple worship,<a name="fnB335" href="rom_note.htm#fn335"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> and the promises.
<bqverse 5>5  To them belong the patriarchs,<a name="fnB336" href="rom_note.htm#fn336"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> and from them,<a name="fnB337" href="rom_note.htm#fn337"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> by human descent,<a name="fnB338" href="rom_note.htm#fn338"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> came the Christ,<a name="fnB339" href="rom_note.htm#fn339"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> who is God over all, blessed forever!<a name="fnB340" href="rom_note.htm#fn340"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> Amen.<p>

<bqverse 6>6  It is not as though the word of God had failed. For not all those who are descended from Israel are truly Israel,<a name="fnB341" href="rom_note.htm#fn341"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  nor are all the children Abraham's true descendants; rather<b> </b>"<b><i>through Isaac will your descendants be traced</i></b>."<a name="fnB342" href="rom_note.htm#fn342"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  This means<a name="fnB343" href="rom_note.htm#fn343"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> it is not the children of the flesh<a name="fnB344" href="rom_note.htm#fn344"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> who are the children of God; rather, the children of promise are counted as descendants. 
<bqverse 9>9  For this is what the promise declared:<a name="fnB345" href="rom_note.htm#fn345"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> "<b><i>About a year from now</i></b><a name="fnB346" href="rom_note.htm#fn346"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> I will return and Sarah will have a son</i></b>."<a name="fnB347" href="rom_note.htm#fn347"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  Not only that, but when Rebekah had conceived children by one man,<a name="fnB348" href="rom_note.htm#fn348"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> our ancestor Isaac-- 
<bqverse 11>11  even before they were born or had done anything good or bad (so that God's purpose in election<a name="fnB349" href="rom_note.htm#fn349"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> would stand, not by works but by<a name="fnB350" href="rom_note.htm#fn350"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> his calling)<a name="fnB351" href="rom_note.htm#fn351"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a>-- 
<bqverse 12>12  it was said to her, "<b><i>The older will serve the younger</i></b>,"<a name="fnB352" href="rom_note.htm#fn352"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  just as it is written: "<b><i>Jacob I loved</i></b><i>,<b> but Esau I hated</b></i>."<a name="fnB353" href="rom_note.htm#fn353"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 14>14  What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? Absolutely not! 
<bqverse 15>15  For he says to Moses: "<b><i>I will have mercy on whom I have mercy</i></b><i>,<b> and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion</b></i>."<a name="fnB354" href="rom_note.htm#fn354"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  So then,<a name="fnB355" href="rom_note.htm#fn355"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> it does not depend on human desire or exertion, but on the mercy of God.<a name="fnB356" href="rom_note.htm#fn356"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  For the scripture says to Pharaoh:<a name="fnB357" href="rom_note.htm#fn357"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> "<b><i>For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I may demonstrate my power in you</i></b><i>,<b> and that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth</b></i>."<a name="fnB358" href="rom_note.htm#fn358"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  So then,<a name="fnB359" href="rom_note.htm#fn359"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> God<a name="fnB360" href="rom_note.htm#fn360"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> has mercy on whom he chooses to have mercy, and he hardens whom he chooses to harden.<a name="fnB361" href="rom_note.htm#fn361"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 19>19  You will say to me then, "Why does he still find fault? For who has ever resisted his will?" 
<bqverse 20>20  But who indeed are you--a mere human being<a name="fnB362" href="rom_note.htm#fn362"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a>--to talk back to God?<a name="fnB363" href="rom_note.htm#fn363"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a><b> <i>Does what is molded say to the molder</i></b><i>,<b> </b></i>"<b><i>Why have you made me like this?</i></b>"<a name="fnB364" href="rom_note.htm#fn364"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a><i> </i>
<bqverse 21>21  Has the potter no right to make from the same lump of clay<a name="fnB365" href="rom_note.htm#fn365"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> one vessel for special use and another for ordinary use?<a name="fnB366" href="rom_note.htm#fn366"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  But what if God, willing to demonstrate his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience the objects<a name="fnB367" href="rom_note.htm#fn367"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> of wrath<a name="fnB368" href="rom_note.htm#fn368"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> prepared for destruction?<a name="fnB369" href="rom_note.htm#fn369"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23  And what if he is willing to make known the wealth of his glory on the objects<a name="fnB370" href="rom_note.htm#fn370"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> of mercy that he has prepared beforehand for glory-- 
<bqverse 24>24  even us, whom he has called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles? 
<bqverse 25>25  As he also says in Hosea:</p>
<br><b><i>"<b><i>I will call those who were not my people</i></b><i>,<b> </b></i>`<b><i>My people</i></b><i>,</i>'<b><i> and I will call her who was unloved,</i></b><a name="fnB371" href="rom_note.htm#fn371"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> </i></b>`<b><i>My beloved</i></b><i>.</i>'"<a name="fnB372" href="rom_note.htm#fn372"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a><br>
<bqverse 26>26 "<b><i>And in the very place</i></b><a name="fnB373" href="rom_note.htm#fn373"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> <b><i>where it was said to them</i></b><i>,<b> </b></i>`<b><i>You are not my people</i></b><i>,</i>'<b><i> </i></b><br>

<bqverse 27>27  And Isaiah cries out on behalf of Israel, "Though the number of the children<a name="fnB375" href="rom_note.htm#fn375"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> of Israel are as the sand of the sea, only the remnant will be saved,

<bqverse 29>29  Just<a name="fnB377" href="rom_note.htm#fn377"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> as Isaiah predicted, </p>
<br><b><i>"<b><i>If the Lord of armies</i></b><a name="fnB378" href="rom_note.htm#fn378"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> had not left us descendants</i></b><i>,<b> </b></i><br>

<p>
<bqverse 30>30  What shall we say then?--that the Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness obtained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith, 
<bqverse 31>31  but Israel even though pursuing<a name="fnB380" href="rom_note.htm#fn380"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> a law of righteousness<a name="fnB381" href="rom_note.htm#fn381"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> did not attain it.<a name="fnB382" href="rom_note.htm#fn382"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 32>32  Why not? Because they pursued<a name="fnB383" href="rom_note.htm#fn383"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> it not by faith but (as if it were possible) by works.<a name="fnB384" href="rom_note.htm#fn384"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> They stumbled over the stumbling stone,<a name="fnB385" href="rom_note.htm#fn385"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 33>33  just as it is written, </p>
<br><b><i>"<b><i>Look</i></b><i>,<b> I am laying in Zion a stone that will cause people to stumble</b></i><br>
<b><i>and a rock that will make them fall,</i></b><a name="fnB386" href="rom_note.htm#fn386"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> </i></b><br>
<b><i>yet the one who believes in him will not be put to shame."</i></b><a name="fnB387" href="rom_note.htm#fn387"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a></i></b></ul><p>
<bqchapter 10><A NAME="10"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB388" href="rom_note.htm#fn388"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> my heart's desire and prayer to God on behalf of my fellow countrymen<a name="fnB389" href="rom_note.htm#fn389"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> is for their salvation. 
<bqverse 2>2  For I can testify that they are zealous for God,<a name="fnB390" href="rom_note.htm#fn390"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> but their zeal is not in line with the truth.<a name="fnB391" href="rom_note.htm#fn391"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  For ignoring the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking instead to establish their own righteousness, they did not submit to God's righteousness. 
<bqverse 4>4  For Christ is the end of the law, with the result that there is righteousness for everyone who believes.<p>

<bqverse 5>5  For Moses writes about the righteousness that is by the law:<b> </b>"<b><i>The one who does these things will live by them</i></b>."<a name="fnB392" href="rom_note.htm#fn392"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  But the righteousness that is by faith says: "<b><i>Do not say in your heart</i></b>,<a name="fnB393" href="rom_note.htm#fn393"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a><i> </i>`<i>Who will ascend into heaven?</i>'"<a name="fnB394" href="rom_note.htm#fn394"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> (that is, to bring Christ down) 
<bqverse 7>7  or "<b><i>Who will descend into the abyss?</i></b>"<a name="fnB395" href="rom_note.htm#fn395"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). 
<bqverse 8>8  But what does it say? "<b><i>The word is near you</i></b><i>,<b> in your mouth and in your heart</b></i>"<a name="fnB396" href="rom_note.htm#fn396"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> (that is, the word of faith that we preach), 
<bqverse 9>9  because if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord<a name="fnB397" href="rom_note.htm#fn397"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 
<bqverse 10>10  For with the heart one believes and thus has righteousness<a name="fnB398" href="rom_note.htm#fn398"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> and with the mouth one confesses and thus has salvation.<a name="fnB399" href="rom_note.htm#fn399"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  For the scripture says, "<b><i>Everyone</i> <i>who believes in him will not be put to shame</i></b>."<a name="fnB400" href="rom_note.htm#fn400"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  For there is no distinction between the Jew and the Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all, who richly blesses all who call on him. 
<bqverse 13>13  For <b><i>everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved</i></b>.<a name="fnB401" href="rom_note.htm#fn401"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 14>14  How are they to call on one they have not believed in? And how are they to believe in one they have not heard of? And how are they to hear without someone preaching to them<a name="fnB402" href="rom_note.htm#fn402"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a>? 
<bqverse 15>15  And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "<b><i>How timely</i></b><a name="fnB403" href="rom_note.htm#fn403"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a><b><i>is the arrival</i></b><a name="fnB404" href="rom_note.htm#fn404"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> of those who proclaim the good news</i></b>."<a name="fnB405" href="rom_note.htm#fn405"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  But not all have obeyed the good news, for Isaiah says, "<b><i>Lord</i></b><i>,<b> who has believed our report</b></i>?"<a name="fnB406" href="rom_note.htm#fn406"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  Consequently faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the preached word<a name="fnB407" href="rom_note.htm#fn407"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> of Christ.<a name="fnB408" href="rom_note.htm#fn408"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 18>18  But I ask, have they<a name="fnB409" href="rom_note.htm#fn409"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> not heard?<a name="fnB410" href="rom_note.htm#fn410"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> Yes, they have:<a name="fnB411" href="rom_note.htm#fn411"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> <b><i>Their voice has gone out to all the earth</i></b><i>,<b> and their words to the ends of the world</b></i>.<a name="fnB412" href="rom_note.htm#fn412"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  But again I ask, didn't Israel understand?<a name="fnB413" href="rom_note.htm#fn413"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> First Moses says, "<b><i>I will make you jealous by those who are not a nation; with a senseless nation I will provoke you to anger</i></b>."<a name="fnB414" href="rom_note.htm#fn414"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  And Isaiah is even bold enough to say, "<b><i>I was found by those who did not seek me; I became well known to those who did not ask for me</i></b>."<a name="fnB415" href="rom_note.htm#fn415"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  But about Israel he says, "<b><i>All day long I held out my hands to this disobedient and stubborn people!</i></b>"<a name="fnB416" href="rom_note.htm#fn416"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a>

"<b><i>I have kept</i></b> for myself <b><i>seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal</i></b>."<a name="fnB419" href="rom_note.htm#fn419"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 5>5  So in the same way at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. 
<bqverse 6>6  And if it is by grace, it is no longer by works, otherwise grace would no longer be grace. 
<bqverse 7>7  What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was diligently seeking, but the elect obtained it. The<a name="fnB420" href="rom_note.htm#fn420"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> rest were hardened, 
<bqverse 8>8  as it is written,</p>
<br><b><i><b><i>"God gave them a spirit of stupor</i></b><i>,</i><br>
<b><i>eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear</i></b><i>,<b> </b></i><br>
<b><i>to this very day."</i></b><a name="fnB421" href="rom_note.htm#fn421"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> </i></b></i></b></ul><p>
<bqverse 9>9 And David says,</p>
<br><b><i><b><i>"Let their table become a snare and trap</i></b><i>,</i><br>
<b><i>a stumbling block and a retribution for them</i></b><i>;</i><br>

<bqverse 10>10  <b><i>let their eyes be darkened so that they may not see,</i></b><br>
<b><i>and make their backs bend continually."</i></b><a name="fnB422" href="rom_note.htm#fn422"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a><b><i> </i></b></i></b></ul><p>
<bqverse 11>11 I ask then, they did not stumble into an irrevocable fall,<a name="fnB423" href="rom_note.htm#fn423"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> did they? Absolutely not! But by their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make Israel<a name="fnB424" href="rom_note.htm#fn424"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> jealous. 
<bqverse 12>12 Now if their transgression means riches for the world and their defeat means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full restoration<a name="fnB425" href="rom_note.htm#fn425"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> bring?<p>

<bqverse 13>13  Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Seeing that I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry, 
<bqverse 14>14  if somehow I could provoke my people to jealousy and save some of them. 
<bqverse 15>15  For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? 
<bqverse 16>16  If the first portion<a name="fnB426" href="rom_note.htm#fn426"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> of the dough offered is holy, then the whole batch is holy, and if the root is holy, so too are the branches.<a name="fnB427" href="rom_note.htm#fn427"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 17>17  Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among them and participated in<a name="fnB428" href="rom_note.htm#fn428"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> the richness of the olive root, 
<bqverse 18>18  do not boast over the branches. But if you boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you. 
<bqverse 19>19  Then you will say, "The branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in." 
<bqverse 20>20  Granted!<a name="fnB429" href="rom_note.htm#fn429"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but fear! 
<bqverse 21>21  For if God did not spare the natural branches, perhaps he will not spare you. 
<bqverse 22>22  Notice therefore the kindness and harshness of God--harshness toward those who have fallen, but<a name="fnB430" href="rom_note.htm#fn430"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> God's kindness toward you, provided you continue in his kindness;<a name="fnB431" href="rom_note.htm#fn431"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> otherwise you also will be cut off. 
<bqverse 23>23  And even they--if they do not continue in their unbelief--will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. 
<bqverse 24>24  For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree?<p>

<bqverse 25>25  For I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB432" href="rom_note.htm#fn432"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> so that you may not be conceited: a partial hardening has happened to Israel<a name="fnB433" href="rom_note.htm#fn433"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> until the full number<a name="fnB434" href="rom_note.htm#fn434"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> of the Gentiles has come in. 
<bqverse 26>26  And so<a name="fnB435" href="rom_note.htm#fn435"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> all Israel will be saved, as it is written:</p>
<br><b><i><b><i>"The Deliverer will come out of Zion;</i></b><br>
<b><i>he will remove ungodliness from Jacob</i></b><i>.<b> </b></i><br>
<b><i>
<bqverse 27>27 </i></b> <b><i>And this is my covenant with them</i></b><i>,</i><a name="fnB436" href="rom_note.htm#fn436"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a><br>
<b><i>when I take away their sins."</i></b><a name="fnB437" href="rom_note.htm#fn437"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a></i></b></ul><p>
<bqverse 28>28 In regard to the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but in regard to election they are dearly loved for the sake of the fathers. 
<bqverse 29>29 For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable. 
<bqverse 30>30 Just as you were formerly disobedient to God, but have now received mercy due to their disobedience, 
<bqverse 31>31 so they too have now been disobedient in order that, by the mercy shown to you, they too may<a name="fnB438" href="rom_note.htm#fn438"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> receive mercy. 
<bqverse 32>32 For God has consigned all to disobedience so that he may show mercy to all. <p>

<bqverse 33>33 Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how fathomless his ways!</p>
<br><b><i><b><i>
<bqverse 34>34 </i></b> <b><i>For who has known the mind of the Lord</i></b><i>,</i><br>

<p><i>Consecration of the Believer's Life</i>
<p><A NAME="12"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Therefore I exhort you, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB443" href="rom_note.htm#fn443"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a sacrifice--alive, holy, and pleasing to God<a name="fnB444" href="rom_note.htm#fn444"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a>--which is your reasonable service.

<p><i>Conduct in Humility</i>
<p>
<bqverse 3>3  For by the grace given to me I say to every one of you not to think more highly of yourself than you ought to think, but to think with sober discernment, as God has distributed to each of you<a name="fnB448" href="rom_note.htm#fn448"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> a measure of faith.<a name="fnB449" href="rom_note.htm#fn449"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  For just as in one body we have many members, and not all the members serve the same function, 
<bqverse 5>5  so we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually we are members who belong to one another. 
<bqverse 6>6  And we have different gifts,<a name="fnB450" href="rom_note.htm#fn450"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> according to the grace given to us. If the gift is prophecy, that individual must use it in proportion to his faith. 
<bqverse 7>7  If it is service, he must serve; if it is teaching, he must teach; 
<bqverse 8>8  if it is exhortation, he must exhort; if it is contributing, he must do so with sincerity; if it is leadership, he must do so with diligence; if it is showing mercy, he must do so with cheerfulness. <a name="_Toc403221806"></a><a name="_Toc416894293"></a><a name="_Toc432265156"></a><a name="_Toc485060097"></a><a name="_Toc494013594"></a></p>

<bqverse 9>9  Love must be<a name="fnB451" href="rom_note.htm#fn451"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil, cling to what is good. 
<bqverse 10>10  Be devoted to one another with mutual love, showing eagerness in honoring one another. 
<bqverse 11>11  Do not lag in zeal, be enthusiastic in spirit, serve the Lord. 
<bqverse 12>12  Rejoice in hope, endure in suffering, persist in prayer. 
<bqverse 13>13  Contribute to the needs of the saints, pursue hospitality. 
<bqverse 14>14  Bless those who persecute you, bless and do not curse. 
<bqverse 15>15  Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. 
<bqverse 16>16  Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty but associate with the lowly.<a name="fnB452" href="rom_note.htm#fn452"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> Do not be conceited.<a name="fnB453" href="rom_note.htm#fn453"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 18>18  If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all people.<a name="fnB455" href="rom_note.htm#fn455"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Submission to Civil Government</i>
<p><A NAME="13"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except by God's appointment,<a name="fnB459" href="rom_note.htm#fn459"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> and the authorities that exist have been instituted by God. 
<bqverse 2>2  So the person who resists such authority<a name="fnB460" href="rom_note.htm#fn460"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will incur judgment 
<bqverse 3>3  (for rulers cause no fear for good conduct but for bad). Do you desire not to fear authority? Do good and you will receive its commendation, 
<bqverse 4>4  for it is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be in fear, for it does not bear the sword in vain. It is God's servant to administer retribution on the wrongdoer. 
<bqverse 5>5  Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of the wrath of the authorities<a name="fnB461" href="rom_note.htm#fn461"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> but also because of your conscience.<a name="fnB462" href="rom_note.htm#fn462"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  For this reason you also pay taxes, for the authorities<a name="fnB463" href="rom_note.htm#fn463"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> are God's servants devoted to governing.<a name="fnB464" href="rom_note.htm#fn464"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  Pay everyone what is owed: taxes to whom taxes are due, revenue to whom revenue is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due. <a name="_Toc403221808"></a><a name="_Toc416894295"></a><a name="_Toc432265158"></a><a name="_Toc485060099"></a><a name="_Toc494013596"></a></p>
<p><i>Exhortation to Love Neighbors</i>
<p>
<bqverse 8>8  Owe no one anything, except to love one another, for the one who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.<p>

<bqverse 9>9  For the commandments,<a name="fnB465" href="rom_note.htm#fn465"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> "<b><i>do not commit adultery</i></b><i>,<b> do not murder</b>,<b> do not steal</b>,<b> do not covet</b>,</i>"<a name="fnB466" href="rom_note.htm#fn466"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> (and if there is any other commandment) are summed up in this, "<b><i>Love your neighbor as yourself</i></b>."<a name="fnB467" href="rom_note.htm#fn467"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  Love does no wrong to a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law. <a name="_Toc403221809"></a><a name="_Toc416894296"></a><a name="_Toc432265159"></a><a name="_Toc485060100"></a><a name="_Toc494013597"></a></p>

<bqverse 11>11  And do this<a name="fnB468" href="rom_note.htm#fn468"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> because we know<a name="fnB469" href="rom_note.htm#fn469"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> the time, that it is already the hour for us to awake from sleep, for our salvation is now nearer than when we became believers. 
<bqverse 12>12  The night has advanced toward dawn; the day is near. So then we must lay aside the works of darkness, and put on the weapons of light. 
<bqverse 13>13  Let us live decently as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in discord and jealousy. <p>

<bqverse 14>14  Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to arouse its desires.<a name="fnB470" href="rom_note.htm#fn470"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Exhortation to Mutual Forbearance</i>
<p><A NAME="14"><b>

<bqverse 2>2  One person believes in eating everything, but the weak person eats only vegetables. 
<bqverse 3>3  The one who eats everything must not despise the one who does not, and the one who abstains must not judge the one who eats everything, for God has accepted him. 
<bqverse 4>4  Who are you to pass judgment on another's servant? Before his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord<a name="fnB472" href="rom_note.htm#fn472"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> is able to make him stand. <p>

<bqverse 5>5  One person regards one day holier than other days, and another regards them all alike.<a name="fnB473" href="rom_note.htm#fn473"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> Each must be fully convinced in his own mind. 
<bqverse 6>6  The one who observes the day, does it for the Lord. The<a name="fnB474" href="rom_note.htm#fn474"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> one who eats, eats for the Lord, because he gives thanks to God, and the one who abstains from eating, abstains for the Lord, and he gives thanks to God. 
<bqverse 7>7  For none of us lives for himself and none dies for himself. 
<bqverse 8>8  If we live, we live for the Lord; if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lord's. 
<bqverse 9>9  For this reason Christ died and returned to life, so that he may be the Lord of both the dead and the living. <p>

<bqverse 10>10  But why do you judge your brother or sister?<a name="fnB475" href="rom_note.htm#fn475"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> Or again, why do you despise your brother or sister?<a name="fnB476" href="rom_note.htm#fn476"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> For we will all stand before the judgment seat<a name="fnB477" href="rom_note.htm#fn477"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> of God. 
<bqverse 11>11  For it is written,<b> </b>"<b><i>As I live</i></b><i>,<b> says the Lord</b>,<b> every knee will bow to me</b>,<b> and every tongue will give praise to God</b></i>."<a name="fnB478" href="rom_note.htm#fn478"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Exhortation for the Strong not to Destroy the Weak</i>
<p>
<bqverse 13>13  Therefore we must not pass judgment on one another, but rather determine never to place an obstacle or a trap before a brother or sister.<a name="fnB481" href="rom_note.htm#fn481"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean in itself; still, it is unclean to the one who considers it unclean. 
<bqverse 15>15  For if your brother or sister<a name="fnB482" href="rom_note.htm#fn482"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> is distressed because of what you eat,<a name="fnB483" href="rom_note.htm#fn483"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> you are no longer walking in love.<a name="fnB484" href="rom_note.htm#fn484"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> Do not destroy by your food someone for whom Christ died. 
<bqverse 16>16  Therefore do not let what you consider good<a name="fnB485" href="rom_note.htm#fn485"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> be spoken of as evil. 
<bqverse 17>17  For the kingdom of God does not consist of food and drink, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. 
<bqverse 18>18  For the one who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by people.<a name="fnB486" href="rom_note.htm#fn486"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 19>19  So then, let us pursue what makes for peace and for building up one another. 
<bqverse 20>20  Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. For although all things are clean,<a name="fnB487" href="rom_note.htm#fn487"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> it is wrong to cause anyone to stumble by what you eat. 
<bqverse 21>21  It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything that causes your brother to stumble.<a name="fnB488" href="rom_note.htm#fn488"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  The faith<a name="fnB489" href="rom_note.htm#fn489"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> you have, keep to yourself before God. Blessed is the one who does not judge himself by what he approves. 
<bqverse 23>23  But the man who doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not do so from faith, and whatever is not from faith is sin.<a name="fnB490" href="rom_note.htm#fn490"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 3>3  For even Christ did not please himself, but just as it is written, "<b><i>The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me</i></b>."<a name="fnB492" href="rom_note.htm#fn492"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  For everything that was written in former times was written for our instruction, so that through endurance and through encouragement of the scriptures we may have hope. 
<bqverse 5>5  Now may the God of endurance and comfort give you unity with one another<a name="fnB493" href="rom_note.htm#fn493"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> in accordance with Christ Jesus, 
<bqverse 6>6  so that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. <a name="_Toc403221813"></a><a name="_Toc416894300"></a><a name="_Toc432265163"></a><a name="_Toc485060104"></a><a name="_Toc494013601"></a></p>
<p><i>Exhortation to Mutual Acceptance</i>
<p>
<bqverse 7>7  Receive one another, then, just as Christ also received you, to God's glory. 
<bqverse 8>8  For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised<a name="fnB494" href="rom_note.htm#fn494"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> on behalf of God's truth to confirm the promises made to the fathers,<a name="fnB495" href="rom_note.htm#fn495"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  and thus the Gentiles glorify God for his mercy.<a name="fnB496" href="rom_note.htm#fn496"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> As it is written, "<b><i>Because of this I will confess you among the Gentiles</i></b><i>,<b> and I will sing praises to your name</b></i>."<a name="fnB497" href="rom_note.htm#fn497"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  And again it says: "<b><i>Rejoice</i></b><i>,<b> O Gentiles</b>,<b> with his people</b></i>."<a name="fnB498" href="rom_note.htm#fn498"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  And again, "<b><i>Praise the Lord all you Gentiles</i></b><i>,<b> and let all the peoples praise him</b></i>."<a name="fnB499" href="rom_note.htm#fn499"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  And again Isaiah says, "<b><i>The root of Jesse will come</i></b><i>,<b> and the one who rises to rule over the Gentiles</b>,<b> in him will the Gentiles hope</b></i>."<a name="fnB500" href="rom_note.htm#fn500"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you believe in him,<a name="fnB501" href="rom_note.htm#fn501"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. <a name="_Toc403221814"></a><a name="_Toc416894301"></a><a name="_Toc432265164"></a><a name="_Toc485060105"></a><a name="_Toc494013602"></a></p>
<p><i>Paul's Motivation for Writing the Letter</i>
<p>
<bqverse 14>14  But I myself am fully convinced about you, my brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB502" href="rom_note.htm#fn502"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able to instruct one another. 
<bqverse 15>15  But I have written more boldly to you on some points so as to remind you, because of the grace given to me by God 
<bqverse 16>16  to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. I serve<a name="fnB503" href="rom_note.htm#fn503"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> the gospel of God like a priest, so that the offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit. <p>

<bqverse 17>17  So I boast<a name="fnB504" href="rom_note.htm#fn504"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> in Christ Jesus about the things that pertain to God. 
<bqverse 18>18  For I will not dare to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in order to bring about the obedience<a name="fnB505" href="rom_note.htm#fn505"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> of the Gentiles, by word and deed, 
<bqverse 19>19  in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem even as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ. 
<bqverse 20>20  And in this way I desire to preach where Christ has not been named, so as not to build on another person's foundation, 
<bqverse 21>21  but as it is written: "<b><i>Those who were not told about him will see</i></b><i>,<b> and those who have not heard will understand</b></i>."<a name="fnB506" href="rom_note.htm#fn506"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> <a name="_Toc403221815"></a><a name="_Toc416894302"></a><a name="_Toc432265165"></a><a name="_Toc485060106"></a><a name="_Toc494013603"></a></p>
<p><i>Paul's Intention of Visiting the Romans</i>
<p>
<bqverse 22>22  This is the reason I was often hindered from coming to you. 
<bqverse 23>23  But now there is nothing more to keep me<a name="fnB507" href="rom_note.htm#fn507"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> in these regions, and I have for many years desired<a name="fnB508" href="rom_note.htm#fn508"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> to come to you 
<bqverse 24>24  when I go to Spain. For I hope to visit you when I pass through and that you will help me<a name="fnB509" href="rom_note.htm#fn509"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while. <p>

<bqverse 25>25  But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints. 
<bqverse 26>26  For Macedonia and Achaia are pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem. 
<bqverse 27>27  For they were pleased to do this, and indeed they are indebted to the Jerusalem saints.<a name="fnB510" href="rom_note.htm#fn510"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they are obligated also to minister to them in material things. 
<bqverse 28>28  Therefore after I have completed this and have safely delivered this bounty to them,<a name="fnB511" href="rom_note.htm#fn511"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> I will set out for Spain by way of you, 
<bqverse 29>29  and I know that when I come to you I will come in the fullness of Christ's blessing. <p>

<bqverse 30>30  Now I urge you, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB512" href="rom_note.htm#fn512"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the Spirit, to join fervently with me in prayer to God on my behalf. 
<bqverse 31>31  Pray<a name="fnB513" href="rom_note.htm#fn513"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea and that my ministry in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints, 
<bqverse 32>32  so that by God's will I may come to you with joy and be refreshed in your company. 
<bqverse 33>33  Now may the God of peace be with all of you. Amen.<a name="fnB514" href="rom_note.htm#fn514"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Personal Greetings</i>
<p><A NAME="16"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Now I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a servant<a name="fnB515" href="rom_note.htm#fn515"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> of the church in Cenchrea, 
<bqverse 2>2  so that you may welcome her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints and provide her with whatever help she may need from you, for she has been a great help to many, including me.<p>

<bqverse 3>3  Greet Prisca and Aquila,<a name="fnB516" href="rom_note.htm#fn516"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,

<bqverse 6>6  Greet Mary, who has worked very hard for you. 
<bqverse 7>7  Greet Andronicus and Junia,<a name="fnB520" href="rom_note.htm#fn520"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> my compatriots<a name="fnB521" href="rom_note.htm#fn521"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> and my fellow prisoners.<a name="fnB522" href="rom_note.htm#fn522"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> They are well known<a name="fnB523" href="rom_note.htm#fn523"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> to the apostles<a name="fnB524" href="rom_note.htm#fn524"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and they were in Christ before me. 
<bqverse 8>8  Greet Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord. 
<bqverse 9>9  Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and my good friend Stachys. 
<bqverse 10>10  Greet Apelles, who is approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus. 
<bqverse 11>11  Greet Herodion, my compatriot.<a name="fnB525" href="rom_note.htm#fn525"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> Greet those in the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord. 
<bqverse 12>12  Greet Tryphena<a name="fnB526" href="rom_note.htm#fn526"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> and Tryphosa, laborers in the Lord. Greet my dear friend<a name="fnB527" href="rom_note.htm#fn527"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> Persis, who has worked hard in the Lord.

<bqverse 14>14  Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers and sisters<a name="fnB529" href="rom_note.htm#fn529"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> with them.

<bqverse 16>16  Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you. <p>

<bqverse 17>17  Now I urge you, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB531" href="rom_note.htm#fn531"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> to watch out for those who create dissensions and obstacles contrary to the teaching that you learned. Avoid them! 
<bqverse 18>18  For these are the kind who do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By their smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds<a name="fnB532" href="rom_note.htm#fn532"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> of the naive. 
<bqverse 19>19  Your obedience is known to all and thus I rejoice over you. But I want you to be wise in what is good and innocent in what is evil. 
<bqverse 20>20  The God of peace will quickly crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you. <p>

<bqverse 21>21  Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you; so do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my compatriots.<a name="fnB533" href="rom_note.htm#fn533"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 26>26  but now is disclosed, and through the prophetic scriptures has been made known to all the nations, according to the command of the eternal God, to bring about the obedience of faith-- 
<bqverse 27>27  to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be glory forever! Amen.</p>
