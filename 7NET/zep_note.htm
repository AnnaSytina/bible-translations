 <a name="fn1" href="zep.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:1) <i>Heb </i>"in the days of." The words "Zephaniah delivered this message" are supplied in the translation for clarification. <br>
 <a name="fn2" href="zep.htm#fnB2"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:2)  The Hebrew text combines the infinitive absolute of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[sa</FONT> ("gather up, sweep away") with a Hiphil prefixed first person form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[ws</FONT> ("come to an end"). (See Jer 8:13 for the same combination.) This can be translated literally, "Sweeping away, I will bring to an end." Some prefer to emend the text so that the infinitive and finite form of the verb are from the same root ("I will certainly sweep away," if from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[sa</FONT> [cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV]; "I will certainly bring to an end," if from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">[ws</FONT>). For a discussion of proposals see J. J. M. Roberts, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah</i>, 167, 169. <br>
 <a name="fn3" href="zep.htm#fnB3"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:3)  <i>Heb</i> "And the stumbling blocks [or, "ruins"] with the evil"; or "the things that make the evil stumble." The line does not appear in the original form of the ancient Greek translation of the OT. It may be a later scribal addition. The present translation assumes the "stumbling blocks" are idolatrous images of animals, birds, and fish. See J. J. M. Roberts, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah</i>, 167, and A. Berlin, <i>Zephaniah</i>, 73-74.<br>

 <a name="fn8" href="zep.htm#fnB8"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:4) <i>Heb </i>"name." Here the "name" is figurative for the memory of those who bear it.<br>
 <a name="fn9" href="zep.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:4)  <i>Heb</i> "of the pagan priests and priests." The first word (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yrmk</FONT>) refers to idolatrous priests in its two other appearances in the OT, while the second word (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;ynhk</FONT>) is the normal term for "priest" and is used of both legitimate and illegitimate priests in the OT. It is likely that the second term, which is omitted in the original form of the Old Greek translation of the OT, is a later scribal addition to the Hebrew text, defining the extremely rare word which precedes. See J. J. M. Roberts, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah</i>, 167-68; cf. also NEB, NRSV. Some argue that both words are original; among the modern English translations that include both are NASB and NIV. Possibly the first word refers to outright pagan priests, while the second has in view once-legitimate priests of the Lord who had drifted into idolatrous practices. Another option is found in A. Berlin, who translates, "the idolatrous priests among the priests," understanding the second word as giving the general category of which the idolatrous priests are a part (<i>Zephaniah</i>, 75).<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="zep.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  The words "I will remove" are repeated from v. 4b for stylistic reasons. In the Hebrew text vv. 4b-6 contain a long list of objects for the verb "I will remove" in v. 4b. In the present translation a new sentence was begun at the beginning of v. 5 in keeping with the tendency of contemporary English to use shorter sentences.<br>
 <a name="fn11" href="zep.htm#fnB11"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:5) <i>Heb </i>"those who worship on their roofs the host of heaven." The "host of heaven" included the sun, moon, planets, and stars, all of which were deified in the ancient Near East.<br>
 <a name="fn12" href="zep.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:5)  The MT reads, "those who worship, those who swear allegiance to the LORD." The original form of the Old Greek translation of the OT omits the phrase "those who worship"; it may have been accidentally repeated from the preceding line. J. J. M. Roberts prefers to delete as secondary the "those who swear allegiance" (<i>Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah</i>, 168).<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="zep.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:5) <i>Heb </i>"those who swear by."<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="zep.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:5)  The referent of "their king" is unclear. It may refer sarcastically to a pagan god (perhaps Baal) worshiped by the people. Some (cf. NEB, NASB, NRSV) prefer to emend the text to "Milcom," the name of an Ammonite god (following some LXX MSS, Syriac, and Vulgate) or "Molek," a god to whom the Israelites offered their children (cf. NIV, NLT). For a discussion of the options, see A. Berlin, <i>Zephaniah</i>, 75-77. <br>
 <a name="fn15" href="zep.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:6) <i>Heb </i>"turn back from [following] after."<br>
 <a name="fn16" href="zep.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:6) <i>Heb </i>"who do not seek the LORD and do not inquire of him." The present translation assumes the first verb refers to praying for divine help and the second to seeking his revealed will through an oracle. Note the usage of the two verbs in 2 Chr 20:3-4. <br>
 <a name="fn17" href="zep.htm#fnB17"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7) <i> Heb</i> "Lord LORD." The phrase <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hw]hy+ yn&#180;d{a&amp;</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">a&amp;d{n&#180;y y+hw]h</FONT>) is customarily rendered by Jewish tradition as "Lord GOD."<br>
 <a name="fn18" href="zep.htm#fnB18"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:7) <i>Heb </i>"the day of the LORD." The origin of the concept of "the day of the LORD" is uncertain. Perhaps it originated in the ancient Near Eastern idea of the sovereign's day of conquest, where a king would boast that he had concluded an entire military campaign in a single day (see D. Stuart, "The Sovereign's Day of Conquest," <i>BASOR</i> 221 [1976]: 159-64). In the OT the expression is applied to several acts of divine judgment, some historical and others still future (see A. J. Everson, "The Days of Yahweh," <i>JBL</i> 93 [1974]: 329-37). In the OT the phrase first appears in Amos (assuming that Amos predates Joel and Obadiah), where it seems to refer to a belief in the northern kingdom that God would intervene on Israel's behalf and judge the nation's enemies. Amos affirms that the Lord's day of judgment is indeed approaching, but he declares that it will be a day of disaster, not deliverance, for Israel. Here in Zephaniah, the "day of the Lord" includes God's coming judgment of Judah, as well as a more universal outpouring of divine anger.<br>
 <a name="fn19" href="zep.htm#fnB19"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  Or "near." <br>
 <a name="fn20" href="zep.htm#fnB20"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7) <i> Heb</i> "a sacrifice" (also in the following verse).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:7)  Because a <i>sacrificial meal</i> presupposes the slaughter of animals, it is used here as a metaphor of the bloody judgment to come. <br>
 <a name="fn21" href="zep.htm#fnB21"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:7)  Or "consecrated."<br>
 <a name="fn22" href="zep.htm#fnB22"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:8)  Or "officials." <br>
 <a name="fn23" href="zep.htm#fnB23"><sup>24</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:8)  The very dress of the royal court, <i>foreign styles of clothing</i>, revealed the degree to which Judah had assimilated foreign customs. <br>
 <a name="fn24" href="zep.htm#fnB24"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:9)  The point of the statement <i>all who hop over the threshold</i> is unclear. Perhaps a ritual or superstition associated with the Philistine god Dagon is in view (see 1 Sam 5:5).<br>
 <a name="fn25" href="zep.htm#fnB25"><sup>26</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:9)  The referent of <i>their master </i>is unclear. Perhaps the king or a pagan god is in view.<br>
 <a name="fn26" href="zep.htm#fnB26"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:9) <i>Heb </i>"who fill...with violence and deceit." The expression "violence and deceit" refers metonymically to the wealth taken by oppressive measures.<br>
 <a name="fn27" href="zep.htm#fnB27"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:10)  The words "will go up" are supplied in the translation for clarification. <br>
 <a name="fn28" href="zep.htm#fnB28"><sup>29</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:10)  The <i>Fish Gate</i> was located on Jerusalem's north side (cf. 2 Chr 33:14; Neh 3:3; 12:39).<br>
 <a name="fn29" href="zep.htm#fnB29"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:10) <i>Heb </i>"from the second area." This may refer to an area northwest of the temple where the rich lived (see A. Berlin, <i>Zephaniah</i>, 86; cf. NASB, NRSV "the Second Quarter"; NIV "the New Quarter").<br>
 <a name="fn30" href="zep.htm#fnB30"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:10) <i>Heb </i>"great breaking." <br>
 <a name="fn31" href="zep.htm#fnB31"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  <i>Heb</i> "in the Mortar." The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vtkm</FONT> ("mortar") is apparently here the name of a low-lying area where economic activity took place.<br>
 <a name="fn32" href="zep.htm#fnB32"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  Or perhaps "Canaanites." Cf. BDB 489 (I, II). Translators have rendered the term either as "the merchant people" (KJV, NKJV), "the traders" (NRSV), "merchants" (NEB, NIV), or, alternatively, "the people of Canaan" (NASB).<br>
 <a name="fn33" href="zep.htm#fnB33"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:11)  Or "be destroyed."<br>
 <a name="fn34" href="zep.htm#fnB34"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:11) <i>Heb </i>"weigh out silver."<br>
 <a name="fn35" href="zep.htm#fnB35"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:11) <i>Heb </i>"be cut off." In the Hebrew text of v. 11b the verbal forms (perfects) emphasize the certainty of the judgment, speaking of it as if it were already accomplished.<br>
 <a name="fn36" href="zep.htm#fnB36"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:12) <i>Heb </i>"who thicken on their sediment." The imagery comes from wine making, where the wine, if allowed to remain on the sediment too long, will thicken into syrup. The image suggests that the people described here were complacent in their sinful behavior and interpreted the delay in judgment as divine apathy. <br>
 <a name="fn37" href="zep.htm#fnB37"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:12) <i>Heb </i>"who say in their hearts."<br>
 <a name="fn38" href="zep.htm#fnB38"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:12) <i>Heb </i>"The LORD does not do good nor does he do evil."<br>
 <a name="fn39" href="zep.htm#fnB39"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:14) <i>Heb </i>"the great day of the LORD." The words "of judgment" are supplied in the translation here and later in this verse for clarity. See the note on the expression "day of judgment" in v. 7.<br>
 <a name="fn40" href="zep.htm#fnB40"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:14) <i>Heb </i>"the sound of the day of the LORD, bitter [is] one crying out there, a warrior." The present translation (a) takes "bitter" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rm</FONT>) with what precedes (contrary to the accentuation of the Hebrew text), (b) understands the participle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">jrx</FONT> (translated, "cry out in battle") as verbal (with "warrior" as subject), (c) takes "there" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;v</FONT>) in a temporal sense, "then, at that time," and (d) understands "warrior" as collective. <br>
 <a name="fn41" href="zep.htm#fnB41"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:15)  <i>Heb</i> "a day of wrath." The word "God's" is supplied in the translation for clarification.<br>
 <a name="fn42" href="zep.htm#fnB42"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:16) <i>Heb </i>"a ram's horn." By metonymy the Hebrew text mentions the trumpet ("ram's horn) in place of the sound it produces ("trumpet blasts").<br>
 <a name="fn43" href="zep.htm#fnB43"><sup>44</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:16)  This description of the day of the LORD consists of an initial reference to <i>anger</i>, followed by four pairs of synonyms. The joining of synonyms in this way emphasizes the degree of the characteristic being described. The first two pairs focus on the <i>distress</i> and <i>ruin</i> that judgment will bring; the second two pairs picture this day of judgment as being very dark (<i>darkness</i>) and exceedingly overcast (<i>gloom</i>). The description concludes with the pairing of two familiar battle sounds, the blast on the ram's horn (<i>trumpet blasts</i>) and the war cries of the warriors (<i>battle cries</i>).<br>
 <a name="fn44" href="zep.htm#fnB44"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:16) <i>Heb </i>"against." The words "judgment will fall" are supplied in the translation for clarification. <br>
 <a name="fn45" href="zep.htm#fnB45"><sup>46</sup></a><b>sn</b> (1:17)  <i>The people</i> refers to mankind in general (see vv. 2-3) or more specifically to the residents of Judah (see vv. 4-13).<br>

 <a name="fn47" href="zep.htm#fnB47"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:17)  Note that some take the referent of "flesh" to be more specific here; cf. NEB ("bowels"), NAB ("brains"), NIV ("entrails").<br>
 <a name="fn48" href="zep.htm#fnB48"><sup>49</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:17)  The words "will be scattered" are supplied in the translation for clarity, based on the parallelism with "will be poured out" in the previous line.<br>
 <a name="fn49" href="zep.htm#fnB49"><sup>50</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:18)  Or "land" (NEB), also at the end of the present verse.<br>
 <a name="fn50" href="zep.htm#fnB50"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:18)  Or "passion"; traditionally, "jealousy."<br>
 <a name="fn51" href="zep.htm#fnB51"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:18)  Or "for."<br>
 <a name="fn52" href="zep.htm#fnB52"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:18) <i>Heb </i>"complete destruction, even terror, he will make."<br>
 <a name="fn53" href="zep.htm#fnB53"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:18)  It is not certain where the LORD's words end and the prophet's words begin. It is possible that Zephaniah begins speaking in the middle of v. 17 or at the beginning of v. 18 (note the third person pronouns referring to the LORD). <br>
 <a name="fn54" href="zep.htm#fnB54"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:1)  The Hebrew text combines a Hitpolel imperative of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">vvq</FONT> with a Qal imperative of the same root. Elsewhere this root appears in the <i>polel</i> stem with the meaning "gather stubble." Zephaniah's command is ironic, implying the people are like stubble or straw. As such, they are vulnerable to the Lord's fiery judgment which will quickly consume them (1:18). See A. Berlin, <i>Zephaniah</i>, 96.<br>
 <a name="fn55" href="zep.htm#fnB55"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:1)  Some relate this word to an Aramaic cognate meaning "to be ashamed." With the negative particle, it would then mean "unashamed" (cf. NIV "shameful"; NRSV "shameless"). However, elsewhere in biblical Hebrew the verb means, "to desire," or with the negative particle, "undesirable." Cf. also NEB "unruly."<br>
 <a name="fn56" href="zep.htm#fnB56"><sup>3</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:2)  <i>Heb</i> "before the giving birth of a decree." For various alternative readings, see J. J. M. Roberts, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah</i>, 187-88.<br>
 <a name="fn57" href="zep.htm#fnB57"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:2)  The second half of the line reads literally, "like chaff it passes by a day." The translation above assumes the "day" is the brief time God is giving the nation to repent. The comparison of this quickly passing opportunity to chaff is consistent with the straw imagery of v. 1.<br>
 <a name="fn58" href="zep.htm#fnB58"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:2) <i>Heb </i>"the fury of the anger of the LORD." The synonyms are combined to emphasize the degree of the Lord's anger, which is extreme.<br>
 <a name="fn59" href="zep.htm#fnB59"><sup>6</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:2) <i>Heb </i>"comes upon" (twice in this verse).<br>
 <a name="fn60" href="zep.htm#fnB60"><sup>7</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:3) <i>Heb </i>"seek the LORD," but "favor" seems to be implied from the final line of the verse.<br>
 <a name="fn61" href="zep.htm#fnB61"><sup>8</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:3)  Or "poor." The precise referent of this Hebrew term is unclear. The word may refer to the economically poor or to the spiritually humble.<br>
 <a name="fn62" href="zep.htm#fnB62"><sup>9</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:3)  The present translation assumes the Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">fpvm</FONT> here refers to God's covenantal requirements and is a synonym for the Law. The word can mean "justice," and could refer more specifically to the principles of justice contained in the Law. In this case the phrase could be translated, "who have promoted the justice God demands." <br>
 <a name="fn63" href="zep.htm#fnB63"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:3) <i>Heb </i>"Seek what is right." <br>
 <a name="fn64" href="zep.htm#fnB64"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:3) <i>Heb </i>"Seek humility." <br>

 <a name="fn67" href="zep.htm#fnB67"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:4)  There is a sound play in the Hebrew text, where the name "Gaza" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hZ&#180;u~</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u~zz*h</FONT>) sounds like the word translated "deserted" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hb&#180;Wzu&amp;</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u&amp;zWb&#180;h</FONT>).<br>

 <a name="fn70" href="zep.htm#fnB70"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:4) <i>Heb </i>"uprooted." There is a sound play in the Hebrew text, where the name "Ekron" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/orq+u#</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">u#q+ro/</FONT>) sounds like the word translated "uprooted" (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rq}u*T}</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">T}u*q}r</FONT>).<br>
 <a name="fn71" href="zep.htm#fnB71"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:5)  <i>Heb</i> "Kerethites," a people settled alongside the Philistines in the coastal areas of southern Palestine (cf. 1 Sam 30:14; Ezek 25:16). They originally came from the island of Crete.<br>
 <a name="fn72" href="zep.htm#fnB72"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:5) <i>Heb </i>"Woe, inhabitants of the coast of sea, nation of Kerethites." The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">wh</FONT>, "ah," "woe," is an alternate form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ywh</FONT>, a word used to mourn the dead and express outwardly one's sorrow. See 1 Kgs 13:30; Jer 22:18; 34:5. By using it here the prophet mourns in advance the downfall of the Philistines, thereby emphasizing the certainty of their demise ("are as good as dead"). Some argue the word does not have its earlier connotation here and is simply an attention-getting interjection, equivalent to "Hey!"<br>
 <a name="fn73" href="zep.htm#fnB73"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:5) <i>Heb </i>"the word of the LORD is against you." <br>

 <a name="fn75" href="zep.htm#fnB75"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6)  The NIV supplies the phrase "where the Kerethites dwell" ["Kerethites" is translated in v. 5 as "the people who came from Crete"] here as an interpretive gloss, but this phrase is not in the Hebrew text. The NAB likewise renders "the coastland of the Cretans," supplying "Cretans" here.<br>
 <a name="fn76" href="zep.htm#fnB76"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:6)  The Hebrew phrase here is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">trk twn</FONT>. The first word is probably a plural form of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwn</FONT>, "pasture." The meaning of the second word is unclear. It may be a synonym of the preceding word (cf. NRSV "pastures, meadows for shepherds"; there is a word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rk</FONT> ["pasture"] in biblical Hebrew, but elsewhere it forms its plural with a masculine ending), though some have suggested a meaning "wells" or "caves" (used as shelters; cf. NEB "shepherds' huts"). In this case, one might translate, "The seacoast will be used for pasturelands; for shepherds' wells/caves." <br>

Perhaps it refers back to the "pasture lands," though this noun is feminine. It is preferable to emend the text (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;hylu</FONT>) to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yh lu</FONT>, "by the sea," an emendation that assumes a misdivision and transposition of letters in the Hebrew text (cf.

 <a name="fn80" href="zep.htm#fnB80"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:7)  The referent of the pronominal subject ("they") is unclear. It may refer (1) to the shepherds (in which case the first verb should be translated, "pasture their sheep," cf. NEB), or (2) to the Judahites occupying the area, who are being compared to sheep (cf. NIV, "there they will find pasture").<br>

If the meaning is indeed "weaken," then this line may be referring to the reduction of these gods' territory through conquest (see A. Berlin, <i>Zephaniah</i>, 110-11). Cf.

 <a name="fn104" href="zep.htm#fnB104"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:14)  The Hebrew text reads here <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dpq-&lt;g taq-&lt;g</FONT>. The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">taq</FONT> refers to some type of bird (see Lev 11:18; Deut 14:17) that was typically found near ruins (Isa 34:11); one of the most common translations is "owl" (cf. NEB "horned owl"; NIV, NRSV "desert owl"; <i>contra</i> NASB "pelican"). The term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dpq</FONT> may also refer to a type of bird (cf. NEB "ruffed bustard"; NIV, NRSV "screech owl"), but some suggest a rodent may be in view (cf. NASB "hedgehog"). (A rodent or some other small animal would be able to sleep in the tops of pillars because the pillars would be lying in the ruins of the fallen buildings.)<br>
 <a name="fn105" href="zep.htm#fnB105"><sup>52</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:14) <i>Heb </i>"a sound will sing in the window." If a type of owl is in view, "hoot" is a more appropriate translation (cf. NEB, NRSV). <br>

"Rubble" translates the Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">brj</FONT>, "desolation." Some emend to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bru</FONT> ("raven") following the LXX and Vg; A.

 <a name="fn107" href="zep.htm#fnB107"><sup>54</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:14)  The meaning of the Hebrew word translated "cedar work" (so NASB, NRSV) is unclear; NIV has "the beams of cedar."<br>
 <a name="fn108" href="zep.htm#fnB108"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn </b> (2:14) <i>Heb </i>"one will expose." The subject is probably indefinite, though one could translate, "for he [i.e., God] will lay bare."<br>

 <a name="fn115" href="zep.htm#fnB115"><sup>1</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:1)  The present translation assumes <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">harm</FONT> is derived from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yar</FONT>, "excrement," a noun attested in post-biblical Hebrew. The following participle, "stained," supports this interpretation (cf. NEB "filthy and foul"; NRSV "soiled, defiled"). Another option is to derive the form from <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hrm</FONT>, "to rebel"; in this case the term should be translated "rebellious" (cf. NASB, NIV "rebellious and defiled"). This idea is supported by v. 2. For discussion of the two options, see <i>HALOT</i> 630 and J. J. M. Roberts, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah</i>, 206.<br>
 <a name="fn116" href="zep.htm#fnB116"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:1)  <i>Heb</i> "Woe, soiled and stained one, oppressive city." The verb "is finished" is supplied in the second line. On the Hebrew word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ywh</FONT>, "woe," "ah," see the note on the word "dead" in 2:5.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:1)  The following verses show that Jerusalem, personified as a woman ("she"), is the referent.<br>

 <a name="fn118" href="zep.htm#fnB118"><sup>4</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:2) <i>Heb </i>"she does not receive correction." The Hebrew phrase, when negated, refers elsewhere to rejecting verbal advice (Jer 17:23; 32:33; 35:13) and refusing to learn from experience (Jer 2:30; 5:3). <br>
 <a name="fn119" href="zep.htm#fnB119"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:2) <i>Heb </i>"draw near to." The present translation assumes the expression "draw near to" refers to seeking God's will (see 1 Sam 14:36). <br>

The translation assumes an emendation to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hbru</FONT> ("desert"). For a discussion of this and other options, see A. Berlin, <i>Zephaniah</i>, 128. The metaphor has been translated as a simile ("as hungry as") for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn124" href="zep.htm#fnB124"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:3) <i>Heb </i>"they do not gnaw [a bone] at morning." The precise meaning of the line is unclear. Perhaps the statement means these wolves devour their prey so completely that not even a bone is left to gnaw by the time morning arrives. For a discussion of this and other options, see A. Berlin, <i>Zephaniah</i>, 129.<br>
 <a name="fn125" href="zep.htm#fnB125"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:4) <i>Heb </i>"her prophets are proud." Applied to prophets, the word <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;yzjp</FONT> ("proud") probably refers to their audacity in passing off their own words as genuine prophecies from the LORD (see Jer 23:32).<br>

 <a name="fn141" href="zep.htm#fnB141"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:7) <i>Heb </i>"But they got up early, they made corrupt all their actions." The phrase "they got up early" probably refers to their eagerness to engage in sinful activities.<br>
 <a name="fn142" href="zep.htm#fnB142"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:8)  The second person verb form ("you must wait patiently") is masculine plural, indicating that a group is being addressed. Perhaps the humble individuals addressed earlier (see 2:3) are in view. Because of Jerusalem's sin, they must patiently wait for judgment to pass before their vindication arrives.<br>
 <a name="fn143" href="zep.htm#fnB143"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:8) <i>Heb </i>"when I arise for plunder." The present translation takes <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">du^ </FONT>as "plunder." Some, following the LXX, repoint the term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">du@</FONT> and translate, "as a witness" (cf. NASB, NIV, NRSV). In this case the Lord uses a legal metaphor to picture himself as testifying against his enemies. A. Berlin takes <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dul</FONT> in a temporal sense ("forever") and translates "once and for all" (<i>Zephaniah</i>, 133).<br>

Perhaps the text is corrupt at this point or a proper name should be understood. For a discussion of various options see A. Berlin, <i>Zephaniah</i>, 134-35.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:10)  It is not certain if <i>those who pray to me</i> refers to the converted nations or to God's exiled covenant people.<br>

 <a name="fn162" href="zep.htm#fnB162"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tc</b> (3:17)  The MT reads, "he is silent in his love," but this makes no sense in light of the immediately preceding and following lines. Some take the Hiphil verb form as causative (see Job 11:3), rather than intransitive, and translate, "he causes [you] to be silent by his love," that is, "he soothes [you] by his love."

Any translation of this difficult verse must be provisional at best.

 <a name="fn165" href="zep.htm#fnB165"><sup>51</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:19)  The word "sheep" is supplied for clarification. As in Mic 4:6-7, the exiles are here pictured as injured and scattered sheep whom the divine shepherd rescues from danger. <br>

 <a name="fn167" href="zep.htm#fnB167"><sup>53</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:20)  In this line the second person pronoun is masculine plural, indicating that the exiles are addressed.<br>
