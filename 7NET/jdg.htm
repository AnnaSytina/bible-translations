<a name="_Toc494011815"></a><p><i>Judah T akes the Lead</i>
<p><A NAME="1"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> After Joshua died, the Israelites asked<a name="fnB0" href="jdg_note.htm#fn0"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD, "Who should lead the invasion against the Canaanites and launch the attack?"<a name="fnB1" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  The LORD said, "The men of Judah should take the lead.<a name="fnB2" href="jdg_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> Be sure of this! I am handing the land over to them."<a name="fnB3" href="jdg_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  The men of Judah said to their brothers, the men of Simeon,<a name="fnB4" href="jdg_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> "Invade our allotted land with us and help us attack the Canaanites.<a name="fnB5" href="jdg_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> Then we<a name="fnB6" href="jdg_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> will go with you into your allotted land." So the men of Simeon went with them.<p>

<bqverse 4>4  The men of Judah attacked,<a name="fnB7" href="jdg_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> and the LORD handed the Canaanites and Perizzites over to them. They killed ten thousand men at Bezek. 
<bqverse 5>5  They met<a name="fnB8" href="jdg_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> Adoni-Bezek at Bezek and fought him. They defeated the Canaanites and Perizzites. 
<bqverse 6>6  When Adoni-Bezek ran away, they chased him and captured him. Then they cut off his thumbs and big toes. 
<bqverse 7>7  Adoni-Bezek said, "Seventy kings, with thumbs and big toes cut off, used to lick up<a name="fnB9" href="jdg_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> food scraps<a name="fnB10" href="jdg_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> under my table. God has repaid me for what I did to them."<a name="fnB11" href="jdg_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> They brought him to Jerusalem, where he died. 
<bqverse 8>8  The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem and captured it. They put the sword to it and set the city on fire. <p>

<bqverse 9>9  Later the men of Judah went down to attack the Canaanites living in the hill country, the Negev, and the lowlands.<a name="fnB12" href="jdg_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  The men of Judah attacked the Canaanites living in Hebron. (Hebron used to be called Kiriath Arba.) They killed Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai. 
<bqverse 11>11  From there they attacked the people of Debir.<a name="fnB13" href="jdg_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> (Debir used to be called Kiriath Sepher.) 
<bqverse 12>12  Caleb said, "To the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher I will give my daughter Acsah as a wife." 
<bqverse 13>13  When Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother,<a name="fnB14" href="jdg_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> captured it, Caleb<a name="fnB15" href="jdg_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> gave him his daughter Acsah as a wife. <p>

<bqverse 14>14  One time Acsah<a name="fnB16" href="jdg_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> came and charmed her father<a name="fnB17" href="jdg_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> so she could ask him for some land. When she got down from her donkey, Caleb said to her, "What would you like?" 
<bqverse 15>15  She answered, "Please give me a special present.<a name="fnB18" href="jdg_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> Since you have given me land in the Negev, now give me springs of water." So Caleb gave her both the upper and lower springs.<a name="fnB19" href="jdg_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 16>16  Now the descendants of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up with the people of Judah from the City of Date Palm Trees to Arad in the desert of Judah,<a name="fnB20" href="jdg_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> located in the Negev.<a name="fnB21" href="jdg_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> They went and lived with the people of Judah.<a name="fnB22" href="jdg_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 17>17  The men of Judah went with their brothers the men of Simeon<a name="fnB23" href="jdg_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> and defeated the Canaanites living in Zephath. They wiped out Zephath.<a name="fnB24" href="jdg_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> So people now call the city Hormah.<a name="fnB25" href="jdg_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  The men of Judah captured Gaza, Ashkelon, Ekron, and the territory surrounding each of these cities.<a name="fnB26" href="jdg_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 19>19  The LORD was with the men of Judah. They conquered<a name="fnB27" href="jdg_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> the hill country, but they could not<a name="fnB28" href="jdg_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> conquer the people living in the coastal plain, because they had chariots with iron-rimmed wheels.<a name="fnB29" href="jdg_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  Caleb received<a name="fnB30" href="jdg_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> Hebron, just as Moses had promised. He drove out the three Anakites. 
<bqverse 21>21  The men of Benjamin, however, did not conquer the Jebusites living in Jerusalem. The Jebusites live with the people of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this very day.<a name="fnB31" href="jdg_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> <a name="_Toc494011816"></a></p>
<p><i>Partial Success</i>
<p>
<bqverse 22>22 When the men<a name="fnB32" href="jdg_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> of Joseph attacked<a name="fnB33" href="jdg_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> Bethel, the LORD was with them. 
<bqverse 23>23  When the men of Joseph spied out Bethel (it used to be called Luz), 
<bqverse 24>24  the spies spotted<a name="fnB34" href="jdg_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> a man leaving the city. They said to him, "If you show us a secret entrance into the city, we will reward you." 
<bqverse 25>25  He showed them a secret entrance into the city, and they put the city to the sword. But they let the man and his extended family leave safely. 
<bqverse 26>26  He<a name="fnB35" href="jdg_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> moved to Hittite country and built a city. He named it Luz, and it has kept that name to this very day. <p>

<bqverse 27>27  The men of Manasseh did not conquer Beth Shan, Taanach, or their surrounding towns. Nor did they conquer the people living in Dor, Ibleam, Megiddo or their surrounding towns.<a name="fnB36" href="jdg_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> The Canaanites managed<a name="fnB37" href="jdg_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> to remain in those areas.<a name="fnB38" href="jdg_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  Whenever Israel was strong militarily, they forced the Canaanites to do hard labor, but they never totally conquered them.<p>

<bqverse 29>29  The men of Ephraim did not conquer the Canaanites living in Gezer. The Canaanites lived among them in Gezer. <p>

<bqverse 30>30  The men of Zebulun did not conquer the people living in Kitron and Nahalol.<a name="fnB39" href="jdg_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> The Canaanites lived among them and were forced to do hard labor.<p>

<bqverse 31>31  The men of Asher did not conquer the people living in Acco or Sidon. Nor did they conquer Ahlab, Aczib, Helbah, Aphek, or Rehob.<a name="fnB40" href="jdg_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 32>32  The people of Asher live among the Canaanites residing in the land because they did not conquer them.<p>

<bqverse 33>33  The men of Naphtali did not conquer the people living in Beth Shemesh or Beth Anath.<a name="fnB41" href="jdg_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> They live among the Canaanites residing in the land. The Canaanites<a name="fnB42" href="jdg_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> living in Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath were forced to do hard labor for them.<p>

<bqverse 34>34  The Amorites forced the people of Dan to live in the hill country. They did not allow them to live in<a name="fnB43" href="jdg_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> the coastal plain. 
<bqverse 35>35  The Amorites managed<a name="fnB44" href="jdg_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> to remain in Har Heres,<a name="fnB45" href="jdg_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> Aijalon, and Shaalbim. Whenever the tribe of Joseph was strong militarily,<a name="fnB46" href="jdg_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> the Amorites were forced to do hard labor. 
<bqverse 36>36  The border of Amorite territory ran from the Pass of the Scorpions<a name="fnB47" href="jdg_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> to Sela and on up.<a name="fnB48" href="jdg_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqchapter 2>
<a name="_Toc494011817"></a></p>
<p><i>A Tearful Encounter at Bokim</i>
<p><A NAME="2"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> The LORD's angelic messenger<a name="fnB49" href="jdg_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> went up from Gilgal to Bokim. He said, "I brought you up from Egypt and led you into the land I had solemnly promised to give to your ancestors.<a name="fnB50" href="jdg_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> I said, `I will never break my agreement<a name="fnB51" href="jdg_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> with you, 
<bqverse 2>2  but you must not make an agreement with the people who live in this land. You should tear down the altars where they worship.'<a name="fnB52" href="jdg_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> But you have disobeyed me.<a name="fnB53" href="jdg_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> Why would you do such a thing?<a name="fnB54" href="jdg_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  At that time I also warned you,<a name="fnB55" href="jdg_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> `If you disobey,<a name="fnB56" href="jdg_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> I will not drive out the Canaanites<a name="fnB57" href="jdg_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> before you. They will ensnare you<a name="fnB58" href="jdg_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and their gods will lure you away.'"<a name="fnB59" href="jdg_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 4>4  When the LORD's messenger finished speaking these words to all the Israelites, the people wept loudly.<a name="fnB60" href="jdg_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  They named that place Bokim<a name="fnB61" href="jdg_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> and offered sacrifices to the LORD there.<a name="_Toc494011818"></a></p>
<p><i>The End of an Era</i>
<p>
<bqverse 6>6  When Joshua dismissed<a name="fnB62" href="jdg_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> the people, the Israelites went to their allotted portions of property,<a name="fnB63" href="jdg_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> intending to take possession of the land. 
<bqverse 7>7  The people worshiped<a name="fnB64" href="jdg_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD throughout Joshua's lifetime and as long as the elderly men<a name="fnB65" href="jdg_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> who outlived him remained alive. These men had witnessed<a name="fnB66" href="jdg_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> all the great things the LORD had done for Israel.<a name="fnB67" href="jdg_note.htm#fn67"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  Joshua son of Nun, the LORD's servant, died at the age of one hundred and ten. 
<bqverse 9>9  The people<a name="fnB68" href="jdg_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> buried him in his allotted land<a name="fnB69" href="jdg_note.htm#fn69"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> in Timnath Heres in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. 
<bqverse 10>10  That entire generation passed away;<a name="fnB70" href="jdg_note.htm#fn70"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> a new generation came along<a name="fnB71" href="jdg_note.htm#fn71"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> that had not personally experienced the LORD's presence or seen what he had done for Israel.<a name="fnB72" href="jdg_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494011819"></a></p>
<p><i>A Monotonous Cycle</i>
<p>
<bqverse 11>11  The Israelites did evil before<a name="fnB73" href="jdg_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD by worshiping<a name="fnB74" href="jdg_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> the Baals. 
<bqverse 12>12  They abandoned the LORD God of their ancestors<a name="fnB75" href="jdg_note.htm#fn75"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> who brought them out of the land of Egypt. They followed other gods--the gods of the nations who lived around them. They worshiped<a name="fnB76" href="jdg_note.htm#fn76"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> them and made the LORD angry. 
<bqverse 13>13  They abandoned the LORD and worshiped Baal and the Ashtars.<a name="fnB77" href="jdg_note.htm#fn77"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 14>14  The LORD was furious with Israel<a name="fnB78" href="jdg_note.htm#fn78"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> and handed them over to robbers who plundered them.<a name="fnB79" href="jdg_note.htm#fn79"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> He turned them over to<a name="fnB80" href="jdg_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> their enemies who lived around them. They could not withstand their enemies' attacks.<a name="fnB81" href="jdg_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  Whenever they went out to fight,<a name="fnB82" href="jdg_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD did them harm,<a name="fnB83" href="jdg_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> just as he had warned and solemnly vowed he would do.<a name="fnB84" href="jdg_note.htm#fn84"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> They suffered greatly.<a name="fnB85" href="jdg_note.htm#fn85"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 16>16  The LORD raised up leaders<a name="fnB86" href="jdg_note.htm#fn86"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> who delivered them from these robbers.<a name="fnB87" href="jdg_note.htm#fn87"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  But they did not obey<a name="fnB88" href="jdg_note.htm#fn88"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> their leaders. Instead they prostituted themselves to other gods and worshiped<a name="fnB89" href="jdg_note.htm#fn89"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> them. They quickly turned aside from the path<a name="fnB90" href="jdg_note.htm#fn90"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> their ancestors<a name="fnB91" href="jdg_note.htm#fn91"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> had walked. Their ancestors had obeyed the LORD's commands, but they did not.<a name="fnB92" href="jdg_note.htm#fn92"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  When the LORD raised up leaders for them, the LORD was with each leader and delivered the people<a name="fnB93" href="jdg_note.htm#fn93"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> from their enemies while the leader remained alive. The LORD felt sorry for them<a name="fnB94" href="jdg_note.htm#fn94"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> when they cried out in agony because of what their harsh oppressors did to them.<a name="fnB95" href="jdg_note.htm#fn95"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19 When a leader died, the next generation<a name="fnB96" href="jdg_note.htm#fn96"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> would again<a name="fnB97" href="jdg_note.htm#fn97"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> act more wickedly than the previous one.<a name="fnB98" href="jdg_note.htm#fn98"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> They would follow after other gods, worshiping them<a name="fnB99" href="jdg_note.htm#fn99"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> and bowing down to them. They did not give up<a name="fnB100" href="jdg_note.htm#fn100"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> their practices or their stubborn ways.<a name="_Toc494011820"></a></p>
<p><i>A Divine Decision</i>
<p>
<bqverse 20>20  The LORD was furious with Israel.<a name="fnB101" href="jdg_note.htm#fn101"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> He said, "This nation<a name="fnB102" href="jdg_note.htm#fn102"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> has violated the terms of the agreement I made with their ancestors<a name="fnB103" href="jdg_note.htm#fn103"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> by disobeying me.<a name="fnB104" href="jdg_note.htm#fn104"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  So I will no longer remove before them any of the nations that Joshua left unconquered when he died. 
<bqverse 22>22  Joshua left those nations<a name="fnB105" href="jdg_note.htm#fn105"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> to test<a name="fnB106" href="jdg_note.htm#fn106"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> Israel. I wanted to see<a name="fnB107" href="jdg_note.htm#fn107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> whether or not the people<a name="fnB108" href="jdg_note.htm#fn108"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> would carefully walk in the path<a name="fnB109" href="jdg_note.htm#fn109"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> marked out by<a name="fnB110" href="jdg_note.htm#fn110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD, as their ancestors<a name="fnB111" href="jdg_note.htm#fn111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> were careful to do." 
<bqverse 23>23  This is why<a name="fnB112" href="jdg_note.htm#fn112"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> the LORD permitted these nations to remain and did not conquer them immediately;<a name="fnB113" href="jdg_note.htm#fn113"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> he did not hand them over to Joshua.<p>

<bqchapter 3><A NAME="3"><b>

<bqverse 13>13  Eglon allied with<a name="fnB134" href="jdg_note.htm#fn134"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> the Ammonites and Amalekites. He came and defeated Israel, and they seized the City of Date Palm Trees. 
<bqverse 14>14  The Israelites were subject to<a name="fnB135" href="jdg_note.htm#fn135"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> King Eglon of Moab for eighteen years.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  When the Israelites cried out for help to the LORD, he<a name="fnB136" href="jdg_note.htm#fn136"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> raised up a deliverer for them. His name was Ehud son of Gera the Benjaminite, a left-handed man.<a name="fnB137" href="jdg_note.htm#fn137"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> The Israelites sent him to King Eglon of Moab with their tribute payment.<a name="fnB138" href="jdg_note.htm#fn138"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  Ehud made himself a sword--it had two edges and was eighteen inches long.<a name="fnB139" href="jdg_note.htm#fn139"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> He strapped it under his coat on his right thigh. 
<bqverse 17>17  He brought the tribute payment to King Eglon of Moab. (Now Eglon was a very fat man.)<p>

<bqverse 18>18  After Ehud brought the tribute payment, he dismissed the people who had carried it.<a name="fnB140" href="jdg_note.htm#fn140"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  But he went back<a name="fnB141" href="jdg_note.htm#fn141"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> once he reached<a name="fnB142" href="jdg_note.htm#fn142"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> the carved images<a name="fnB143" href="jdg_note.htm#fn143"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> at Gilgal. He said to Eglon,<a name="fnB144" href="jdg_note.htm#fn144"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> "I have a secret message for you, O king." Eglon<a name="fnB145" href="jdg_note.htm#fn145"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> said, "Be quiet!"<a name="fnB146" href="jdg_note.htm#fn146"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> All his attendants left. 
<bqverse 20>20  When Ehud approached him, he was sitting in his well-ventilated<a name="fnB147" href="jdg_note.htm#fn147"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> upper room all by himself. Ehud said, "I have a divine message<a name="fnB148" href="jdg_note.htm#fn148"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> for you." When Eglon rose up from his seat,<a name="fnB149" href="jdg_note.htm#fn149"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  Ehud reached with his left hand, pulled the sword from his right thigh, and drove it into Eglon's<a name="fnB150" href="jdg_note.htm#fn150"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> belly. 
<bqverse 22>22  The handle went in after the blade, and the fat closed around the blade, for Ehud<a name="fnB151" href="jdg_note.htm#fn151"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> did not pull the sword out of his belly.<a name="fnB152" href="jdg_note.htm#fn152"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23  As Ehud went out into the vestibule,<a name="fnB153" href="jdg_note.htm#fn153"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> he closed the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them.<p>

<bqverse 24>24  When Ehud had left, Eglon's<a name="fnB154" href="jdg_note.htm#fn154"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> servants came and saw the locked doors of the upper room. They said, "He must be relieving himself<a name="fnB155" href="jdg_note.htm#fn155"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> in the well-ventilated inner room."<a name="fnB156" href="jdg_note.htm#fn156"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  They waited so long they were embarrassed, but he still did not open the doors of the upper room. Finally they took the key and opened the doors.<a name="fnB157" href="jdg_note.htm#fn157"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> Right before their eyes was their master, sprawled out dead on the floor!<a name="fnB158" href="jdg_note.htm#fn158"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  Now Ehud had escaped while they were delaying. When he passed the carved images, he escaped to Seirah.<p>

<bqverse 27>27  When he reached Seirah,<a name="fnB159" href="jdg_note.htm#fn159"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> he blew a trumpet<a name="fnB160" href="jdg_note.htm#fn160"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> in the Ephraimite hill country. The Israelites went down with him from the hill country, with Ehud in the lead.<a name="fnB161" href="jdg_note.htm#fn161"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  He said to them, "Follow me, for the LORD is about to defeat your enemies, the Moabites!"<a name="fnB162" href="jdg_note.htm#fn162"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> They followed him, captured the fords of the Jordan River<a name="fnB163" href="jdg_note.htm#fn163"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> opposite Moab,<a name="fnB164" href="jdg_note.htm#fn164"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> and did not let anyone cross. 
<bqverse 29>29  That day they killed about ten thousand Moabites<a name="fnB165" href="jdg_note.htm#fn165"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a>--all strong, capable warriors; not one escaped. 
<bqverse 30>30  Israel humiliated Moab that day, and the land had rest for eighty years. <p>

<bqverse 31>31  After Ehud<a name="fnB166" href="jdg_note.htm#fn166"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> came<a name="fnB167" href="jdg_note.htm#fn167"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> Shamgar son of Anath; he killed six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad and, like Ehud,<a name="fnB168" href="jdg_note.htm#fn168"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> delivered Israel.

<bqverse 4>4  Now Deborah, a prophetess,<a name="fnB176" href="jdg_note.htm#fn176"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> wife of Lappidoth, was<a name="fnB177" href="jdg_note.htm#fn177"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> leading<a name="fnB178" href="jdg_note.htm#fn178"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> Israel at that time.

<bqverse 16>16  Now Barak chased the chariots and the army all the way to Harosheth Haggoyim.

<bqverse 17>17  Now Sisera ran away on foot to the tent of Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite, for King Jabin of Hazor and the family of Heber the Kenite had made a peace treaty.<a name="fnB200" href="jdg_note.htm#fn200"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  Jael came out to welcome Sisera. She said to him, "Stop and rest,<a name="fnB201" href="jdg_note.htm#fn201"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> my lord.

<bqverse 19>19  He said to her, "Give me a little water to drink, because I'm thirsty." She opened a goatskin container of milk and gave him some milk to drink. Then she covered him up again. 
<bqverse 20>20  He said to her, "Stand watch at the entrance to the tent. If anyone comes along and asks you, `Is there a man here?' say `No.'" 
<bqverse 21>21  Then Jael wife of Heber took a tent peg in one hand and a hammer in the other.<a name="fnB203" href="jdg_note.htm#fn203"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> She crept up on him, drove the tent peg through his temple into the ground<a name="fnB204" href="jdg_note.htm#fn204"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> while he was asleep from exhaustion,<a name="fnB205" href="jdg_note.htm#fn205"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> and he died. 
<bqverse 22>22  Now Barak was chasing Sisera. Jael went out to welcome him. She said to him, "Come here and I will show you the man you are searching for." He went with her into the tent,<a name="fnB206" href="jdg_note.htm#fn206"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> and there he saw Sisera sprawled out dead<a name="fnB207" href="jdg_note.htm#fn207"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> with the tent peg in his temple.<p>

<bqverse 23>23  That day God humiliated King Jabin of Canaan, before the Israelites.

<bqverse 20>20  God's messenger said to him, "Put the meat and unleavened bread on this rock,<a name="fnB341" href="jdg_note.htm#fn341"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> and pour out the broth."

<bqverse 22>22  When Gideon realized<a name="fnB345" href="jdg_note.htm#fn345"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> that it was the LORD's messenger, he<a name="fnB346" href="jdg_note.htm#fn346"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> said, "Oh no!<a name="fnB347" href="jdg_note.htm#fn347"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> Master, LORD!<a name="fnB348" href="jdg_note.htm#fn348"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> I have seen the LORD's messenger face to face!" 
<bqverse 23>23  The LORD said to him, "You are safe!<a name="fnB349" href="jdg_note.htm#fn349"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> Do not be afraid! You are not going to die!" 
<bqverse 24>24  Gideon built an altar for the LORD there, and named it "The LORD is on friendly terms with me."<a name="fnB350" href="jdg_note.htm#fn350"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> To this day it is still there in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.<a name="_Toc494011827"></a></p>
<p><i>Gideon Destroys the Altar</i>
<p>
<bqverse 25>25  That night the LORD said to him, "Take the bull from your father's herd, as well as a second bull, one that is seven years old.<a name="fnB351" href="jdg_note.htm#fn351"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> Pull down your father's Baal altar and cut down the nearby Asherah pole. 
<bqverse 26>26  Then build an altar for the LORD your God on the top of this stronghold according to the proper pattern.<a name="fnB352" href="jdg_note.htm#fn352"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> Take the second bull and offer it as a burnt sacrifice on the wood from the Asherah pole that you cut down." 
<bqverse 27>27  So Gideon took ten of his servants<a name="fnB353" href="jdg_note.htm#fn353"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> and did just as the LORD had told him. He was too afraid of his father's family<a name="fnB354" href="jdg_note.htm#fn354"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> and the men of the city to do it in broad daylight, so he waited until nighttime.<a name="fnB355" href="jdg_note.htm#fn355"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 28>28  When the men of the city got up the next morning, they saw<a name="fnB356" href="jdg_note.htm#fn356"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> the Baal altar pulled down, the nearby Asherah pole cut down, and the second bull sacrificed on the newly built altar. 
<bqverse 29>29  They said to one another,<a name="fnB357" href="jdg_note.htm#fn357"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> "Who did this?"<a name="fnB358" href="jdg_note.htm#fn358"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> They investigated the matter thoroughly<a name="fnB359" href="jdg_note.htm#fn359"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a> and concluded<a name="fnB360" href="jdg_note.htm#fn360"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> that Gideon son of Joash had done it. 
<bqverse 30>30  The men of the city said to Joash, "Bring out your son, so we can execute him!<a name="fnB361" href="jdg_note.htm#fn361"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a> He pulled down the Baal altar and cut down the nearby Asherah pole." 
<bqverse 31>31  But Joash said to all those who confronted him,<a name="fnB362" href="jdg_note.htm#fn362"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>69</SUP></FONT></a> "Must you fight Baal's battles?<a name="fnB363" href="jdg_note.htm#fn363"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>70</SUP></FONT></a> Must you rescue him?

<bqverse 32>32  That very day Gideon's father named him Jerub-Baal,<a name="fnB368" href="jdg_note.htm#fn368"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>75</SUP></FONT></a> because he had said, "Let Baal fight with him, for it was his altar that was pulled down."<a name="_Toc494011828"></a></p>

<bqverse 10>10  But if you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with Purah your servant

<bqverse 7>7  Gideon said, "Since you will not help,<a name="fnB460" href="jdg_note.htm#fn460"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> after the LORD hands Zebah and Zalmunna over to me, I will thresh<a name="fnB461" href="jdg_note.htm#fn461"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> your skin<a name="fnB462" href="jdg_note.htm#fn462"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> with<a name="fnB463" href="jdg_note.htm#fn463"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> desert thorns and briers."

<bqverse 9>9  He also threatened<a name="fnB466" href="jdg_note.htm#fn466"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> the men of Penuel, warning,<a name="fnB467" href="jdg_note.htm#fn467"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> "When I return victoriously,<a name="fnB468" href="jdg_note.htm#fn468"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> I will tear down this tower."<p>

<bqverse 10>10  Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their armies.

<bqverse 11>11  Gideon went up the road of the nomads<a name="fnB470" href="jdg_note.htm#fn470"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> east of Nobah and Jogbehah and ambushed the surprised army.<a name="fnB471" href="jdg_note.htm#fn471"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a>

He had surprised<a name="fnB473" href="jdg_note.htm#fn473"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> their entire army.<p>

<bqverse 13>13  Gideon son of Joash returned from the battle by the pass<a name="fnB474" href="jdg_note.htm#fn474"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> of Heres. 
<bqverse 14>14  He captured a young man from Succoth<a name="fnB475" href="jdg_note.htm#fn475"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> and interrogated him.

<bqverse 15>15  He approached the men of Succoth and said, "Look what I have!<a name="fnB477" href="jdg_note.htm#fn477"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> Zebah and Zalmunna!

<bqverse 17>17  He also tore down the tower of Penuel and executed the city's men.<p>

<bqverse 18>18  He said to Zebah and Zalmunna, "Describe for me<a name="fnB481" href="jdg_note.htm#fn481"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> the men you killed at Tabor."

<bqverse 19>19  He said, "They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. I swear,<a name="fnB483" href="jdg_note.htm#fn483"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> as surely as the LORD is alive, if you had let them live, I would not kill you." 
<bqverse 20>20  He ordered Jether his firstborn son, "Come on!<a name="fnB484" href="jdg_note.htm#fn484"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> Kill them!" But Jether was too afraid to draw his sword,<a name="fnB485" href="jdg_note.htm#fn485"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> because he was still young. 
<bqverse 21>21  Zebah and Zalmunna said to Gideon,<a name="fnB486" href="jdg_note.htm#fn486"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> "Come on,<a name="fnB487" href="jdg_note.htm#fn487"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> you strike us, for a man is judged by his strength."<a name="fnB488" href="jdg_note.htm#fn488"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> So Gideon killed<a name="fnB489" href="jdg_note.htm#fn489"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the crescent-shaped ornaments which were on the necks of their camels.<a name="_Toc494011834"></a></p>
<p><i>Gideon Rejects a Crown but Makes an Ephod</i>
<p>
<bqverse 22>22  The men of Israel said to Gideon, "Rule over us--you, your son, and your grandson. For you have delivered us from Midian's power."<a name="fnB490" href="jdg_note.htm#fn490"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23  Gideon said to them, "I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. The LORD will rule over you." 
<bqverse 24>24  Gideon continued,<a name="fnB491" href="jdg_note.htm#fn491"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> "I would like to make one request.

<bqverse 25>25  They said, "We are happy to give you earrings."<a name="fnB494" href="jdg_note.htm#fn494"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> So they<a name="fnB495" href="jdg_note.htm#fn495"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> spread out a garment, and each one threw an earring from his plunder onto it. 
<bqverse 26>26  The total weight of the gold earrings he requested came to seventeen hundred gold shekels.<a name="fnB496" href="jdg_note.htm#fn496"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> This was in addition to the crescent-shaped ornaments, jewelry,<a name="fnB497" href="jdg_note.htm#fn497"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> purple clothing worn by the Midianite kings, and the necklaces on the camels.<a name="fnB498" href="jdg_note.htm#fn498"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  Gideon used all this to make<a name="fnB499" href="jdg_note.htm#fn499"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> an ephod,<a name="fnB500" href="jdg_note.htm#fn500"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> which he put in his hometown of Ophrah. All the Israelites<a name="fnB501" href="jdg_note.htm#fn501"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> prostituted themselves to it there. It became a snare to Gideon and his family. <a name="_Toc494011835"></a></p>
<p><i>Gideon's Story Ends</i>

<bqverse 28>28  The Israelites humiliated Midian; the Midianites' fighting spirit was broken.<a name="fnB502" href="jdg_note.htm#fn502"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> The land had rest for forty years during Gideon's time.<a name="fnB503" href="jdg_note.htm#fn503"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 29>29  Then Jerub-Baal son of Joash went home and settled down.<a name="fnB504" href="jdg_note.htm#fn504"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 30>30  Gideon fathered seventy sons through his many wives.<a name="fnB505" href="jdg_note.htm#fn505"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 32>32  Gideon son of Joash died at a very<a name="fnB508" href="jdg_note.htm#fn508"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash located in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.<a name="_Toc494011836"></a></p>
<p><i>Israel Returns to Baal-Worship </i>
<p>
<bqverse 33>33  After Gideon died, the Israelites again prostituted themselves to the Baals. They made Baal-Berith<a name="fnB509" href="jdg_note.htm#fn509"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> their god.

<bqverse 29>29  If only these men<a name="fnB570" href="jdg_note.htm#fn570"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> were under my command,<a name="fnB571" href="jdg_note.htm#fn571"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> I would get rid of Abimelech!"

<bqverse 30>30  When Zebul, the city commissioner, heard the words of Gaal son of Ebed, he was furious.<a name="fnB575" href="jdg_note.htm#fn575"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 31>31  He sent messengers to Abimelech, who was in Arumah,<a name="fnB576" href="jdg_note.htm#fn576"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> reporting, "Beware!<a name="fnB577" href="jdg_note.htm#fn577"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a> Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers are coming<a name="fnB578" href="jdg_note.htm#fn578"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> to Shechem and inciting the city to rebel against you.<a name="fnB579" href="jdg_note.htm#fn579"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 32>32  Now, come up<a name="fnB580" href="jdg_note.htm#fn580"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>69</SUP></FONT></a> at night with your men<a name="fnB581" href="jdg_note.htm#fn581"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>70</SUP></FONT></a> and set an ambush in the field outside the city.<a name="fnB582" href="jdg_note.htm#fn582"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>71</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 33>33  In the morning at sunrise quickly attack the city. When he and his men come out to fight you, do what you can to him."<a name="fnB583" href="jdg_note.htm#fn583"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>72</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 34>34  So Abimelech and all his men came up<a name="fnB584" href="jdg_note.htm#fn584"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>73</SUP></FONT></a> at night and set an ambush outside Shechem--they divided into<a name="fnB585" href="jdg_note.htm#fn585"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>74</SUP></FONT></a> four units. 
<bqverse 35>35  When Gaal son of Ebed came out and stood at the entrance to the city's gate, Abimelech and his men got up from their hiding places. 
<bqverse 36>36  Gaal saw the men<a name="fnB586" href="jdg_note.htm#fn586"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>75</SUP></FONT></a> and said to Zebul, "Look, men are coming down from the tops of the hills." But Zebul said to him, "You are seeing the shadows on the hills--it just looks like men."<a name="fnB587" href="jdg_note.htm#fn587"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>76</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 37>37  Gaal again said, "Look, men are coming down from the very center<a name="fnB588" href="jdg_note.htm#fn588"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>77</SUP></FONT></a> of the land. A unit<a name="fnB589" href="jdg_note.htm#fn589"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>78</SUP></FONT></a> is coming by way of the Oak Tree of the Diviners.<a name="fnB590" href="jdg_note.htm#fn590"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>79</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 38>38  Zebul said to him, "Where now are your bragging words,<a name="fnB591" href="jdg_note.htm#fn591"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>80</SUP></FONT></a> `Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?' Are these not the men<a name="fnB592" href="jdg_note.htm#fn592"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>81</SUP></FONT></a> you insulted?<a name="fnB593" href="jdg_note.htm#fn593"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>82</SUP></FONT></a> Go out now and fight them!" 
<bqverse 39>39  So Gaal led the leaders of Shechem out<a name="fnB594" href="jdg_note.htm#fn594"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>83</SUP></FONT></a> and fought Abimelech. 
<bqverse 40>40  Abimelech chased him, and Gaal<a name="fnB595" href="jdg_note.htm#fn595"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>84</SUP></FONT></a> ran from him. Many Shechemites<a name="fnB596" href="jdg_note.htm#fn596"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>85</SUP></FONT></a> fell wounded at the opening of the gate. 
<bqverse 41>41  Abimelech went back<a name="fnB597" href="jdg_note.htm#fn597"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>86</SUP></FONT></a> to Arumah; Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem.<a name="fnB598" href="jdg_note.htm#fn598"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>87</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 42>42  The next day the Shechemites<a name="fnB599" href="jdg_note.htm#fn599"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>88</SUP></FONT></a> came out to the field. When Abimelech heard about it,<a name="fnB600" href="jdg_note.htm#fn600"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>89</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 43>43  he took his men<a name="fnB601" href="jdg_note.htm#fn601"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>90</SUP></FONT></a> and divided them into three units and set an ambush in the field. When he saw the people coming out of the city,<a name="fnB602" href="jdg_note.htm#fn602"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>91</SUP></FONT></a> he attacked and struck them down.<a name="fnB603" href="jdg_note.htm#fn603"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>92</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 44>44  Abimelech and his units<a name="fnB604" href="jdg_note.htm#fn604"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>93</SUP></FONT></a> attacked and blocked<a name="fnB605" href="jdg_note.htm#fn605"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>94</SUP></FONT></a> the entrance to the city's gate. Two units then attacked all the people in the field and struck them down. 
<bqverse 45>45  Abimelech fought against the city all that day. He captured the city and killed all the people in it. Then he leveled<a name="fnB606" href="jdg_note.htm#fn606"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>95</SUP></FONT></a> the city and spread salt over it.<a name="fnB607" href="jdg_note.htm#fn607"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>96</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 46>46  When all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem<a name="fnB608" href="jdg_note.htm#fn608"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>97</SUP></FONT></a> heard the news, they went to the stronghold<a name="fnB609" href="jdg_note.htm#fn609"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>98</SUP></FONT></a> of the temple of El-Berith.<a name="fnB610" href="jdg_note.htm#fn610"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>99</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 47>47  Abimelech heard<a name="fnB611" href="jdg_note.htm#fn611"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>100</SUP></FONT></a> that all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem were in one place.<a name="fnB612" href="jdg_note.htm#fn612"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>101</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 48>48  He and all his men<a name="fnB613" href="jdg_note.htm#fn613"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>102</SUP></FONT></a> went up on Mount Zalmon. He<a name="fnB614" href="jdg_note.htm#fn614"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>103</SUP></FONT></a> took an ax<a name="fnB615" href="jdg_note.htm#fn615"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>104</SUP></FONT></a> in his hand and cut off a tree branch. He put it<a name="fnB616" href="jdg_note.htm#fn616"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>105</SUP></FONT></a> on his shoulder and said to his men, "Quickly, do what you have just seen me do!"<a name="fnB617" href="jdg_note.htm#fn617"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>106</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 49>49  So each of his men also cut off a branch and followed Abimelech. They put the branches<a name="fnB618" href="jdg_note.htm#fn618"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>107</SUP></FONT></a> against the stronghold and set fire to it.<a name="fnB619" href="jdg_note.htm#fn619"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>108</SUP></FONT></a> All the people<a name="fnB620" href="jdg_note.htm#fn620"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>109</SUP></FONT></a> of the Tower of Shechem died--about a thousand men and women.<p>

<bqverse 50>50  Abimelech moved on<a name="fnB621" href="jdg_note.htm#fn621"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>110</SUP></FONT></a> to Thebez; he besieged and captured it.<a name="fnB622" href="jdg_note.htm#fn622"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>111</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 51>51  There was a fortified<a name="fnB623" href="jdg_note.htm#fn623"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>112</SUP></FONT></a> tower<a name="fnB624" href="jdg_note.htm#fn624"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>113</SUP></FONT></a> in the center of the city, so all the men and women, as well as the city's leaders, ran into it and locked the entrance. Then they went up to the roof of the tower. 
<bqverse 52>52  Abimelech came and attacked the tower. When he approached the entrance of the tower to set it on fire, 
<bqverse 53>53  a woman threw an upper millstone<a name="fnB625" href="jdg_note.htm#fn625"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>114</SUP></FONT></a> down on his<a name="fnB626" href="jdg_note.htm#fn626"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>115</SUP></FONT></a> head and shattered his skull. 
<bqverse 54>54  He quickly called to the young man who carried his weapons,<a name="fnB627" href="jdg_note.htm#fn627"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>116</SUP></FONT></a> "Draw your sword and kill me, so they will not say,<a name="fnB628" href="jdg_note.htm#fn628"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>117</SUP></FONT></a> `A woman killed him.' So the young man stabbed him and he died. 
<bqverse 55>55  When the Israelites saw that Abimelech was dead, they went home.<a name="fnB629" href="jdg_note.htm#fn629"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>118</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 56>56  God repaid Abimelech for the evil he did to his father by murdering his seventy half-brothers.<a name="fnB630" href="jdg_note.htm#fn630"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>119</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 57>57  God also repaid the men of Shechem for their evil deeds. The curse spoken by Jotham son of Jerub-Baal fell<a name="fnB631" href="jdg_note.htm#fn631"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>120</SUP></FONT></a> on them.

<bqverse 13>13  The Ammonite king said to Jephthah's messengers, "Because Israel stole<a name="fnB685" href="jdg_note.htm#fn685"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> my land when they<a name="fnB686" href="jdg_note.htm#fn686"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> came up from Egypt--from the Arnon River in the south to the Jabbok River in the north, and as far west as the Jordan.<a name="fnB687" href="jdg_note.htm#fn687"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> Now return it<a name="fnB688" href="jdg_note.htm#fn688"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> peaceably!" <p>

<bqverse 14>14  Jephthah sent messengers back to the Ammonite king 
<bqverse 15>15  and said to him, "This is what Jephthah says, `Israel did not steal<a name="fnB689" href="jdg_note.htm#fn689"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> the land of Moab and the land of the Ammonites. 
<bqverse 16>16  When they left<a name="fnB690" href="jdg_note.htm#fn690"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> Egypt, Israel traveled<a name="fnB691" href="jdg_note.htm#fn691"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> through the desert as far as the Red Sea and then came to Kadesh. 
<bqverse 17>17  Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, "Please allow us<a name="fnB692" href="jdg_note.htm#fn692"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> to pass through your land." But the king of Edom rejected the request.<a name="fnB693" href="jdg_note.htm#fn693"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> Israel sent the same request to the king of Moab, but he was unwilling to cooperate.<a name="fnB694" href="jdg_note.htm#fn694"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> So Israel stayed at Kadesh. 
<bqverse 18>18  Then Israel<a name="fnB695" href="jdg_note.htm#fn695"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> went through the desert and bypassed the land of Edom and the land of Moab.

<bqverse 19>19  Israel sent messengers to King Sihon, the Amorite king who ruled in Heshbon, and said to him, "Please allow us to pass through your land to our land."<a name="fnB697" href="jdg_note.htm#fn697"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory.

<bqverse 21>21  The LORD God of Israel handed Sihon and his whole army over to Israel and they defeated them. Israel took<a name="fnB700" href="jdg_note.htm#fn700"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> all the land of the Amorites who lived in that land. 
<bqverse 22>22  They took all the Amorite territory from the Arnon River on the south to the Jabbok River on the north, from the desert in the east to the Jordan in the west.<a name="fnB701" href="jdg_note.htm#fn701"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 24>24  You have the right to take what Chemosh your god gives you, but we will take the land of all whom the LORD our God has driven out before us.<a name="fnB705" href="jdg_note.htm#fn705"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 26>26  Israel has been living in Heshbon and its nearby towns, in Aroer and its nearby towns, and in all the cities along the Arnon for three hundred years! Why did you not reclaim them during that time? 
<bqverse 27>27  I have not done you wrong,<a name="fnB707" href="jdg_note.htm#fn707"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> but you are doing wrong<a name="fnB708" href="jdg_note.htm#fn708"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> by attacking me.

<bqverse 28>28  But the Ammonite king disregarded<a name="fnB709" href="jdg_note.htm#fn709"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> the message sent by Jephthah.<a name="fnB710" href="jdg_note.htm#fn710"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc494011844"></a></p>

<bqverse 30>30  Jephthah made a vow to the LORD, saying, "If you really do hand the Ammonites over to me,

<bqverse 15>15  Manoah said to the LORD's messenger, "Please stay here awhile,<a name="fnB801" href="jdg_note.htm#fn801"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> so we can prepare a young goat for you to eat."<a name="fnB802" href="jdg_note.htm#fn802"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  The LORD's messenger said to Manoah, "If I stay,<a name="fnB803" href="jdg_note.htm#fn803"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> I will not eat your food. But if you want to make a burnt sacrifice to the LORD, you should offer it."

<bqverse 17>17  Manoah said to the LORD's messenger, "Tell us your name, so we can honor you when your announcement comes true."<a name="fnB805" href="jdg_note.htm#fn805"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a>
<bqverse 18>18  The LORD's messenger said to him, "You should not ask me my name, because you cannot comprehend it."<a name="fnB806" href="jdg_note.htm#fn806"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering and offered them on a rock to the LORD. The LORD's messenger did an amazing thing as Manoah and his wife watched.<a name="fnB807" href="jdg_note.htm#fn807"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  As the flame went up from the altar toward the sky, the LORD's messenger went up in it<a name="fnB808" href="jdg_note.htm#fn808"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> while Manoah and his wife watched.

<bqverse 21>21  The LORD's messenger did not appear again to Manoah and his wife. After all this happened Manoah realized that the visitor had been the LORD's messenger.<a name="fnB810" href="jdg_note.htm#fn810"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  Manoah said to his wife, "We will certainly die, because we have seen a supernatural being!"<a name="fnB811" href="jdg_note.htm#fn811"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23  But his wife said to him, "If the LORD wanted to kill us, he would not have accepted the burnt offering and the grain offering from us.<a name="fnB812" href="jdg_note.htm#fn812"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> He would not have shown us all these things, or just now have spoken to us like this."<p>

<bqverse 24>24  Manoah's wife<a name="fnB813" href="jdg_note.htm#fn813"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> gave birth to a son and named him Samson.<a name="fnB814" href="jdg_note.htm#fn814"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> The child grew and the LORD empowered<a name="fnB815" href="jdg_note.htm#fn815"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> him. 
<bqverse 25>25  The LORD's personal spirit began to control him<a name="fnB816" href="jdg_note.htm#fn816"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> in Mahaneh Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.

<p><i>Samson's Unconsummated Marriage</i>
<p><A NAME="14"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Samson went down to Timnah, where a Philistine girl caught his eye.<a name="fnB817" href="jdg_note.htm#fn817"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  When he got home,<a name="fnB818" href="jdg_note.htm#fn818"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> he told his father and mother, "A Philistine girl in Timnah has caught my eye.<a name="fnB819" href="jdg_note.htm#fn819"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> Now get her for my wife." 
<bqverse 3>3  But his father and mother said to him, "Certainly you can find a wife among your relatives or among all our<a name="fnB820" href="jdg_note.htm#fn820"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> people! You should not have to go and get a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines."<a name="fnB821" href="jdg_note.htm#fn821"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> But Samson said to his father, "Get her for me,<a name="fnB822" href="jdg_note.htm#fn822"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> because she is the right one for me."<a name="fnB823" href="jdg_note.htm#fn823"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  Now his father and mother did not realize this was the LORD's doing.<a name="fnB824" href="jdg_note.htm#fn824"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> He was looking for an opportunity to stir up trouble with the Philistines,<a name="fnB825" href="jdg_note.htm#fn825"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> for at that time the Philistines were ruling Israel.<p>

<bqverse 5>5  Samson went down to Timnah. When he approached<a name="fnB826" href="jdg_note.htm#fn826"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> the vineyards of Timnah, he saw a roaring young lion attacking him.<a name="fnB827" href="jdg_note.htm#fn827"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  The LORD's personal spirit empowered<a name="fnB828" href="jdg_note.htm#fn828"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> him and he tore the lion<a name="fnB829" href="jdg_note.htm#fn829"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> in two with his bare hands<a name="fnB830" href="jdg_note.htm#fn830"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> as easily as one would tear a young goat. But he did not tell his father or mother what he had done.<p>

<bqverse 7>7  Samson continued on down to Timnah<a name="fnB831" href="jdg_note.htm#fn831"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> and spoke to the girl. In his opinion, she was just the right one.<a name="fnB832" href="jdg_note.htm#fn832"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  Some time later, when he went back to marry<a name="fnB833" href="jdg_note.htm#fn833"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> her, he turned aside to see the lion's remains. He saw<a name="fnB834" href="jdg_note.htm#fn834"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> a swarm of bees in the lion's carcass, as well as some honey. 
<bqverse 9>9 He scooped it up with his hands and ate it as he walked along. When he returned<a name="fnB835" href="jdg_note.htm#fn835"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> to his father and mother, he offered them some and they ate it. But he did not tell them he had scooped the honey out of the lion's carcass.<a name="fnB836" href="jdg_note.htm#fn836"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 10>10  Then Samson's father accompanied him to Timnah for the marriage.<a name="fnB837" href="jdg_note.htm#fn837"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> Samson hosted a party<a name="fnB838" href="jdg_note.htm#fn838"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> there, for this was customary for bridegrooms<a name="fnB839" href="jdg_note.htm#fn839"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> to do. 
<bqverse 11>11  When the Philistines saw he had no attendants, they gave him thirty groomsmen who kept him company.<a name="fnB840" href="jdg_note.htm#fn840"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  Samson said to them, "I will give you a riddle. If you really can solve it during the seven days the party lasts,<a name="fnB841" href="jdg_note.htm#fn841"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> I will give you thirty linen robes and thirty sets<a name="fnB842" href="jdg_note.htm#fn842"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> of clothes. 
<bqverse 13>13  But if you cannot solve it,<a name="fnB843" href="jdg_note.htm#fn843"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> you will give me thirty linen robes and thirty sets of clothes." They said to him, "Let us hear your riddle."<a name="fnB844" href="jdg_note.htm#fn844"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  He said to them,</p>
<br>"Out of the one who eats came something to eat;<br>
out of the strong one came something sweet."</ul><p>They could not solve the riddle for three days. </p>
<p>
<bqverse 15>15  On the fourth<a name="fnB845" href="jdg_note.htm#fn845"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> day they said to Samson's bride, "Trick your husband into giving the solution to the riddle.<a name="fnB846" href="jdg_note.htm#fn846"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> If you refuse,<a name="fnB847" href="jdg_note.htm#fn847"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> we will burn up<a name="fnB848" href="jdg_note.htm#fn848"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> you and your father's family.<a name="fnB849" href="jdg_note.htm#fn849"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> Did you invite us here<a name="fnB850" href="jdg_note.htm#fn850"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> to make us poor?"<a name="fnB851" href="jdg_note.htm#fn851"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  So Samson's bride cried on his shoulder<a name="fnB852" href="jdg_note.htm#fn852"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> and said, "You must<a name="fnB853" href="jdg_note.htm#fn853"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> hate me; you do not love me! You told the young men<a name="fnB854" href="jdg_note.htm#fn854"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> a riddle, but you have not told me the solution." He said to her, "Look, I have not even told my father or mother. Do you really expect me to tell you?"<a name="fnB855" href="jdg_note.htm#fn855"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  She cried on his shoulder<a name="fnB856" href="jdg_note.htm#fn856"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> until the party was almost over.<a name="fnB857" href="jdg_note.htm#fn857"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> Finally, on the seventh day, he told her because she had nagged him so much.<a name="fnB858" href="jdg_note.htm#fn858"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> Then she told the young men the solution to the riddle.<a name="fnB859" href="jdg_note.htm#fn859"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  On the seventh day, before the sun set, the men of the city said to him,</p>
<br>"What is sweeter than honey?<br>
What is stronger than a lion?"</ul><p>He said to them,</p>
<br>"If you had not plowed with my heifer,<a name="fnB860" href="jdg_note.htm#fn860"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a><br>
you would not have solved my riddle!" </ul><p>
<bqverse 19>19  The LORD's personal spirit empowered him. He went down to Ashkelon and murdered thirty men. He took their clothes<a name="fnB861" href="jdg_note.htm#fn861"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> and gave them<a name="fnB862" href="jdg_note.htm#fn862"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> to the men who had solved the riddle. He was furious as he went back home.<a name="fnB863" href="jdg_note.htm#fn863"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  Samson's bride was then given to his best man.<a name="fnB864" href="jdg_note.htm#fn864"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Samson Versus the Philistines</i>
<p><A NAME="15"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Sometime later, during the wheat harvest,<a name="fnB865" href="jdg_note.htm#fn865"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> Samson took a young goat as a gift and went to visit his bride.<a name="fnB866" href="jdg_note.htm#fn866"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> He said to her father,<a name="fnB867" href="jdg_note.htm#fn867"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> "I want to have sex with my bride in her bedroom!"<a name="fnB868" href="jdg_note.htm#fn868"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> But her father would not let him enter. 
<bqverse 2>2  Her father said, "I really thought<a name="fnB869" href="jdg_note.htm#fn869"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> you absolutely despised<a name="fnB870" href="jdg_note.htm#fn870"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> her, so I gave her to your best man. Her younger sister is more attractive than she is. Take her instead!"<a name="fnB871" href="jdg_note.htm#fn871"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  Samson said to them,<a name="fnB872" href="jdg_note.htm#fn872"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> "This time I am justified in doing the Philistines harm!"<a name="fnB873" href="jdg_note.htm#fn873"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  Samson went and captured three hundred jackals<a name="fnB874" href="jdg_note.htm#fn874"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and got some torches. He tied the jackals in pairs by their tails and then tied a torch to each pair.<a name="fnB875" href="jdg_note.htm#fn875"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  He lit the torches<a name="fnB876" href="jdg_note.htm#fn876"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> and set the jackals loose in the Philistines' standing grain. He burned up the grain heaps and the standing grain, as well as the vineyards and olive groves. 
<bqverse 6>6  The Philistines asked,<a name="fnB877" href="jdg_note.htm#fn877"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> "Who did this?" They were told,<a name="fnB878" href="jdg_note.htm#fn878"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> "Samson, the Timnite's son-in-law, because the Timnite<a name="fnB879" href="jdg_note.htm#fn879"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> took Samson's<a name="fnB880" href="jdg_note.htm#fn880"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> bride and gave her to his best man." So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father.<a name="fnB881" href="jdg_note.htm#fn881"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  Samson said to them, "Because you did this,<a name="fnB882" href="jdg_note.htm#fn882"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> I will get revenge against you before I quit fighting."<a name="fnB883" href="jdg_note.htm#fn883"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  He struck them down and defeated them.<a name="fnB884" href="jdg_note.htm#fn884"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> Then he went down and lived for a time in the cave in the cliff of Etam.<p>

<bqverse 9>9  The Philistines went up and invaded<a name="fnB885" href="jdg_note.htm#fn885"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> Judah. They arrayed themselves for battle<a name="fnB886" href="jdg_note.htm#fn886"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> in Lehi. 
<bqverse 10>10  The men of Judah said, "Why are you attacking<a name="fnB887" href="jdg_note.htm#fn887"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> us?" The Philistines<a name="fnB888" href="jdg_note.htm#fn888"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> said, "We have come up to take Samson prisoner so we can do to him what he has done to us." 
<bqverse 11>11  Three thousand men of Judah went down to the cave in the cliff of Etam and said to Samson, "Do you not know that the Philistines rule over us? Why have you done this to us?" He said to them, "I have only done to them what they have done to me." 
<bqverse 12>12  They said to him, "We have come down to take you prisoner so we can hand you over to the Philistines." Samson said to them, "Promise me<a name="fnB889" href="jdg_note.htm#fn889"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> you will not kill<a name="fnB890" href="jdg_note.htm#fn890"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> me." 
<bqverse 13>13  They said to him, "We promise!<a name="fnB891" href="jdg_note.htm#fn891"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> We will only take you prisoner and hand you over to them. We promise not to kill you." They tied him up with two brand new ropes and led him up from the cliff. 
<bqverse 14>14  When he arrived in Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they approached him. But the LORD's personal spirit empowered<a name="fnB892" href="jdg_note.htm#fn892"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> him. The ropes around his arms were like flax dissolving in<a name="fnB893" href="jdg_note.htm#fn893"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> fire, and they<a name="fnB894" href="jdg_note.htm#fn894"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> melted away from his hands. 
<bqverse 15>15  He happened to see<a name="fnB895" href="jdg_note.htm#fn895"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> a solid<a name="fnB896" href="jdg_note.htm#fn896"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> jawbone of a donkey. He grabbed it<a name="fnB897" href="jdg_note.htm#fn897"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> and struck down<a name="fnB898" href="jdg_note.htm#fn898"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> a thousand men. 
<bqverse 16>16  Samson then said,</p>
<br>"With the jawbone of a donkey <br>
I have left them in heaps;<a name="fnB899" href="jdg_note.htm#fn899"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a><br>
with the jawbone of a donkey <br>
I have struck down a thousand men!"</ul><p>
<bqverse 17>17  When he finished speaking, he threw the jawbone down<a name="fnB900" href="jdg_note.htm#fn900"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> and named that place Ramath Lehi.<a name="fnB901" href="jdg_note.htm#fn901"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 18>18  He was very thirsty, so he cried out to the LORD and said, "You have given your servant<a name="fnB902" href="jdg_note.htm#fn902"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> this great victory. But now must I die of thirst and fall into hands of the Philistines?"<a name="fnB903" href="jdg_note.htm#fn903"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  So God split open the basin<a name="fnB904" href="jdg_note.htm#fn904"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> at Lehi and water flowed out from it. When he took a drink, his strength<a name="fnB905" href="jdg_note.htm#fn905"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> was restored and he revived. For this reason he named the spring<a name="fnB906" href="jdg_note.htm#fn906"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> En Hakkore.<a name="fnB907" href="jdg_note.htm#fn907"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> It remains in Lehi to this very day. 
<bqverse 20>20  Samson led<a name="fnB908" href="jdg_note.htm#fn908"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> Israel for twenty years during the days of Philistine prominence.<a name="fnB909" href="jdg_note.htm#fn909"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a>

So they surrounded the town<a name="fnB912" href="jdg_note.htm#fn912"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> and hid all night at the city gate, waiting for him to leave.<a name="fnB913" href="jdg_note.htm#fn913"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> They relaxed<a name="fnB914" href="jdg_note.htm#fn914"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> all night, thinking,<a name="fnB915" href="jdg_note.htm#fn915"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> "He will not leave<a name="fnB916" href="jdg_note.htm#fn916"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> until morning comes;<a name="fnB917" href="jdg_note.htm#fn917"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> then we will kill him!" 
<bqverse 3>3  Samson spent half the night with the prostitute; then he got up in the middle of the night and left.<a name="fnB918" href="jdg_note.htm#fn918"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> He grabbed the doors of the city gate, as well as the two posts, and pulled them right off, bar and all.<a name="fnB919" href="jdg_note.htm#fn919"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> He put them on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of a hill east of Hebron.<a name="fnB920" href="jdg_note.htm#fn920"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 4>4  After this Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah, who lived in the Sorek Valley. 
<bqverse 5>5  The rulers of the Philistines went up to visit her and said to her, "Trick him! Find out what makes him so strong and how we can subdue him and humiliate<a name="fnB921" href="jdg_note.htm#fn921"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> him. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred silver pieces."<p>

<bqverse 6>6  So Delilah said to Samson, "Tell me what makes you so strong and how you can be subdued and humiliated."<a name="fnB922" href="jdg_note.htm#fn922"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  Samson said to her, "If they tie me up with seven fresh<a name="fnB923" href="jdg_note.htm#fn923"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> bowstrings<a name="fnB924" href="jdg_note.htm#fn924"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> that have not been dried, I will become weak and be just like any other man." 
<bqverse 8>8  So the rulers of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings which had not been dried and they tied him up with them. 
<bqverse 9>9  They hid<a name="fnB925" href="jdg_note.htm#fn925"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> in the bedroom and then she said to him, "The Philistines are here,<a name="fnB926" href="jdg_note.htm#fn926"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> Samson!" He snapped the bowstrings as easily as a thread of yarn snaps when it is put close to fire.<a name="fnB927" href="jdg_note.htm#fn927"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> The secret of his strength was not discovered.<a name="fnB928" href="jdg_note.htm#fn928"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 10>10  Delilah said to Samson, "Look, you deceived<a name="fnB929" href="jdg_note.htm#fn929"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> me and told me lies. Now tell me how you can be subdued." 
<bqverse 11>11  He said to her, "If they tie me tightly with brand new ropes that have never been used,<a name="fnB930" href="jdg_note.htm#fn930"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> I will become weak and be just like any other man." 
<bqverse 12>12  So Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them and said to him, "The Philistines are here,<a name="fnB931" href="jdg_note.htm#fn931"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> Samson!" (The Philistines were hiding in the bedroom.)<a name="fnB932" href="jdg_note.htm#fn932"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> But he tore the ropes<a name="fnB933" href="jdg_note.htm#fn933"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> from his arms as if they were a piece of thread.<p>

<bqverse 13>13  Delilah said to Samson, "Up to now you have deceived me and told me lies. Tell me how you can be subdued." He said to her, "If you weave the seven braids of my hair<a name="fnB934" href="jdg_note.htm#fn934"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> into the fabric on the loom<a name="fnB935" href="jdg_note.htm#fn935"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> and secure it with the pin, I will become weak and be like any other man." 
<bqverse 14>14  So she made him go to sleep, wove the seven braids of his hair into the fabric on the loom, fastened it with the pin, and said to him, "The Philistines are here,<a name="fnB936" href="jdg_note.htm#fn936"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> Samson!"<a name="fnB937" href="jdg_note.htm#fn937"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> He woke up<a name="fnB938" href="jdg_note.htm#fn938"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> and tore away the pin of the loom and the fabric.<p>

<bqverse 15>15  She said to him, "How can you say, `I love you,' when you will not share your secret with me?<a name="fnB939" href="jdg_note.htm#fn939"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> Three times you have deceived me and have not told me what makes you so strong." 
<bqverse 16>16  She nagged him<a name="fnB940" href="jdg_note.htm#fn940"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> every day and pressured him until he was sick to death of it.<a name="fnB941" href="jdg_note.htm#fn941"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  Finally he told her his secret.<a name="fnB942" href="jdg_note.htm#fn942"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> He said to her, "My hair has never been cut,<a name="fnB943" href="jdg_note.htm#fn943"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> for I have been dedicated to God<a name="fnB944" href="jdg_note.htm#fn944"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> from the time I was conceived.<a name="fnB945" href="jdg_note.htm#fn945"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> If my head<a name="fnB946" href="jdg_note.htm#fn946"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> were shaved, my strength would leave me; I would become weak, and be just like all other men." 
<bqverse 18>18  When Delilah saw that he had told her his secret,<a name="fnB947" href="jdg_note.htm#fn947"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> she sent for<a name="fnB948" href="jdg_note.htm#fn948"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> the rulers of the Philistines, saying, "Come up here again, for he has told me<a name="fnB949" href="jdg_note.htm#fn949"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> his secret.<a name="fnB950" href="jdg_note.htm#fn950"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> So the rulers of the Philistines went up to visit her, bringing the silver in their hands. 
<bqverse 19>19  She made him go to sleep on her lap<a name="fnB951" href="jdg_note.htm#fn951"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> and then called a man in to shave off<a name="fnB952" href="jdg_note.htm#fn952"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> the seven braids of his hair.<a name="fnB953" href="jdg_note.htm#fn953"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> She made him vulnerable<a name="fnB954" href="jdg_note.htm#fn954"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> and his strength left him. 
<bqverse 20>20  She said, "The Philistines are here,<a name="fnB955" href="jdg_note.htm#fn955"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> Samson!" He woke up<a name="fnB956" href="jdg_note.htm#fn956"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> and thought,<a name="fnB957" href="jdg_note.htm#fn957"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> "I will do as I did before<a name="fnB958" href="jdg_note.htm#fn958"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> and shake myself free." But he did not realize that the LORD had left him. 
<bqverse 21>21  The Philistines captured him and gouged out his eyes. They brought him down to Gaza and bound him in bronze chains. He became a grinder in the prison. 
<bqverse 22>22  His hair<a name="fnB959" href="jdg_note.htm#fn959"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> began to grow back after it had been shaved off.<a name="_Toc494011851"></a></p>
<p><i>Samson's Death and Burial</i>
<p>
<bqverse 23>23  The rulers of the Philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate. They said, "Our god has handed Samson, our enemy, over to us." 
<bqverse 24>24  When the people saw him,<a name="fnB960" href="jdg_note.htm#fn960"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> they praised their god, saying, "Our god has handed our enemy over to us, the one who ruined our land and killed so many of us!"<a name="fnB961" href="jdg_note.htm#fn961"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 25>25  When they really started celebrating,<a name="fnB962" href="jdg_note.htm#fn962"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> they said, "Call for Samson so he can entertain us!" So they summoned Samson from the prison and he entertained them.<a name="fnB963" href="jdg_note.htm#fn963"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> They made him stand between two pillars. 
<bqverse 26>26  Samson said to the young man who held his hand, "Position me so I can touch the pillars that support the temple.<a name="fnB964" href="jdg_note.htm#fn964"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> Then I can lean on them." 
<bqverse 27>27  Now the temple<a name="fnB965" href="jdg_note.htm#fn965"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> was filled with men and women, and all the rulers of the Philistines were there. There were three thousand men and women on the roof watching Samson entertain. 
<bqverse 28>28  Samson called to the LORD, "O Master, LORD,<a name="fnB966" href="jdg_note.htm#fn966"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> remember me! Strengthen me just one more time, O God, so I can get swift revenge<a name="fnB967" href="jdg_note.htm#fn967"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> against the Philistines for my two eyes!" 
<bqverse 29>29  Samson took hold of the two middle pillars that supported the temple<a name="fnB968" href="jdg_note.htm#fn968"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> and he leaned against them, with his right hand on one and his left hand on the other. 
<bqverse 30>30  Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines!" He pushed hard<a name="fnB969" href="jdg_note.htm#fn969"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> and the temple collapsed on the rulers and all the people in it. He killed many more people in his death than he had killed during his life.<a name="fnB970" href="jdg_note.htm#fn970"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 31>31  His brothers and all his family<a name="fnB971" href="jdg_note.htm#fn971"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> went down and brought him back.<a name="fnB972" href="jdg_note.htm#fn972"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> They buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had led<a name="fnB973" href="jdg_note.htm#fn973"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> Israel for twenty years.

<bqverse 3>3  When he gave back to his mother the eleven hundred pieces of silver, his mother said, "I solemnly dedicate<a name="fnB979" href="jdg_note.htm#fn979"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> this silver to the LORD.

<p><i>Micah Hires a Professional</i>

<bqverse 7>7  There was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah. He was a Levite who had been temporarily residing among the tribe of Judah.<a name="fnB988" href="jdg_note.htm#fn988"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  This man left the town of Bethlehem in Judah to find another place to live. He came to the Ephraimite hill country and made his way to Micah's house.<a name="fnB989" href="jdg_note.htm#fn989"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a>

<bqverse 2>2  The Danites sent out from their whole tribe five representatives,<a name="fnB998" href="jdg_note.htm#fn998"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> capable men<a name="fnB999" href="jdg_note.htm#fn999"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and explore it.

<bqverse 11>11  So six hundred Danites, fully armed, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol.<a name="fnB1027" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1027"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  They went up and camped in Kiriath Jearim in Judah. (To this day that place is called Camp of Dan.<a name="fnB1028" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1028"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> It is west<a name="fnB1029" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1029"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> of Kiriath Jearim.) 
<bqverse 13>13  From there they traveled through the Ephraimite hill country and arrived at Micah's house. 
<bqverse 14>14  The five men who had gone to spy out the land of Laish<a name="fnB1030" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1030"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> said to their kinsmen,<a name="fnB1031" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1031"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> "Do you realize that inside these houses are an ephod, some personal idols, a carved image, and a metal image? Decide now what you want to do." 
<bqverse 15>15  They stopped<a name="fnB1032" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1032"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> there, went inside the young Levite's house (which belonged to Micah),<a name="fnB1033" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1033"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> and asked him how he was doing.<a name="fnB1034" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1034"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  Meanwhile the six hundred Danites, fully armed, stood at the entrance to the gate.<a name="fnB1035" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1035"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  The five men who had gone to spy out the land broke in and stole<a name="fnB1036" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1036"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> the carved image, the ephod, the personal idols, and the metal image, while the priest was standing at the entrance to the gate with the six hundred fully armed men.<a name="fnB1037" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1037"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  When these men broke into Micah's house and stole<a name="fnB1038" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1038"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> the carved image, the ephod, the personal idols, and the metal image, the priest said to them, "What are you doing?" 
<bqverse 19>19  They said to him, "Shut up! Put your hand over your mouth and come with us! You can be our adviser<a name="fnB1039" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1039"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> and priest. Wouldn't it be better to be a priest for a whole Israelite tribe than for just one man's family?"<a name="fnB1040" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1040"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 20>20  The priest was happy. He took the ephod, the personal idols, and the carved image and joined the group.<a name="fnB1041" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1041"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 21>21  They turned and went on their way, but they walked behind the children, the cattle, and their possessions.<a name="fnB1042" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1042"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 22>22  After they had gone a good distance from Micah's house, Micah's neighbors<a name="fnB1043" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1043"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> gathered together and caught up with the Danites. 
<bqverse 23>23  When they called out to the Danites, the Danites<a name="fnB1044" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1044"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> turned around and said to Micah, "Why have you gathered together?" 
<bqverse 24>24  He said, "You stole my gods that I made, as well as this priest, and then went away. What do I have left? How can you have the audacity to say to me, `What do you want?'"<a name="fnB1045" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1045"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  The Danites said to him, "Don't say another word to us, or some very angry men<a name="fnB1046" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1046"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> will attack you, and you and your family will die."<a name="fnB1047" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1047"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  The Danites went on their way; when Micah realized<a name="fnB1048" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1048"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> they were too strong to resist,<a name="fnB1049" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1049"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> he turned around and went home.<p>

<bqverse 27>27  Now the Danites<a name="fnB1050" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1050"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> took what Micah had made, as well as his priest, and came to Laish, where the people were undisturbed and unsuspecting. They struck them down with the sword and burned the city.<a name="fnB1051" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1051"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 28>28  No one came to the rescue because the city<a name="fnB1052" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1052"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> was far from Sidon and they had no dealings with anyone.<a name="fnB1053" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1053"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> The city<a name="fnB1054" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1054"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> was in a valley near Beth Rehob. The Danites<a name="fnB1055" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1055"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> rebuilt the city and occupied it. 
<bqverse 29>29  They named it Dan after their ancestor, who was one of Israel's sons.<a name="fnB1056" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1056"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> But the city's name used to be Laish. 
<bqverse 30>30  The Danites worshiped<a name="fnB1057" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1057"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> the carved image. Jonathan, descendant<a name="fnB1058" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1058"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> of Gershom, son of Moses,<a name="fnB1059" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1059"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> and his descendants<a name="fnB1060" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1060"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> served as priests for the tribe of Dan until the time of the exile. 
<bqverse 31>31 They worshiped<a name="fnB1061" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1061"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a> Micah's carved image<a name="fnB1062" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1062"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> the whole time God's authorized shrine<a name="fnB1063" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1063"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a> was in Shiloh.

<p><i>Sodom and Gomorrah Revisited</i>
<p><A NAME="19"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> In those days Israel had no king. There was a Levite<a name="fnB1064" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1064"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> living temporarily in the remote region of the Ephraimite hill country. He acquired a concubine<a name="fnB1065" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1065"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> from Bethlehem in Judah. 
<bqverse 2>2  However, she<a name="fnB1066" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1066"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> got mad at him<a name="fnB1067" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1067"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> and went home<a name="fnB1068" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1068"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> to her father's house in Bethlehem in Judah. When she had been there four months, 
<bqverse 3>3  her husband came<a name="fnB1069" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1069"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> after her, hoping he could convince her to return.<a name="fnB1070" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1070"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> He brought with him his servant<a name="fnB1071" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1071"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> and a pair of donkeys. When she brought him into her father's house and the girl's father saw him, he warmly greeted him.<a name="fnB1072" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1072"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  His father-in-law, the girl's father, persuaded him to stay with him for three days, and they partied together.<a name="fnB1073" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1073"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  On the fourth day they woke up early and the Levite got ready to leave.<a name="fnB1074" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1074"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> But the girl's father said to his son-in-law, "Have a bite to eat for some energy,<a name="fnB1075" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1075"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> then you can go." 
<bqverse 6>6  So the two of them sat down and had a meal together.<a name="fnB1076" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1076"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> Then the girl's father said to the man, "Why not stay another night and have a good time!"<a name="fnB1077" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1077"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  When the man got ready to leave,<a name="fnB1078" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1078"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> his father-in-law convinced him to stay another night.<a name="fnB1079" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1079"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  He woke up early in the morning on the fifth day so he could leave, but the girl's father said, "Get some energy.<a name="fnB1080" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1080"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> Wait until later in the day to leave!"<a name="fnB1081" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1081"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> So they ate a meal together. 
<bqverse 9>9  When the man got ready to leave<a name="fnB1082" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1082"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> with his concubine and his servant,<a name="fnB1083" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1083"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> his father-in-law, the girl's father, said to him, "Look!

You can get up early tomorrow and start your trip home."<a name="fnB1086" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1086"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  But the man did not want to stay another night. He left<a name="fnB1087" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1087"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> and traveled as far as<a name="fnB1088" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1088"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). He had with him a pair of saddled donkeys and his concubine.<a name="fnB1089" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1089"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 11>11  When they got near Jebus, it was getting quite late<a name="fnB1090" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1090"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> and the servant<a name="fnB1091" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1091"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> said to his master, "Come on, let's stop at<a name="fnB1092" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1092"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> this Jebusite city and spend the night in it." 
<bqverse 12>12  But his master said to him, "We should not stop at a foreign city where non-Israelites live.<a name="fnB1093" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1093"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> We will travel on to Gibeah." 
<bqverse 13>13  He said to his servant,<a name="fnB1094" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1094"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> "Come on, we will go into one of the other towns<a name="fnB1095" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1095"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> and spend the night in Gibeah or Ramah." 
<bqverse 14>14  So they traveled on,<a name="fnB1096" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1096"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> and the sun went down when they were near Gibeah in<a name="fnB1097" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1097"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> Benjamin. 
<bqverse 15>15  They stopped there and decided to spend the night<a name="fnB1098" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1098"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> in Gibeah. They came into the city and sat down in the town square, but no one invited them to spend the night.<a name="fnB1099" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1099"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 16>16  But then an old man passed by, returning at the end of the day from his work in the field.<a name="fnB1100" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1100"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> The man was from the Ephraimite hill country; he was living temporarily in Gibeah. (The residents of the town were Benjaminites.)<a name="fnB1101" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1101"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  When he looked up and saw the traveler<a name="fnB1102" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1102"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> in the town square, the old man said, "Where are you heading? Where do you come from?" 
<bqverse 18>18  The Levite<a name="fnB1103" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1103"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> said to him, "We are traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote region of the Ephraimite hill country. That's where I'm from. I had business in Bethlehem in Judah, but now I'm heading home.<a name="fnB1104" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1104"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> But no one has invited me into their home. 
<bqverse 19>19  We have enough straw and grain for our donkeys, and there is enough food and wine for me, your female servant,<a name="fnB1105" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1105"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> and the young man who is with your servants.<a name="fnB1106" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1106"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> We lack nothing." 
<bqverse 20>20  The old man said, "Everything is just fine!<a name="fnB1107" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> I will take care of all your needs. But don't spend the night in the town square." 
<bqverse 21>21  So he brought him to his house and fed the donkeys. They washed their feet and had a meal.<a name="fnB1108" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1108"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 22>22  They were having a good time,<a name="fnB1109" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1109"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> when suddenly<a name="fnB1110" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> some men of the city, some good-for-nothings,<a name="fnB1111" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> surrounded the house and kept beating<a name="fnB1112" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1112"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> on the door. They said to the old man who owned the house, "Send out the man who came to visit you so we can have sex with him."<a name="fnB1113" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1113"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 23>23  The man who owned the house went outside and said to them, "No, my brothers! Don't do this wicked thing! After all, this man is a guest in my house. Don't do such a disgraceful thing! 
<bqverse 24>24  Here are my virgin daughter and the visitor's<a name="fnB1114" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1114"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> concubine. I will send them out and you can abuse them and do to them whatever you like.<a name="fnB1115" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1115"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> But don't do such a disgraceful thing to this man!" 
<bqverse 25>25  The men refused to listen to him, so the Levite<a name="fnB1116" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1116"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> grabbed his concubine and made her go outside.<a name="fnB1117" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1117"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> They raped<a name="fnB1118" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1118"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> her and abused her all night long until morning. They let her go at dawn. 
<bqverse 26>26  The woman arrived back at daybreak and was sprawled out on the doorstep of the house where her master<a name="fnB1119" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1119"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> was staying until it became light.<a name="fnB1120" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1120"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 27>27  When her master<a name="fnB1121" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1121"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> got up in the morning, opened the doors of the house, and went outside to start on his journey, there was the woman, his concubine, sprawled out on the doorstep of the house with her hands on the threshold. 
<bqverse 28>28  He said to her, "Get up, let's leave!" But there was no response. He put her on the donkey and went home.<a name="fnB1122" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1122"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 29>29  When he got home, he took a knife, grabbed his wife, and carved her up into twelve pieces.<a name="fnB1123" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1123"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> Then he sent them throughout Israel.<a name="fnB1124" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1124"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 30>30  Everyone who saw the sight<a name="fnB1125" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1125"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> said, "Nothing like this has happened or been witnessed during the entire time since<a name="fnB1126" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1126"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> the Israelites left the land of Egypt.<a name="fnB1127" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1127"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> Take careful note of it!

<bqverse 2>2  The leaders<a name="fnB1132" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1132"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> of all the people from all the tribes of Israel took their places in the assembly of God's people, which numbered<a name="fnB1133" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1133"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> four hundred thousand sword-wielding foot soldiers. 
<bqverse 3>3  The Benjaminites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah. Then the Israelites said, "Explain how this wicked thing happened!" 
<bqverse 4>4  The Levite,<a name="fnB1134" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1134"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> the husband of the murdered woman, spoke up, "I and my concubine stopped in<a name="fnB1135" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1135"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> Gibeah of Benjamin to spend the night. 
<bqverse 5>5  The leaders of Gibeah attacked me and at nighttime surrounded the house where I was staying.<a name="fnB1136" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1136"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> They wanted to kill me; instead they abused my concubine so badly that she died. 
<bqverse 6>6  I grabbed hold of my concubine and carved her up and sent the pieces<a name="fnB1137" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1137"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> throughout the territory occupied by Israel,<a name="fnB1138" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1138"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> because they committed such an unthinkable atrocity<a name="fnB1139" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1139"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> in Israel. 
<bqverse 7>7  All you Israelites,<a name="fnB1140" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1140"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> make a decision here!"<a name="fnB1141" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1141"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 8>8  All Israel rose up in unison<a name="fnB1142" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1142"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> and said, "Not one of us will go home!<a name="fnB1143" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1143"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> Not one of us will return<a name="fnB1144" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1144"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> to his house! 
<bqverse 9>9  Now this is what we will do to Gibeah: We will attack the city as the lot dictates.<a name="fnB1145" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1145"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  We will take ten of every group of a hundred men from all the tribes of Israel (and a hundred of every group of a thousand, and a thousand of every group of ten thousand) to get supplies for the army.<a name="fnB1146" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1146"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> When they arrive in Gibeah of Benjamin they will punish them for the atrocity which they committed in Israel.<a name="fnB1147" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1147"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  So all the men of Israel gathered together at the city as allies.<a name="fnB1148" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1148"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 12>12  The tribes of Israel sent men throughout the tribe<a name="fnB1149" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1149"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> of Benjamin, saying, "How could such a wicked thing take place?<a name="fnB1150" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1150"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  Now, hand over the good-for-nothings<a name="fnB1151" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1151"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> in Gibeah so we can execute them and purge Israel of wickedness.<a name="fnB1152" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1152"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> But the Benjaminites refused to listen to their Israelite brothers. 
<bqverse 14>14  The Benjaminites came from their cities and assembled at Gibeah<a name="fnB1153" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1153"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> to make war against the Israelites. 
<bqverse 15>15  That day the Benjaminites mustered from their cities twenty-six thousand sword-wielding soldiers, besides seven hundred well-trained soldiers from Gibeah.<a name="fnB1154" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1154"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  Among this army<a name="fnB1155" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1155"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> were seven hundred specially-trained left-handed soldiers.<a name="fnB1156" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1156"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> Each one could sling a stone and hit even the smallest target.<a name="fnB1157" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1157"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  The men of Israel (not counting Benjamin) had mustered four hundred thousand sword-wielding soldiers, every one an experienced warrior.<a name="fnB1158" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1158"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 18>18  The Israelites went up to Bethel and asked God,<a name="fnB1159" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1159"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> "Who should lead the charge against the Benjaminites?"<a name="fnB1160" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1160"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> The LORD said, "Judah should lead." 
<bqverse 19>19  The Israelites got up the next morning and moved<a name="fnB1161" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1161"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> against Gibeah. 
<bqverse 20>20  The men of Israel marched out to fight Benjamin; they<a name="fnB1162" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1162"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> arranged their battle lines against Gibeah. 
<bqverse 21>21  The Benjaminites attacked from Gibeah and struck down twenty-two thousand Israelites that day.<a name="fnB1163" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1163"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 22>22  The Israelite army<a name="fnB1164" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1164"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> took heart<a name="fnB1165" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1165"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> and once more arranged their battle lines, in the same place where they had taken their positions the day before. 
<bqverse 23>23  The Israelites went up and wept before the LORD until evening. They asked the LORD, "Should we<a name="fnB1166" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1166"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> again march out to fight<a name="fnB1167" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1167"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> the Benjaminites, our brothers?"<a name="fnB1168" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1168"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> The LORD said, "Attack them!"<a name="fnB1169" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1169"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  So the Israelites marched toward<a name="fnB1170" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1170"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a> the Benjaminites the next day. 
<bqverse 25>25  The Benjaminites again attacked them from Gibeah and struck down eighteen thousand sword-wielding Israelite soldiers.<a name="fnB1171" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1171"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>44</SUP></FONT></a> <p>

<bqverse 26>26  So all the Israelites, the whole army,<a name="fnB1172" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1172"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>45</SUP></FONT></a> went up to<a name="fnB1173" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1173"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>46</SUP></FONT></a> Bethel. They wept and sat there before the LORD; they did not eat anything<a name="fnB1174" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1174"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>47</SUP></FONT></a> that day until evening. They offered up burnt sacrifices and tokens of peace<a name="fnB1175" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1175"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>48</SUP></FONT></a> to the LORD. 
<bqverse 27>27  The Israelites asked the LORD (for the ark of God's covenant was there in those days; 
<bqverse 28>28  Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, was serving the LORD<a name="fnB1176" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1176"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>49</SUP></FONT></a> in those days), "Should we<a name="fnB1177" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1177"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>50</SUP></FONT></a> once more march out to fight the Benjaminites our brothers,<a name="fnB1178" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1178"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>51</SUP></FONT></a> or should we<a name="fnB1179" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1179"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>52</SUP></FONT></a> quit?" The LORD said, "Attack, for tomorrow I will hand them<a name="fnB1180" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1180"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>53</SUP></FONT></a> over to you." <p>

<bqverse 29>29  So Israel hid men in ambush outside Gibeah. 
<bqverse 30>30  The Israelites attacked the Benjaminites the next day;<a name="fnB1181" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1181"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>54</SUP></FONT></a> they took their positions against Gibeah just as they had done before. 
<bqverse 31>31  The Benjaminites attacked<a name="fnB1182" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1182"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>55</SUP></FONT></a> the army, leaving the city unguarded.<a name="fnB1183" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1183"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>56</SUP></FONT></a> They began to strike down their enemy<a name="fnB1184" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1184"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>57</SUP></FONT></a> just as they had done before. On the main roads (one leads to Bethel, the other to Gibeah) and in the field, they struck down<a name="fnB1185" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1185"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>58</SUP></FONT></a> about thirty Israelites. 
<bqverse 32>32  Then the Benjaminites said, "They are defeated just as before." But the Israelites said, "Let's retreat<a name="fnB1186" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1186"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>59</SUP></FONT></a> and lure them<a name="fnB1187" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1187"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>60</SUP></FONT></a> away from the city into the main roads." 
<bqverse 33>33 <a name="fnB1188" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1188"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>61</SUP></FONT></a> All the men of Israel got up from their places and took their positions at Baal Tamar, while the Israelites hiding in ambush jumped out of their places west of Gibeah. 
<bqverse 34>34  Ten thousand men, well-trained soldiers from all Israel, then made a frontal assault against Gibeah--the battle was fierce.<a name="fnB1189" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1189"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>62</SUP></FONT></a> But the Benjaminites did not realize that disaster was at their doorstep.<a name="fnB1190" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1190"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>63</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 35>35  The LORD annihilated Benjamin before Israel; the Israelites struck down that day 25,100 sword-wielding Benjaminites.<a name="fnB1191" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1191"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>64</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 36>36  Then the Benjaminites saw they were defeated.<p>
The Israelites retreated before<a name="fnB1192" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1192"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>65</SUP></FONT></a> Benjamin, because they had confidence in the men they had hid in ambush outside Gibeah. 
<bqverse 37>37  The men hiding in ambush made a mad dash<a name="fnB1193" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1193"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>66</SUP></FONT></a> to Gibeah. They<a name="fnB1194" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1194"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>67</SUP></FONT></a> attacked<a name="fnB1195" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1195"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>68</SUP></FONT></a> and put the sword to the entire city. 
<bqverse 38>38  The Israelites and the men hiding in ambush had arranged a signal. When the men hiding in ambush<a name="fnB1196" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1196"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>69</SUP></FONT></a> sent up a smoke signal from the city, 
<bqverse 39>39  the Israelites counterattacked.<a name="fnB1197" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1197"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>70</SUP></FONT></a> Benjamin had begun to strike down the Israelites;<a name="fnB1198" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1198"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>71</SUP></FONT></a> they struck down<a name="fnB1199" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1199"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>72</SUP></FONT></a> about thirty men. They said, "There's no doubt about it! They are totally defeated as in the earlier battle." 
<bqverse 40>40  But when the signal, a pillar of smoke, began to rise up from the city, the Benjaminites turned around and saw the whole city going up in a cloud of smoke that rose high into the sky.<a name="fnB1200" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1200"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>73</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 41>41  When the Israelites turned around, the Benjaminites panicked<a name="fnB1201" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1201"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>74</SUP></FONT></a> because they could see that disaster was on their doorstep.<a name="fnB1202" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1202"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>75</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 42>42  They retreated before the Israelites, taking the road to the wilderness. But the battle overtook<a name="fnB1203" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1203"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>76</SUP></FONT></a> them as men from the surrounding cities struck them down.<a name="fnB1204" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1204"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>77</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 43>43  They surrounded the Benjaminites, chased them from Nohah,<a name="fnB1205" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1205"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>78</SUP></FONT></a> and annihilated<a name="fnB1206" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1206"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>79</SUP></FONT></a> them all the way to a spot east of Geba.<a name="fnB1207" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1207"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>80</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 44>44  Eighteen thousand Benjaminites, all of them capable warriors, fell dead. 
<bqverse 45>45  The rest<a name="fnB1208" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1208"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>81</SUP></FONT></a> turned and ran toward the wilderness, heading toward the cliff of Rimmon. But the Israelites<a name="fnB1209" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1209"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>82</SUP></FONT></a> caught<a name="fnB1210" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1210"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>83</SUP></FONT></a> five thousand of them on the main roads. They stayed right on their heels<a name="fnB1211" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1211"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>84</SUP></FONT></a> all the way to Gidom and struck down two thousand more. 
<bqverse 46>46  That day twenty-five thousand<a name="fnB1212" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1212"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>85</SUP></FONT></a> sword-wielding Benjaminites fell in battle, all of them capable warriors.<a name="fnB1213" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1213"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>86</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 47>47  Six hundred survivors turned and ran away to the wilderness, to the cliff of Rimmon. They stayed there four months. 
<bqverse 48>48  The Israelites returned to the Benjaminite towns<a name="fnB1214" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1214"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>87</SUP></FONT></a> and put the sword to them. They wiped out the cities,<a name="fnB1215" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1215"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>88</SUP></FONT></a> the animals, and everything they could find. They set fire to every city in their path.<a name="fnB1216" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1216"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>89</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>600 Brides for 600 Brothers</i>
<p><A NAME="21"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> The Israelites had taken an oath in Mizpah, saying, "Not one of us will allow his daughter to marry a Benjaminite." 
<bqverse 2>2  So the people came to Bethel and sat there before God until evening, weeping loudly and uncontrollably.<a name="fnB1217" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1217"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 3>3  They said, "Why, O LORD God of Israel, has this happened in Israel?" An entire<a name="fnB1218" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1218"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> tribe has disappeared from Israel today!"<p>

<bqverse 4>4  The next morning the people got up early and built an altar there. They offered up burnt sacrifices and token of peace.<a name="fnB1219" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1219"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  The Israelites asked, "Who from all the Israelite tribes has not assembled before the LORD?" They had made a solemn oath that whoever did not assemble before the LORD at Mizpah must certainly be executed.<a name="fnB1220" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1220"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  The Israelites regretted what had happened to<a name="fnB1221" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1221"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> their brother Benjamin. They said, "Today we cut off an entire<a name="fnB1222" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1222"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> tribe from Israel! 
<bqverse 7>7  How can we find wives for those who are left?<a name="fnB1223" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1223"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> After all, we took an oath in the LORD's name not to give them our daughters as wives." 
<bqverse 8>8  So they asked, "Who from all the Israelite tribes did not assemble before the LORD at Mizpah?" Now it just so happened no one from Jabesh Gilead had come to the gathering.<a name="fnB1224" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1224"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  When they took roll call,<a name="fnB1225" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1225"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> they noticed<a name="fnB1226" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1226"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead were there. 
<bqverse 10>10  So the assembly sent 12,000 capable warriors<a name="fnB1227" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1227"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> against Jabesh Gilead.<a name="fnB1228" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1228"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> They commanded them, "Go and kill with your swords<a name="fnB1229" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1229"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead, including the women and little children. 
<bqverse 11>11  Do this:<a name="fnB1230" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1230"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> exterminate every male, as well as every woman who has had sexual relations with a male.<a name="fnB1231" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1231"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> But spare the lives of any virgins." So they did as instructed.<a name="fnB1232" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1232"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  They found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young girls who were virgins--they had never had sexual relations with a male.<a name="fnB1233" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1233"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> They brought them back to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan.<p>

<bqverse 13>13  The entire assembly sent messengers to the Benjaminites at the cliff of Rimmon and assured them they would not be harmed.<a name="fnB1234" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1234"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  The Benjaminites returned at that time, and the Israelites<a name="fnB1235" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1235"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> gave to them the women they had spared from Jabesh Gilead. But there were not enough to go around.<a name="fnB1236" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1236"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 15>15  The people regretted what had happened to<a name="fnB1237" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1237"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> Benjamin because the LORD had weakened<a name="fnB1238" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1238"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> the Israelite tribes. 
<bqverse 16>16  The leaders<a name="fnB1239" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1239"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> of the assembly said, "How can we find wives for those who are left?<a name="fnB1240" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1240"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> After all, the Benjaminite women have been wiped out. 
<bqverse 17>17  The<a name="fnB1241" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1241"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> remnant of Benjamin must be preserved. An entire Israelite tribe should not be wiped out.<a name="fnB1242" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1242"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  But we can't allow our daughters to marry them,<a name="fnB1243" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1243"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> for the Israelites took an oath, saying, `Whoever gives a woman to a Benjaminite will be destroyed!'<a name="fnB1244" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1244"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 19>19  However, there is an annual festival to the LORD in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel (east of the main road that goes up from Bethel to Shechem) and south of Lebonah." 
<bqverse 20>20  So they commanded the Benjaminites, "Go hide in the vineyards, 
<bqverse 21>21 and keep your eyes open.<a name="fnB1245" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1245"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> When you see<a name="fnB1246" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1246"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> the daughters of Shiloh coming out to dance in the celebration,<a name="fnB1247" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1247"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> jump out from the vineyards. Each one of you, catch yourself a wife from among the daughters of Shiloh and then go home to the land of Benjamin. 
<bqverse 22>22  When their fathers or brothers come and protest to us,<a name="fnB1248" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1248"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> we'll say to them, "Do us a favor and let them be,<a name="fnB1249" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1249"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> for we could not get each one a wife through battle.<a name="fnB1250" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1250"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> Don't worry about breaking your oath!<a name="fnB1251" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1251"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> You would only be guilty if you had voluntarily given them wives."<a name="fnB1252" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1252"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 23>23  The Benjaminites did as instructed.<a name="fnB1253" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1253"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT></a> They abducted two hundred of the dancing girls to be their wives.<a name="fnB1254" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1254"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>38</SUP></FONT></a> They went home<a name="fnB1255" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1255"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>39</SUP></FONT></a> to their own territory,<a name="fnB1256" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1256"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT></a> rebuilt their cities, and settled down.<a name="fnB1257" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1257"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>41</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  Then the Israelites dispersed from there to their respective tribal and clan territories. Each went from there to his own property.<a name="fnB1258" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1258"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>42</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 25>25  In those days Israel had no king. Each man did what he considered to be right.<a name="fnB1259" href="jdg_note.htm#fn1259"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>43</SUP></FONT></a></p>
