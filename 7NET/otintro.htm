<p>
The Old Testament books are preliminary drafts that have not been edited for accuracy, consistency or style of English translation. Many changes will be made before version 1.0 of the Old Testament is released.<p>
These preliminary drafts have been included to give you an impression of what the finished product will be like.</p>
