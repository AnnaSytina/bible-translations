<p><A NAME="1"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> From James,<a name="fnB0" href="jam_note.htm#fn0"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> a slave<a name="fnB1" href="jam_note.htm#fn1"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> of God and of Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes dispersed abroad.<a name="fnB2" href="jam_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> Greetings! <a name="_Toc403222007"></a><a name="_Toc416894497"></a><a name="_Toc432265360"></a><a name="_Toc485060301"></a><a name="_Toc494013798"></a></p>
<p><i>Joy in Trials</i>
<p>
<bqverse 2>2  My brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB3" href="jam_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> consider it nothing but joy<a name="fnB4" href="jam_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> when you fall into all sorts of trials, 
<bqverse 3>3  because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance. 
<bqverse 4>4  And let endurance have its perfect effect, so that you will be perfect and complete, not deficient in anything. 
<bqverse 5>5  But if anyone is deficient in wisdom, he should ask God, who gives to all generously and without reprimand, and it will be given to him. 
<bqverse 6>6  But he must ask in faith without doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed around by the wind. 
<bqverse 7>7  For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord, 
<bqverse 8>8  since he is a double-minded man,<a name="fnB5" href="jam_note.htm#fn5"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> unstable in all his ways.<p>

<bqverse 9>9  Now the believer<a name="fnB6" href="jam_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> of humble means<a name="fnB7" href="jam_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> should take pride<a name="fnB8" href="jam_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> in his high position.<a name="fnB9" href="jam_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  But the rich person's pride should be in his humiliation, because he will pass away like a wildflower in the meadow.<a name="fnB10" href="jam_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  For the sun rises with its heat and dries up the meadow; the petal of the flower falls off and its beauty is lost forever.<a name="fnB11" href="jam_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> So also the rich person in the midst of his pursuits will wither away. 
<bqverse 12>12  Happy is the one<a name="fnB12" href="jam_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> who endures testing, because when he has proven to be genuine, he will receive the crown of life that God<a name="fnB13" href="jam_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> promised to those who love him. 
<bqverse 13>13  Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God," for God cannot be tempted by evil,<a name="fnB14" href="jam_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> and he himself tempts no one. 
<bqverse 14>14  But each one is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desires. 
<bqverse 15>15  Then when desire conceives, it gives birth to sin, and when sin is full grown, it gives birth to death. 
<bqverse 16>16  Do not be led astray, my dear brothers and sisters.<a name="fnB15" href="jam_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  All generous giving and every perfect gift<a name="fnB16" href="jam_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> is from above, coming down<a name="fnB17" href="jam_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or the slightest hint of change.<a name="fnB18" href="jam_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  By his sovereign plan he gave us birth<a name="fnB19" href="jam_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> through the message of truth, that we would be a kind of firstfruits of all he created.<a name="_Toc403222008"></a><a name="_Toc416894498"></a><a name="_Toc432265361"></a><a name="_Toc485060302"></a><a name="_Toc494013799"></a></p>
<p><i>Living Out the Message</i>
<p>
<bqverse 19>19  Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters!<a name="fnB20" href="jam_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> Let every person be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger. 
<bqverse 20>20  For human<a name="fnB21" href="jam_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> anger does not accomplish God's righteousness.<a name="fnB22" href="jam_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 21>21  So put away all filth and evil excess and humbly<a name="fnB23" href="jam_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> welcome the message implanted within you, which is able to save your souls. 
<bqverse 22>22  But be sure you live out the message and do not merely listen to it and so deceive yourselves. 
<bqverse 23>23  For if someone merely listens to the message and does not live it out, he is like someone<a name="fnB24" href="jam_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> who gazes at his own face<a name="fnB25" href="jam_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> in a mirror. 
<bqverse 24>24  For he gazes at himself and then goes out and immediately forgets<a name="fnB26" href="jam_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> what sort of person he was. 
<bqverse 25>25  But the one who peers into the perfect law of liberty and fixes his attention there,<a name="fnB27" href="jam_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> and does not become a forgetful listener but one who lives it out--he<a name="fnB28" href="jam_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> will be blessed in what he does.<a name="fnB29" href="jam_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 26>26  If someone thinks he is religious yet does not bridle his tongue, and so deceives his heart, his religion is futile. 
<bqverse 27>27  Pure and undefiled religion before<a name="fnB30" href="jam_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> God the Father<a name="fnB31" href="jam_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a> is this: to care for orphans and widows in their misfortune and to keep oneself unstained by the world.

<p><i>Prejudice and the Law of Love</i>
<p><A NAME="2"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> My brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB32" href="jam_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> do not show prejudice<a name="fnB33" href="jam_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> if you possess faith<a name="fnB34" href="jam_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ.<a name="fnB35" href="jam_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  For if someone<a name="fnB36" href="jam_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> comes into your assembly<a name="fnB37" href="jam_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> wearing a gold ring and fine clothing, and a poor person enters in filthy clothes, 
<bqverse 3>3  do you pay attention to the one finely dressed and say,<a name="fnB38" href="jam_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> "You sit here in a good place,"<a name="fnB39" href="jam_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> and to the poor person, "You stand over there," or "Sit under my feet"?<a name="fnB40" href="jam_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  If so, have you not made distinctions<a name="fnB41" href="jam_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> among yourselves and become judges with evil motives?<a name="fnB42" href="jam_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 5>5  Listen, my dear brothers and sisters!<a name="fnB43" href="jam_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> Did not God choose the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that he promised to those who love him? 
<bqverse 6>6  But you have dishonored the poor!<a name="fnB44" href="jam_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> Are not the rich oppressing you and dragging you into the courts? 
<bqverse 7>7  Do they not blaspheme the good name of the one you belong to?<a name="fnB45" href="jam_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  But if you fulfill the royal law as expressed in this scripture,<a name="fnB46" href="jam_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> "<b><i>You shall love your neighbor as yourself</i></b>,"<a name="fnB47" href="jam_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> you are doing well. 
<bqverse 9>9  But if you show prejudice, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as violators.<a name="fnB48" href="jam_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  For the one who obeys the whole law but fails<a name="fnB49" href="jam_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> in one point has become guilty of all of it.<a name="fnB50" href="jam_note.htm#fn50"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  For he who said, "<b><i>Do not commit adultery</i></b>,"<a name="fnB51" href="jam_note.htm#fn51"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> also said, "<b><i>Do not murder</i></b>."<a name="fnB52" href="jam_note.htm#fn52"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> Now if you do not commit adultery but you commit murder, you have become a violator of the law. 
<bqverse 12>12  Speak and act as those who will be judged by a law that gives freedom.<a name="fnB53" href="jam_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 13>13  For judgment is merciless for the one who has shown no mercy. But mercy triumphs over<a name="fnB54" href="jam_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> judgment.<a name="_Toc403222010"></a><a name="_Toc416894500"></a><a name="_Toc432265363"></a><a name="_Toc485060304"></a><a name="_Toc494013801"></a></p>
<p><i>Faith and Works Together</i>
<p>
<bqverse 14>14  What good is it, my brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB55" href="jam_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> if someone claims to have faith but does not have works? Can this kind of faith<a name="fnB56" href="jam_note.htm#fn56"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> save him?<a name="fnB57" href="jam_note.htm#fn57"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 15>15  If a brother or sister<a name="fnB58" href="jam_note.htm#fn58"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> is poorly clothed and lacks daily food, 
<bqverse 16>16  and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, keep warm and eat well," but you do not give them what the body needs,<a name="fnB59" href="jam_note.htm#fn59"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> what good is it? 
<bqverse 17>17  So also faith, if it does not have works, is dead being by itself. 
<bqverse 18>18  But someone will say, "You have faith and I have works."<a name="fnB60" href="jam_note.htm#fn60"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a> Show me your faith without works and I will show faith by<a name="fnB61" href="jam_note.htm#fn61"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a> my works. 
<bqverse 19>19  You believe that God is one; well and good.<a name="fnB62" href="jam_note.htm#fn62"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>31</SUP></FONT></a> Even the demons believe that--and tremble with fear.<a name="fnB63" href="jam_note.htm#fn63"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>32</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 20>20  But would you like evidence,<a name="fnB64" href="jam_note.htm#fn64"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></a> you empty person,<a name="fnB65" href="jam_note.htm#fn65"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>34</SUP></FONT></a> that faith without works is useless? 
<bqverse 21>21  Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? 
<bqverse 22>22  You see that his faith was working together with his works and his faith was perfected by works. 
<bqverse 23>23  And the scripture was fulfilled that says, "<b><i>Now Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness</i></b>,"<a name="fnB66" href="jam_note.htm#fn66"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT></a> and<i> he was called God's friend</i>.<a name="fnB67" href="jam_note.htm#fn67"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 24>24  You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. 
<bqverse 25>25  And similarly, was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out by another way? 
<bqverse 26>26  For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.

<p><i>The Power of the Tongue</i>
<p><A NAME="3"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB68" href="jam_note.htm#fn68"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> because you know that we will be judged more strictly.<a name="fnB69" href="jam_note.htm#fn69"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  For we all stumble<a name="fnB70" href="jam_note.htm#fn70"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> in many ways. If someone does not stumble<a name="fnB71" href="jam_note.htm#fn71"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> in what he says,<a name="fnB72" href="jam_note.htm#fn72"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> he is a perfect individual,<a name="fnB73" href="jam_note.htm#fn73"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> able to control the entire body as well. 
<bqverse 3>3  And if we put bits into the mouths of horses to get them to obey us, then we guide their entire bodies.<a name="fnB74" href="jam_note.htm#fn74"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  Look at ships too: though they are so large and driven by harsh winds, they are steered by a tiny rudder wherever the pilot's impulse directs. 
<bqverse 5>5  So too the tongue is a small part of the body,<a name="fnB75" href="jam_note.htm#fn75"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> yet it has great pretensions.<a name="fnB76" href="jam_note.htm#fn76"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> Think<a name="fnB77" href="jam_note.htm#fn77"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> how small a flame sets a huge forest ablaze. 
<bqverse 6>6  And the tongue is a fire! The tongue represents<a name="fnB78" href="jam_note.htm#fn78"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> the world of wrongdoing among the parts of our bodies, that pollutes the entire body and sets fire to the course of human existence and is set on fire by hell.<a name="fnB79" href="jam_note.htm#fn79"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 7>7  For every kind of animal, bird, reptile, and sea creature<a name="fnB80" href="jam_note.htm#fn80"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> is subdued and has been subdued by humankind.<a name="fnB81" href="jam_note.htm#fn81"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 8>8  But no human can subdue the tongue; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. 
<bqverse 9>9  With it we bless the Lord and Father and with it we curse people<a name="fnB82" href="jam_note.htm#fn82"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> made in God's image. 
<bqverse 10>10  From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. These things should not be so, my brothers and sisters.<a name="fnB83" href="jam_note.htm#fn83"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 11>11  A spring does not pour out fresh water and bitter water from the same opening, does it? 
<bqverse 12>12  Can a fig tree produce olives, my brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB84" href="jam_note.htm#fn84"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> or a vine produce figs? Neither can a salt-water spring produce fresh water.<a name="_Toc403222012"></a><a name="_Toc416894502"></a><a name="_Toc432265365"></a><a name="_Toc485060306"></a><a name="_Toc494013803"></a></p>
<p><i>True Wisdom</i>
<p>
<bqverse 13>13  Which of you<a name="fnB85" href="jam_note.htm#fn85"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> is wise and understanding? By his good conduct he should show his works done in the gentleness that wisdom brings.<a name="fnB86" href="jam_note.htm#fn86"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 14>14  But if you have bitter jealousy and selfishness in your hearts, do not boast and tell lies against the truth. 
<bqverse 15>15  Such<a name="fnB87" href="jam_note.htm#fn87"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> wisdom does not come<a name="fnB88" href="jam_note.htm#fn88"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> from above but is earthly, natural,<a name="fnB89" href="jam_note.htm#fn89"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> demonic. 
<bqverse 16>16  For where there is jealousy and selfishness, there is disorder and every evil practice. 
<bqverse 17>17  But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, accommodating,<a name="fnB90" href="jam_note.htm#fn90"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a> full of mercy and good fruit,<a name="fnB91" href="jam_note.htm#fn91"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a> impartial, and not hypocritical.<a name="fnB92" href="jam_note.htm#fn92"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 18>18  And the fruit that consists of righteousness<a name="fnB93" href="jam_note.htm#fn93"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a> is planted<a name="fnB94" href="jam_note.htm#fn94"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>27</SUP></FONT></a> in peace among<a name="fnB95" href="jam_note.htm#fn95"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> those who make peace.

<p><i>Passions and Pride</i>
<p><A NAME="4"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Where do the conflicts and where<a name="fnB96" href="jam_note.htm#fn96"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> do the quarrels among you come from? Is it not from this,<a name="fnB97" href="jam_note.htm#fn97"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> from your passions that battle inside you?<a name="fnB98" href="jam_note.htm#fn98"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 2>2  You desire and you do not have; you murder and envy and you cannot obtain; you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask; 
<bqverse 3>3  you ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly, so you can spend it on your passions.<p>

<bqverse 4>4  Adulterers, do you not know that friendship with the world means hostility towards God?<a name="fnB99" href="jam_note.htm#fn99"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> So whoever decides to be the world's friend makes himself God's enemy. 
<bqverse 5>5  Or do you think the scripture means nothing when it says,<a name="fnB100" href="jam_note.htm#fn100"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> "The spirit that God<a name="fnB101" href="jam_note.htm#fn101"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> caused to live within us has an envious yearning"?<a name="fnB102" href="jam_note.htm#fn102"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  But he gives greater grace. Therefore it says, "<b><i>God opposes the proud</i></b><i>,<b> but he gives grace to the humble</b></i>."<a name="fnB103" href="jam_note.htm#fn103"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 7>7  So submit to God. But resist the devil and he will flee from you. 
<bqverse 8>8  Draw near to God and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and make your hearts pure, you double-minded.<a name="fnB104" href="jam_note.htm#fn104"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 9>9  Grieve, mourn,<a name="fnB105" href="jam_note.htm#fn105"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> and weep. Turn your laughter<a name="fnB106" href="jam_note.htm#fn106"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> into mourning and your joy into despair. 
<bqverse 10>10  Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you.<p>

<bqverse 11>11  Do not speak against one another, brothers and sisters.<a name="fnB107" href="jam_note.htm#fn107"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> He who speaks against a fellow believer<a name="fnB108" href="jam_note.htm#fn108"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> or judges a fellow believer speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but its judge.<a name="fnB109" href="jam_note.htm#fn109"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  But there is only one who is lawgiver and judge--the one who is able to save and destroy. On the other hand, who are you to judge your neighbor?<a name="fnB110" href="jam_note.htm#fn110"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a><p>

<bqverse 13>13  Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go into this or that town<a name="fnB111" href="jam_note.htm#fn111"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> and spend a year there and do business and make a profit." 
<bqverse 14>14  You<a name="fnB112" href="jam_note.htm#fn112"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> do not know about tomorrow. What is your life like?<a name="fnB113" href="jam_note.htm#fn113"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> For you are a puff of smoke<a name="fnB114" href="jam_note.htm#fn114"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> that appears for a short time and then vanishes. 
<bqverse 15>15  You ought to say instead,<a name="fnB115" href="jam_note.htm#fn115"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> "If the Lord is willing, then we will live and do this or that." 
<bqverse 16>16  But as it is,<a name="fnB116" href="jam_note.htm#fn116"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil. 
<bqverse 17>17  So whoever knows what is good to do<a name="fnB117" href="jam_note.htm#fn117"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> and does not do it is guilty of sin.<a name="fnB118" href="jam_note.htm#fn118"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a>

<p><i>Warning to the Rich</i>
<p><A NAME="5"><b>
<bqverse 1>1 </b> Come now, you rich! Weep and cry aloud<a name="fnB119" href="jam_note.htm#fn119"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> over the miseries that are coming on you. 
<bqverse 2>2  Your riches have rotted and your clothing has become moth-eaten. 
<bqverse 3>3  Your gold and silver have rusted and their rust will be a witness against you. It will consume your flesh like fire. It is in the last days that you have hoarded treasure!<a name="fnB120" href="jam_note.htm#fn120"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 4>4  Look, the pay you have held back from the workers who mowed your fields cries out against you, and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. 
<bqverse 5>5  You have lived indulgently and luxuriously on the earth. You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.<a name="fnB121" href="jam_note.htm#fn121"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 6>6  You have condemned and murdered the righteous person, although he does not resist you.<a name="fnB122" href="jam_note.htm#fn122"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a><a name="_Toc403222015"></a><a name="_Toc416894505"></a><a name="_Toc432265368"></a><a name="_Toc485060309"></a><a name="_Toc494013806"></a></p>
<p><i>Patience in Suffering</i>
<p>
<bqverse 7>7  So be patient, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB123" href="jam_note.htm#fn123"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a> until the Lord's coming. Think of how the farmer waits<a name="fnB124" href="jam_note.htm#fn124"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> for the precious fruit of the ground and is patient<a name="fnB125" href="jam_note.htm#fn125"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> for it until it receives the early and late rains. 
<bqverse 8>8  You also be patient and strengthen your hearts, for the Lord's coming is near. 
<bqverse 9>9  Do not grumble against one another, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB126" href="jam_note.htm#fn126"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> so that you may not be judged. See, the judge stands before the gates!<a name="fnB127" href="jam_note.htm#fn127"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 10>10  As an example of suffering and patience, brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB128" href="jam_note.htm#fn128"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> take the prophets who spoke in the Lord's name. 
<bqverse 11>11  Think of how we regard<a name="fnB129" href="jam_note.htm#fn129"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> as blessed those who have endured. You have heard of Job's endurance and you have seen the Lord's purpose, that <i>the Lord is full of compassion and merciful</i>.<a name="fnB130" href="jam_note.htm#fn130"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 12>12  And above all, my brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB131" href="jam_note.htm#fn131"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath. But let your "Yes" be yes and your "No" be no, so that you may not fall into judgment.<a name="_Toc403222016"></a><a name="_Toc416894506"></a><a name="_Toc432265369"></a><a name="_Toc485060310"></a><a name="_Toc494013807"></a></p>
<p><i>Prayer for the Sick</i>
<p>
<bqverse 13>13  Is anyone among you suffering? He should pray. Is anyone in good spirits? He should sing praises. 
<bqverse 14>14  Is anyone among you ill? He should summon the elders of the church, and they should pray for him and anoint<a name="fnB132" href="jam_note.htm#fn132"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> him with oil in the name of the Lord. 
<bqverse 15>15  And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick and the Lord will raise him up--and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.<a name="fnB133" href="jam_note.htm#fn133"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 16>16  So confess your sins to one another and pray for one another so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great effectiveness.<a name="fnB134" href="jam_note.htm#fn134"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a> 
<bqverse 17>17  Elijah was a human being like us, and he prayed earnestly<a name="fnB135" href="jam_note.htm#fn135"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> that it would not rain and there was no rain on the land for three years and six months! 
<bqverse 18>18  Then<a name="fnB136" href="jam_note.htm#fn136"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> he prayed again, and the sky gave rain and the land sprouted with a harvest.<p>

<bqverse 19>19  My brothers and sisters,<a name="fnB137" href="jam_note.htm#fn137"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a> if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone turns him back, 
<bqverse 20>20  he should know that the one who turns a sinner back from his wandering path<a name="fnB138" href="jam_note.htm#fn138"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> will save that person's<a name="fnB139" href="jam_note.htm#fn139"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.</p>
