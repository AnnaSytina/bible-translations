 <b>tn </b> (1:1) <i>Heb</i> "and it was in the days of the judging of the judges." Instead of "in the days of the judging of the judges," the LXX reads, "when the judges judged," and the Syriac has "in the days of the judges."<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:1)  The reference to <i>the time of the judges</i> is no mere chronological note. By informing us that this story took place during the morally corrupt <i>time of the judges</i>, the author paints a dark backdrop against which Ruth's exemplary character and actions will shine even more brightly.<br>
 <a name="fn1" href="rut.htm#fnB1"><sup>2</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:1) <i>Heb</i> "he and his wife and his two sons." The LXX omits "two."<br>

 <a name="fn4" href="rut.htm#fnB4"><sup>5</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:2) Ephrathah is either another name for Bethlehem (see Ruth 4:11; Mic 5:2 and <i>HALOT</i> 81) or a small village in the vicinity of Bethlehem (see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth</i>, 64). The designation "Ephrathites" may then simply indicate that they were residents of Ephrathah. However, because the phrase "from Bethlehem" immediately follows, some regard "Ephrathite" as indicating one of the clans living in Bethlehem (see R. L. Hubbard, Jr., <i>Ruth</i>, 91).<br>

 <a name="fn9" href="rut.htm#fnB9"><sup>10</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:5) The Hebrew term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dly</FONT> is used only here of a married man. By shifting to this word from the more common term "sons" (see vv. 1-5a) and then using it in an unusual manner, the author draws attention to Naomi's loss and sets up a verbal link with the story's conclusion (cf. 4:16; see also E. F. Campbell, Jr., <i>Ruth</i>, 56, and F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth</i>, 66).<br>
 <a name="fn10" href="rut.htm#fnB10"><sup>11</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:6) <i>Heb</i> "and she arose, along with her daughters-in-law, and she returned from the region of Moab."<br>

 <a name="fn12" href="rut.htm#fnB12"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:6) <i>Heb</i> "that the LORD had visited his people by giving to them food." The infinitive construct with preposition -<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l</FONT> here indicates the manner in which God "visited" his people.<br>
 <a name="fn13" href="rut.htm#fnB13"><sup>14</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:7) <i>Heb</i> "and she went out from the place where she had been, and her two daughters-in-law [were] with her, and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah."<br>
 <a name="fn14" href="rut.htm#fnB14"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:8) <i>Heb</i> "each to the house of her mother." Naomi's words imply that it is more appropriate for the two widows to go home to their mothers, rather than stay with their mother-in-law (see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth</i>, 75).<br>
 <a name="fn15" href="rut.htm#fnB15"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tc</b> (1:8)  The consonantal text (Kethib) has the imperfect, "(the LORD) will do," but the marginal reading (Qere) has the shortened jussive form, "may [the LORD] do," which is more probable in this prayer of blessing.<br>
 <b>tn</b> (1:8)  <i>Heb</i> "do with you." The pronominal suffix "you" appears to be a masculine form, but this is likely a preservation of an archaic dual form (see E. F. Campbell, Jr., <i>Ruth</i>, 65, and F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth</i>, 75-76).<br>
 <a name="fn16" href="rut.htm#fnB16"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:8) That is, their deceased husbands.<br>
 <a name="fn17" href="rut.htm#fnB17"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:8) <i>Heb</i> "devotion as you have done with the dead and with me." The noun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dsj</FONT>, "devotion," is a key thematic term in the Book of Ruth (see 2:20; 3:10). The term has been the subject of several monographs. G. R. Clark concludes that <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dsj</FONT> "is not merely an attitude or an emotion; it is an emotion that leads to an activity beneficial to the recipient." He explains that an act of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">dsj</FONT> is "a beneficent action performed, in the context of a deep and enduring commitment between two persons or parties, by one who is able to render assistance to the needy party who in the circumstances is unable to help him- or herself" (G. R. Clark, <i>The Word </i>Hesed<i> in the Hebrew Bible</i>, 267). <i>HALOT</i> 336-37 defines the word as "loyalty," or "faithfulness." Other appropriate glosses might be "commitment" and "devotion."<br>
 <a name="fn18" href="rut.htm#fnB18"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:9) <i>Heb</i> "may the LORD give to you, and find rest, each [in] the house of her husband." The syntax is unusual, but, following the jussive ("may he give"), the imperative with <i>vav</i> conjunctive ("and find") probably indicates a consequence of the preceding action.<br>
 <a name="fn19" href="rut.htm#fnB19"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:9) <i>Heb</i> "and they lifted their voice[s] and wept." The expression refers to loud weeping characteristic of those mourning a tragedy (see Judg 21:2; 2 Sam 13:36; Job 2:12).<br>
 <a name="fn20" href="rut.htm#fnB20"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:10) <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK</FONT> here has the force of "no, on the contrary" (see Gen 31:26; Ps 44:22, and <i>HALOT</i> 470).<br>
 <a name="fn21" href="rut.htm#fnB21"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:10) Or perhaps "we want to," if the imperfect is understood in a modal sense indicating desire.<br>
 <a name="fn22" href="rut.htm#fnB22"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:11) Or "Why do you want to come with me?"<br>
 <a name="fn23" href="rut.htm#fnB23"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:11) <i>Heb</i> "Do I still have sons in my inner parts that they might become your husbands?"<br>

 <a name="fn25" href="rut.htm#fnB25"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:12) Verse 12b contains the protasis ("if" clause) of a conditional sentence, which is completed by the rhetorical questions in v. 13. For a detailed syntactical analysis, see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth</i>, 78-79. <br>
 <a name="fn26" href="rut.htm#fnB26"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:13) <i>Heb</i> "For them would you wait until they were grown?" Some understand <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/hlh</FONT> as an interrogative he with an Aramaic particle meaning "therefore" (see GKC &#167;103.<i>b</i>.2 [n. 4]), while others understand the form to consist of an interrogative he, the preposition -<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">l</FONT>, "for," and an apparent third feminine plural pronominal suffix. The feminine suffix is problematic, for its antecedent is the hypothetical "sons" mentioned at the end of v. 12. For this reason some emend the form to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;hlh</FONT>, "for them" (with a third masculine plural suffix). Hubbard raises the possibility that the nunated suffix is an archaic Moabite masculine dual form (R. L. Hubbard, Jr., <i>Ruth</i>, 111, n. 31).<br>
 <a name="fn27" href="rut.htm#fnB27"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:13) <i>Heb</i> "For them would you hold yourselves back so as not to be for a man?" The verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">/gu</FONT>, "hold back," occurs only here in the OT. For discussion of its etymology and meaning, see <i>HALOT</i> 787-88, and F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth</i>, 79-80. <br>
 <a name="fn28" href="rut.htm#fnB28"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:13) The negative is used here in an elliptical manner for emphasis (see <i>HALOT</i> 48; GKC &#167;152.<i>g</i>.<br>
 <a name="fn29" href="rut.htm#fnB29"><sup>30</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:13) The Hebrew text has simply, "no, my daughters." But if translated this way, one might think that Naomi is answering the rhetorical questions she has just asked. It seems more likely, in light of the explanatory clause that follows, that she is urging them to give up the idea of returning with her. In other words, the words "no, my daughters," complement the earlier exhortation to "go back." To clarify this, the words "you must not come with me" are added in the translation.<br>
 <a name="fn30" href="rut.htm#fnB30"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:13) <i>Heb</i> "for there is bitterness to me exceedingly from you." There are at least three ways to translate and interpret this statement. First, one could translate, "for I am very bitter because of [causal use of the preposition] you," that is, because of your widowed condition. However, this understanding of the statement does not fit well with the statement that follows ("for the LORD has attacked me"). Second, one could translate, "for I am more bitter than you are." A third possibility, the one reflected in the translation above, is to paraphrase, "for my intense bitterness is too much for you [i.e., to have to bear]." This interpretation is preferable because it logically fits with the preceding statement better than the second view. For a discussion of these views and a defense of the view chosen here, see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth</i>, 80-81.<br>
 <a name="fn31" href="rut.htm#fnB31"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:13) <i>Heb</i> "for the hand of the LORD has gone out against me." The expression suggests intense opposition and hostility. See R. L. Hubbard, Jr., <i>Ruth</i>, 113.<br>
 <a name="fn32" href="rut.htm#fnB32"><sup>33</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:14) <i>Heb</i> "and they lifted their voice[s] and wept" (see v. 9). The expression refers to loud weeping characteristic of those mourning a tragedy (see Judg 21:2; 2 Sam 13:36; Job 2:12).<br>
 <a name="fn33" href="rut.htm#fnB33"><sup>34</sup></a><b>tc </b> (1:14) The LXX adds, "and she returned to her people." Translated back to Hebrew, this would read: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hmu-la bvtw</FONT>. Most dismiss this as a clarifying addition added under the influence of v. 15, but this alternative reading should not be rejected too quickly. It is possible that a scribe's eye jumped from the initial <i>vav</i> on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bvtw</FONT>, "and she returned," to the initial <i>vav</i> on the final clause (note <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">tWrw</FONT>, "and Ruth") inadvertently leaving out the intervening words, "and she returned to her people." Or a scribe's eye could have jumped from the final <i>he</i> on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">Htomjl</FONT>, "to her mother-in-law," to the final <i>he</i> on <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">HMu</FONT>, "her people," leaving out the intervening words, "and she returned to her people."<br>
 <a name="fn34" href="rut.htm#fnB34"><sup>35</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:14) The clause is disjunctive. The word order is conjunction + subject + verb, highlighting the contrast between Orpah's and Ruth's actions. <br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:14)  <i>Orpah</i> is a literary foil for Ruth. Orpah is a commendable and devoted person (see v. 8); after all she is willing to follow Naomi back to Judah. However, when Naomi bombards her with good reasons why she should return, she relents. But Ruth is special. Despite Naomi's bitter tirade, she insists on staying. Orpah is a good person, but Ruth is beyond good--she possesses an extra measure of devotion and sacrificial love that is uncommon, even among the Orpahs of the world. <br>
 <a name="fn35" href="rut.htm#fnB35"><sup>36</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:14) The expression suggests strong commitment (see R. L. Hubbard, Jr., <i>Ruth</i>, 115).<br>
 <a name="fn36" href="rut.htm#fnB36"><sup>37</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:15) <i>Heb</i> "she"; the referent (Naomi) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn37" href="rut.htm#fnB37"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:15) Or "gods," if the plural form is taken as a numerical plural. However, it is likely that Naomi, speaking from Orpah's Moabite perspective, uses the plural of majesty of the Moabite god Chemosh. For examples of the plural of majesty being used of a pagan god, see BDB 43. Note especially 1 Kgs 11:33, where the plural form is used of Chemosh, the god of Moab.<br>
 <a name="fn38" href="rut.htm#fnB38"><sup>39</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:16) <i>Heb</i> "do not urge me to abandon you to turn back from after you." The use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">bzu</FONT>, "abandon," reflects Ruth's perspective. To return to Moab would be to abandon Naomi and to leave her even more vulnerable than she already is.<br>
 <a name="fn39" href="rut.htm#fnB39"><sup>40</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:17) <i>Heb</i> "thus the LORD will do to me and thus he will add--certainly death will separate me and you." Ruth here pronounces a curse upon herself, elevating the preceding promise to a formal, unconditional level. If she is not faithful to her promise, she agrees to become an object of divine judgment. As in other occurrences of this oath/curse formula, the specific punishment is not mentioned. As Bush explains, the particle <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yK</FONT> is here asseverative ("indeed, certainly") and the statement that follows "expresses what the speaker was determined <i>will</i> happen" (F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth</i>, 83; see 1 Sam 14:44; 2 Sam 3:9; 1 Kgs 2:23; 19:2). For the statement to mean "if even death separates you and me" (see E. F. Campbell, Jr., <i>Ruth</i>, 74-75), it would need to be introduced by <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;a</FONT>, "if," or negated by <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">al</FONT>, "not" (see Bush, <i>Ruth</i>, 83).<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:17)  Ruth's devotion to Naomi is especially apparent here. Instead of receiving a sure blessing and going home (see v. 8), Ruth instead takes on a serious responsibility and subjects herself to potential divine punishment. Death, a power beyond Ruth's control, <i>will separate</i> the two women, but until that time Ruth will stay by Naomi's side and she will even be buried in the same place as Naomi.<br>
 <a name="fn40" href="rut.htm#fnB40"><sup>41</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:18) <i>Heb</i> "she"; the referent (Naomi) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn41" href="rut.htm#fnB41"><sup>42</sup></a><b>tn</b> (1:18)  <i>Heb</i> "she"; the referent (Ruth) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br>
 <a name="fn42" href="rut.htm#fnB42"><sup>43</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:18) <i>Heb</i> "she ceased speaking to her." This does not imply that Naomi gave her the "cold shoulder" or "silent treatment." It simply means that Naomi stopped trying to convince her to go back to Moab (see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth</i>, 84-85).<br>
 <a name="fn43" href="rut.htm#fnB43"><sup>44</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:19) The pronominal suffix "them" appears to be a masculine form, but this is likely a preservation of an archaic dual form (see E. F. Campbell, Jr., <i>Ruth</i>, 65, and F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth</i>, 75-76).<br>
 <a name="fn44" href="rut.htm#fnB44"><sup>45</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:19) The temporal indicator <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yhyw</FONT> ("and it was") here introduces a new scene.<br>

 <a name="fn46" href="rut.htm#fnB46"><sup>47</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:19) <i>Heb</i> "they said," but the verb form is third feminine plural, indicating that the women of the town are the subject.<br>
 <a name="fn47" href="rut.htm#fnB47"><sup>48</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:19) Bush argues that the question here expresses surprise and delight, because of the way Naomi reacts to it (F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth</i>, 92).<br>

 <a name="fn52" href="rut.htm#fnB52"><sup>53</sup></a><b>sn </b> (1:20) The name <i>Mara</i> means "bitter."<br>
 <a name="fn53" href="rut.htm#fnB53"><sup>54</sup></a><b>sn </b> (1:20) The divine name translated <i>Sovereign One</i> is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yD^v^</FONT> ("Shaddai"). Shaddai (or El Shaddai) is the <i>sovereign</i> king/judge of the world who grants life/blesses and kills/judges. In the Book of Genesis he blesses the patriarchs with fertility and promises numerous descendants. Outside Genesis he both blesses/protects and takes away life/happiness. For a more detailed discussion of the meaning and significance of this divine name, see T. N. D. Mettinger, <i>In Search of God</i>, 69-72.<br>
 <a name="fn54" href="rut.htm#fnB54"><sup>55</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:20) Or "caused me to be very bitter."<br>

 <a name="fn56" href="rut.htm#fnB56"><sup>57</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:21) <i>Heb</i> "but empty the LORD has brought me back." The disjunctive clause structure (<i>vav</i> + adverb + verb + subject) highlights the contrast between her former condition and present situation.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:21)  <i>Empty-handed.</i> This statement is highly ironic, for ever-loyal Ruth stands by her side even as she speaks these words. But from Naomi's perspective, Ruth is insignificant. This perspective will, of course, prove to be inaccurate and the women will later correct Naomi's faulty view of Ruth's value (see 4:15).<br>
 <a name="fn57" href="rut.htm#fnB57"><sup>58</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:21) The disjunctive clause structure (<i>vav</i> + subject + verb) here introduces an attendant circumstance ("when the LORD has opposed me") or explanation ("seeing that the LORD has opposed me").<br>
 <a name="fn58" href="rut.htm#fnB58"><sup>59</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:21) <i>Heb</i> "has testified against me." The idiom -<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B hnu</FONT> ("testify against") is well-attested elsewhere in legal settings (see BDB 773; <i>HALOT</i> 852). Naomi uses a legal metaphor and depicts the LORD as one who has arisen in court and testified against her. The LXX reads "humbled me" here, apparently understanding the verb as a Piel (<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hN&#180;u!</FONT>) from a homonymic root meaning "afflict." However, <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hN&#180;u!</FONT>, "afflict," never introduces its object with -<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B=</FONT>; when the preposition -<FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">B=</FONT> is used with this verb, it is always adverbial ("in, with, through"). Therefore, to defend the LXX reading one would have to eliminate the preposition from the text.<br>
 <a name="fn59" href="rut.htm#fnB59"><sup>60</sup></a><b>sn </b> (1:21) The divine name translated <i>Sovereign One</i> is <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">yD^v^</FONT>, "Shaddai." See further the note on this term in Ruth 1:20.<br>

This summarizing statement provides closure to the first part of the story. By highlighting Ruth's willingness to return with Naomi, it also contrasts sharply with Naomi's remark about being empty-handed.<br>
 <a name="fn62" href="rut.htm#fnB62"><sup>63</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:22) The pronoun appears to be third masculine plural in form, but it is probably an archaic third person dual form (see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth</i>, 94).<br>
 <a name="fn63" href="rut.htm#fnB63"><sup>64</sup></a><b>tn </b> (1:22) This statement, introduced with a disjunctive structure (<i>vav</i> + subject + verb) provides closure for the previous scene, while at the same time making a transition to the next scene, which takes place in the barley field. The reference to the harvest also reminds us that God has been merciful to his people by replacing the famine with fertility. Will he do the same for Naomi and Ruth?<br>
 <b>sn</b> (1:22)  The <i>barley harvest</i> began in late March. See O. Borowski, <i>Agriculture in Iron Age Israel</i>, 91.<br>

This reading has the advantage of making Ruth the subject of all verbs in the verse, but one expects the accusative sign <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">ta</FONT> to appear before "her mother-in-law" if it were the object of the Hiphil verb.

In this case the antecedent of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> would be the immediately preceding "the LORD." However, this understanding of the construction is not accurate. The antecedent of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> is Boaz, not the LORD. Elsewhere when <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> follows the blessing formula <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">iWrB</FONT> (Qal passive participle) + proper name/pronoun, it always introduces the reason the recipient of the blessing deserves a reward. (For this reason one could analyze <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> as a causal conjunction in this construction.) If <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> refers to the LORD here, then this verse, unlike others using the construction, gives no such reason for the recipient being blessed. 2 Sam 2:5, which provides the closest structural parallel to Ruth 2:20, supports this interpretation: <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">lWav-&lt;u &lt;kynda-&lt;u hZh dsjh &lt;tycu rva hwhyl &lt;Ta &lt;ykrB</FONT>, "May you [plural] be blessed by the LORD, you who [plural]/because you [plural] have extended such kindness to your master Saul." Here <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> refers back to the second plural pronoun <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;Ta</FONT>, "you," in the formula, as the second plural verb <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">&lt;tycu</FONT> after <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT> indicates. Though <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hwhy</FONT> is in closer proximity to <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">rva</FONT>, it is not the antecedent. The evidence suggests that Ruth 2:20 should be translated and interpreted as follows: "May he [Boaz] be blessed by the LORD, he who [i.e., Boaz]/because he [i.e., Boaz] has not abandoned his loyalty to the living and dead." See B. A. Rebera, "Yahweh or Boaz? Ruth 2.20 Reconsidered," <i>BT</i> 36 (1985): 317-27, and F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth</i>, 134-36.

Since mourners would sometimes wear mourning clothes and refrain from washing or using cosmetics (Gen 38:14, 19; 2 Sam 12:20; 14:2), Ruth's attire and appearance would communicate that her period of mourning was over and that she was now available for remarriage.

For this reason "legs" or "lower body" is the preferred translation (see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth</i>, 152). Because "foot" is sometimes used euphemistically for the genitals, some feel that Ruth uncovered Boaz's genitals. For a critique of this view see Bush, <i>Ruth</i>, 153.

However, here in chap. 3, where Naomi sends her to Boaz to seek marriage, she uses the more elevated term <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hma</FONT> to describe herself because she is now aware of Boaz's responsibility as a close relative of her deceased husband and she wants to challenge him to fulfill his obligation. In her new social context she is dependent on Boaz (hence the use of <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hma</FONT>), but she is no mere <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hjpv</FONT>.<br>
 <a name="fn168" href="rut.htm#fnB168"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn </b> (3:9) <i>Heb</i> "and spread your wing over your servant" Many medieval Hebrew MSS have the plural/dual, "your wings," rather than the singular "your wing, skirt." The latter is more likely here in the context of Ruth's marriage proposal. In the metaphorical account in Ezek 16:8, God spreads his skirt over naked Jerusalem as an act of protection and as a precursor to marriage. Thus Ruth's words can be taken as a marriage proposal (and are so translated here). See F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth</i>, 164-65.<br>

For a discussion of the legal background assumed here, see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth</i>, 166-69.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (3:9)  By proposing marriage, Ruth goes beyond the letter of Naomi's instructions (see v. 4, where Naomi told Ruth that Boaz would tell her what to do).

The latter act of devotion is her decision to marry Boaz and thereby provide a child to carry on her deceased husband's (and Elimelech's line) and to provide for Naomi's needs in her old age (see Ruth 4:5, 10, 15). <br>

The Hebrew word order emphasizes Boaz's intention to fulfill Ruth's request. As in v. 5, the Hebrew imperfect is used (note "you are saying"), even though Ruth's request appears to be concluded. According to GKC &#167;107.<i>h</i>, the imperfect can sometimes "express actions, &amp;c, which although, strictly speaking, they are already finished, are regarded as still lasting on into the present time, or continuing to operate in it." The imperfect <FONT FACE="NetBibleHebrew">hcua</FONT> could be translated "I will do," but since there are legal complications which must first be resolved, it is better to take the form as indicating Boaz's desire or intention (if the legal matters can be worked out).<br>

 <b>sn </b> (4:1) <i>Mr. So-and-so</i>. Certainly Boaz would have used this individual's name, but the narrator leaves him anonymous. The closer relative, who is a literary foil for Boaz, refuses to fulfill the role of family guardian.

 <b>sn</b> (4:3)  <i>Naomi...is selling</i>. The nature of the sale is uncertain. Naomi may have been selling the property rights to the land, but this seems unlikely in light of what is known about ancient Israelite property laws. It is more likely that Naomi, being a woman, held only the right to use the land until the time of her remarriage or death. (See F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth</i>, 202-4.) Because she held this right to use of the land, she also had the right to buy it back from the its current owner. (This assumes that Elimelech sold the land prior to going to Moab.) Since she did not possess the means to do so, however, she decided to dispose of her rights in the matter. She was not selling the land per se, but disposing of the right to its redemption and use, probably in exchange for room and board with the purchaser (see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth</i>, 211-15). If this scenario is correct, it might be preferable to translate, "Naomi is disposing of her rights to the portion of land...."<br>

It is possible, however, that the phrases "before those sitting here" and "before the leaders of my people" are appositional and that both refer to the ten leaders mentioned in v. 2. <br>

Most prefer to emend the third person verb form ("he") to the second person form, because Boaz is addressing the closer relative.

It is not entirely clear how acquiring Ruth and raising up an heir for the Elimelech would ruin this individual's inheritance.

 <b>sn</b> (4:6)  It is not certain if the acquisition of Ruth along with the land was obligatory or voluntary. One gets the impression from v. 5 that it was obligatory. If so, how do we explain the closer relative's initial willingness to purchase the land? Did he not know about Ruth? Though one would think that he did (see 3:11), perhaps he was ignorant of Ruth's status or the details of the law. Boaz may have assumed he knew about Ruth and the law. Knowing his family circumstances (see v. 6), Boaz, by making the transaction appear to be a mere land deal, gave him a chance to surrender his option in a way that would save face. When the closer relative jumped at the land offer, Boaz was forced to confront him with the attendant obligation of marrying Ruth and raising up an heir for the deceased. According to Bush, acquiring Ruth was voluntary (F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth</i>, 229-33). However, by conducting the transaction in public where the close relative would need to save face, Boaz forced him either to reject the offer entirely or to include Ruth in the deal. Either way, Ruth would be cared for and Elimelech's line continued. In order to save face, he could not take the land and reject Ruth. But if he took Ruth, the acquisition of the land would be more economically burdensome than beneficial, so he yielded his purchase option to Boaz. <br>

The omission of the suffix with "name" could be explained as virtual haplography (note the letter <i>bet</i>, which is similar to <i>kaf</i>, at the beginning of the next word). The same explanation could account for the omission of the prefixed <i>yod</i> on the verb "call" (<i>yod</i> and <i>vav</i> are similar in appearance).
