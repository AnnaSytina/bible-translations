The Greek term <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">diasporav</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">diaspora</FONT>, "dispersion") refers to Jews not living in Palestine but "dispersed" or scattered among the Gentiles.

Incidentally, the conditional particle for the fourth class condition is also <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">eij</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">ei</FONT>). That may well be what was on Peter's mind, as evidenced by some of his other allusions to suffering in this little letter (3:14, 17).

This phrase may be a quotation from Isa 10:3, in which case judgment is in view here. But blessing seems to be the point, since part of the motive for good behavior is winning the non-Christian over to the faith (as in 3:1; also apparently in 3:15; cf. Matt 5:16).<br>

 <a name="fn82" href="1pe.htm#fnB82"><sup>38</sup></a><b>tn</b> (2:16)  Traditionally, "servants" or "bondservants." Though <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dou'lo"</FONT> (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">doulos</FONT>) is normally translated "servant," the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BAGD notes that "`servant' for `slave' is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times...in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished" (BAGD 205 s.v.). The most accurate translation is "bondservant" (sometimes found in the ASV for <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">dou'lo"</FONT>), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (2:16)  Undoubtedly the background for the concept of being the Lord's slave or servant is to be found in the Old Testament scriptures. For a Jew this concept did not connote drudgery, but honor and privilege. It was used of national Israel at times (Isa 43:10), but was especially associated with famous OT personalities, including such great men as Moses (Joshua 14:7), David (Ps 89:3; cf. 2 Sam 7:5, 8) and Elijah (2 Kings 10:10); all these men were "servants (or slaves) of the Lord."<br>

 <a name="fn128" href="1pe.htm#fnB128"><sup>28</sup></a><b>sn</b> (3:18)  This passage has been typeset as poetry because many scholars regard this passage as poetic or hymnic. These terms are used broadly to refer to the genre of writing, not to the content. There are two broad criteria for determining if a passage is poetic or hymnic: "(a) <i>stylistic:</i> a certain rhythmical lilt when the passages are read aloud, the presence of <i>parallelismus membrorum</i> (i.e., an arrangement into couplets), the semblance of some metre, and the presence of rhetorical devices such as alliteration, <i>chiasmus</i>, and antithesis; and (b) <i>linguistic: </i>an unusual vocabulary, particularly the presence of theological terms, which is different from the surrounding context" (P. T. O'Brien, <i>Philippians </i>[NIGTC], 188-9). Classifying a passage as hymnic or poetic is important because understanding this genre can provide keys to interpretation. However, not all scholars agree that the above criteria are present in this passage, so the decision to typeset it as poetry should be viewed as a tentative decision about its genre.<br>
 <a name="fn129" href="1pe.htm#fnB129"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (3:18)  The reference to the just suffering for the unjust is an allusion to Isa 53:11-12.<br>

The reference may not be to the Holy Spirit directly, but indirectly, since the Spirit permeates and characterizes the spiritual mode of existence. However, D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax, </i>343 (n. 76), states "It is often objected that the Holy Spirit cannot be in view because the two datives of v 18 (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">sarkiv</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pneuvmati</FONT> [<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">sarki</FONT>, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">pneumati</FONT>]) would then have a different syntactical force (sphere, means). But if 1 Pet 3:18 is a hymnic or liturgical fragment, this can be no objection because of `poetic license': poetry is replete with examples of grammatical and lexical license, not the least of which is the use of the same morpho-syntactic categories, in parallel lines, with entirely different senses (note, e.g., the dat. expressions in 1 Tim 3:16)."<br>

Some take it to refer to <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">pneuvmati</FONT> immediately preceding, the meaning of which might be either the Holy Spirit or the spiritual state. Others see the phrase as causal (`for which reason,' `because of this'), referring back to the entire clause, while still other scholars read the phrase as temporal (if so, it could be with or without an antecedent: `on which occasion' or `meanwhile'). None of these options is excluded by syntax. It may be significant, however, that every other time <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ejn w/|</FONT> is used in 1 Peter it bears an adverbial/conjunctive force (cf. 1:6; 2:12; 3:16 [here, temporal]; 4:4)."

It is commonly understood to be: (1) Christ's announcement of his victory over evil to the fallen angels who await judgment for their role in leading the Noahic generation into sin; this proclamation occurred sometime between Christ's death and ascension; or (2) Christ's preaching of repentance through Noah to the unrighteous humans, now dead and confined in hell, who lived in the days of Noah. The latter is preferred because of the temporal indications in v. 20a and the wider argument of the book. These verses encourage Christians to stand for righteousness and try to influence their contemporaries for the gospel in spite of the suffering that may come to them. All who identify with them and their Savior will be saved from the coming judgment, just as in Noah's day.<br>

Though they "suffered judgment" in this earthly life (i.e., they died, in the midst of physical abuse from the ungodly), they will enjoy life from God in the spiritual, heavenly realm because of the gospel (v. 6b). It clearly does not assume a second chance for conversion offered to unbelievers who had died; why would Peter urge people to suffer in this life for the sake of the gospel if he believed that mercy would be extended to all the dead in the hereafter (cf. 2:7-8; 4:1-5, 12-19)? <br>

 <a name="fn196" href="1pe.htm#fnB196"><sup>12</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:7)  Or "throwing on"; "loading." Some scholars take the participle to function imperativally, or as attendant circumstance--thus, "cast." See below for discussion.<br>
 <b>sn</b> (5:7)  <i>Casting. </i>According to D. B. Wallace, <i>Exegetical Syntax, </i>630, "Although treated as an independent command in several modern translations (e.g., RSV, NRSV, NIV), the participle [<i>casting</i>] should be connected with the verb of v 6, <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">tapeinwvqhte </FONT>[<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreektl">tapeinwqhte</FONT>, <i>Humble yourselves</i>]. As such, it is not offering a new command, but is defining <i>how</i> believers are to humble themselves. Taking the participle as means enriches the understanding of both verbs: Humbling oneself is not a negative act of self-denial per se, but a positive one of active dependence on God for help." <br>
 <a name="fn197" href="1pe.htm#fnB197"><sup>13</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:7)  Or "anxiety, burden," but using a word from the same root as the verb "cares" in the last part of the verse.<br>
 <a name="fn198" href="1pe.htm#fnB198"><sup>14</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:8)  This phrase may be an allusion to Ps 22:13.<br>
 <a name="fn199" href="1pe.htm#fnB199"><sup>15</sup></a><b>tc</b> (5:8)  Some MSS (B <i>et pauci</i>) omit the indefinite pronoun ("someone"); some have the accusative (1739 <i>Byz</i>), and others have an interrogative pronoun ["whom"] (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Igrave;</FONT>72 <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> A 33<sup>vid</sup>); but some such meaning is implied by the context whether it is explicit or not.<br>
 <a name="fn200" href="1pe.htm#fnB200"><sup>16</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:9)  <i>Grk</i> "whom," referring to the devil in v. 8. Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation.<br>
 <a name="fn201" href="1pe.htm#fnB201"><sup>17</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:9)  <i>Grk</i> "knowing," a participle that usually denotes a reason for the related action.<br>
 <a name="fn202" href="1pe.htm#fnB202"><sup>18</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:9)  <i>Grk</i> "your brotherhood." The Greek term "brotherhood" is used in a broad sense to connote familial relationships within the family of God (cf. BAGD 16 s.v. <FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">ajdelfovth"</FONT> 1). <br>
 <a name="fn203" href="1pe.htm#fnB203"><sup>19</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:9)  <i>Grk</i> "your brotherhood in the world," referring to the Christian community worldwide.<br>
 <a name="fn204" href="1pe.htm#fnB204"><sup>20</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:9)  This verb carries the nuance "to accomplish, complete," emphasizing their faithful endurance in suffering. The verb is passive in Greek ("suffering is being endured by your brotherhood"), but has been translated as an active to give a smoother English style.<br>
 <a name="fn205" href="1pe.htm#fnB205"><sup>21</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:9)  <i>Grk</i> "the same things of sufferings."<br>
 <a name="fn206" href="1pe.htm#fnB206"><sup>22</sup></a><b>tc</b> (5:10)  A few important MSS (<FONT FACE="NetBibleGreek">&Iacute;</FONT> B) omit "Jesus," but the external evidence favors its inclusion.<br>
 <a name="fn207" href="1pe.htm#fnB207"><sup>23</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:10)  The pronoun "you" is not used explicitly but is clearly implied by the Greek.<br>
 <a name="fn208" href="1pe.htm#fnB208"><sup>24</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:11)  No verb is expressed here but the verb "is" or "belongs" is clearly implied. This doxology expresses a fact for which God should be glorified (as in 4:11), rather than a wish or prayer ("may power be to him").<br>
 <a name="fn209" href="1pe.htm#fnB209"><sup>25</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:12)  The phrase <i>Through Silvanus </i>means either that Silvanus was the secretary (amanuensis) who assisted Peter in writing or composing the letter (cf. Rom 16:22) or that he carried the letter to the churches. The latter sense is more likely since this is the meaning of the Greek wording when it is used elsewhere (cf. Acts 15:23; Ignatius, <i>Letter to the Romans</i> 10:1; <i>Letter to the Philadelphians</i> 11:2; <i>Letter to the Smyrnaeans</i> 12:1; Polycarp, <i>Letter to the Philippians</i> 14), though it is perhaps possible that both ideas could be incorporated by this expression.<br>
 <a name="fn210" href="1pe.htm#fnB210"><sup>26</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:12)  <i>Grk</i> "the faithful brother, as I think."<br>
 <a name="fn211" href="1pe.htm#fnB211"><sup>27</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:12)  These are participles ("encouraging and testifying") showing purpose. The pronoun object "you" is omitted in Greek but implied by the context.<br>
 <a name="fn212" href="1pe.htm#fnB212"><sup>28</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:12)  <i>Grk</i> "in which stand fast." For emphasis, and due to constraints of contemporary English, this was made a separate sentence in the translation.<br>
 <a name="fn213" href="1pe.htm#fnB213"><sup>29</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:13)  <i>Grk</i> "the one in Babylon," which could refer to some individual woman ("she who is in Babylon") since the Greek article (here "the one") is feminine. But it is much more likely to be a veiled reference to a church (the Greek word "church" is also feminine in gender).<br>
 <a name="fn214" href="1pe.htm#fnB214"><sup>30</sup></a><b>sn</b> (5:13)  Most scholars understand <i>Babylon</i> here to be a figurative reference to Rome. Although in the OT the city of Babylon in Mesopotamia was the seat of tremendous power (2 Kgs 24-25; Isa 39; Jer 25), by the time of the NT what was left was an insignificant town, and there is no tradition in Christian history that Peter ever visited there. On the other hand, Christian tradition connects Peter with the church in Rome, and many interpreters think other references to Babylon in the NT refer to Rome as well (Rev 14:8; 16:19; 17:5; 18:2, 10, 21). Thus it is likely Peter was referring to Rome here.<br>
 <a name="fn215" href="1pe.htm#fnB215"><sup>31</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:13)  <i>Grk</i> "chosen together," implying the connection "with you" in context.<br>
 <a name="fn216" href="1pe.htm#fnB216"><sup>32</sup></a><b>tn</b> (5:14)  <i>Grk</i> "a kiss of love."
